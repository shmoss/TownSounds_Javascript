Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Timm LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365799.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Latin Rock, Spanish Rock, Rock Espa\u00f1ol", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The International Mighty Mushroom (TIMM) is a band focusing in Alternative Rock with melodies sung both in English and Spanish.

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

Lockwood Porter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8982336.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Classic Rock, Indie Rock, Folk Rock, Americana, Pop Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "M. Lockwood Porter's Communion in the Ashes is a rallying cry for the hopeless and heartbroken, its lyrics set to a soundtrack of anthemic heartland rock & roll. This is a record that addresses our modern-day social problems from a perspective of hope, encouraging those who listen to focus on activism and community-building rather than despair. Along the way, Porter delivers some of the most engaging, electrifying songs of his career, rooting these melodic calls-to-action in the stomp and epic swagger of a five-piece road band.\n\nBorn into a working-class family in rural Oklahoma, Porter launched his songwriting career after relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area, kicking things off with 2013's Judah's Gone. There, in the nation's most expensive real-estate market, he also taught classes to underprivileged students at an inner-city school, a job that gave him a close-up view of the nation\u2019s growing class divide and its many symptoms, including poverty, gentrification, and homelessness. As his cross-country touring increased, so did the presence of political and social issues within his music, with 2016's How to Dream Again taking influence from the socially-conscious works of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. After writing 2019's Communion in the Ashes, Porter returned to Oklahoma with the goal of contributing to a growing artistic community and, hopefully, affecting social change.\n\n\u201cThe tech boom of the last 10 years has totally transformed the whole Bay Area, and has essentially made it a playground for the rich. Working-class folks and artists aren't welcome there anymore, and this has manifested in rising housing costs, closure of music venues, and the proliferation of homeless tent cities,\u201d Porter divulges. \u201cIn the last verse of the title track, I can see in hindsight that I was saying a \u2018goodbye\u2019 to the Bay Area, even though I didn't know that I'd be leaving at the time.\u201d\n\nWith Communion In The Ashes, Porter crystallizes a sound that is uniquely his own: one that gatecrashes the borders between indie rock & roll, singer/songwriter folk, and Americana. Written alone on the acoustic guitar and recorded with Porter's band during a collaborative, five-day studio session in Chico, CA, the album champions togetherness as an antidote to the immense problems we face as a society. On the kinetic title track, a kick drum bangs out a steady pulse while Porter unveils his game plan: \"When the bridges are all burned, let's congregate the masses, let's hold a new communion in the ashes.\" The song doesn't turn a blind eye to the desperation of today's world; instead, it builds something new from the rubble, transforming desolation into hope. A similar feeling imbues the piano-propelled \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019,\" a secular hymn that nods to Porter's childhood days in the Southern Baptist church. If \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019\" evokes the solemnity of Sunday morning, though, the bulk of Communion in the Ashes rustles up the thrill of Saturday night. There are furiously strummed power chords, pounding percussion, vocal harmonies, and 80s-inspired synthesizers, shot through with a voice that's urgent, compelling, and quick to incite. These are songs about revolution and rebuilding, and Porter sings them accordingly, his voice echoing and rattling its way between the electric guitars and upright piano.\n\nGiven the album's communal emphasis, it's appropriate that Communion in the Ashes is also Porter's most collaborative release. All five band members contributed to the arrangement process, with drummer Peter Labberton pulling triple-duty as the album's engineer and mixer. The band worked swiftly, foregoing rehearsal in favor of instinctual performances and quick studio decisions. \"Get Back to the Wild,\" the one song not recorded live, gave the band a chance to experiment, building a two-bar drum and piano loop into a spiritually-minded song that examines the distance between human nature and human society. Porter and company looked to their own influences for cues, too, with Communion's touchstones running the gamut from Leonard Cohen\u2019s inventive songwriting and Tom Petty's concise melodies to Wilco's experimentation and War on Drugs' gorgeously textured tones. Even so, this is the most distinctive release in M. Lockwood Porter's catalog \u2014 an album that both nods to the past and pushes forward to the future, thanks in part to a full-band attack that lends fire, ferocity, and grit to the tracklist.\n\n\u201cI think the fully collaborative recording process was the biggest musical shift between recording How To Dream Again and Communion In The Ashes,\u201d explains Porter. \u201cJeremy Lyon has been playing in my live band since 2016, but this was the first M. Lockwood Porter album that he\u2019s worked on, and he brought a much wider palette of guitar tones to this album than I've used on past records. This is also the first time I\u2019ve recorded with synthesizers. I had given the band the vague direction that I wanted us to imagine ourselves as a \u2018dystopian gospel band\u2019 before we started recording, and my keyboardist Jeff Hashfield found a sound on his Prophet synthesizer that we ended up dubbing the \u2018Blade Runner church organ.\u2019 We ended up using it on nearly every song.\u201d\n\nThroughout Communion In The Ashes, Porter\u2019s electrifying \u201cdystopian gospel band\u201d explores how frightening our world can be. The record\u2019s enthralling cover art \u2014 designed by William Schaff, known for his longtime association with Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina \u2014 shines a light on that horrifying present, depicting a man (A preacher? An organizer? A demagogue?) addressing a crowd from the foreground of a burning, decaying city. With its Springsteen-sized catharsis, though, Communion in the Ashes offers listeners something new: a soundtrack with which to rise up, rebuild, and renew. Call it protest music if you'd like. Call it a political album if you must. Whatever the description, Communion in the Ashes packs the strongest punch of Porter's career, capturing not just one man's reaction to the present day, but an entire community's opportunity to better their own tomorrows.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dryes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9957553.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Alt-country, Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The first time the public got a taste of country duo The Dryes was in May 2018.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "Live from Cordovas HQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kaskade ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8440390.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Cosmic Disco, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Kaskade is the stage name for Ryan Raddon, a DJ/producer/remixer/artist who was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1972, raised in Salt Lake City, Utah as a teen, and now calls San Francisco, California home.\n\nPrior to being a recording artist, he was a record store owner and a club DJ at a nightclub in Salt Lake City as a way to make ends meet for him and his wife.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pioneer 11 LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10301137.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Electronic Rock, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Named after NASA\u2019s 1973 robotic space probe of the same name, the duo of Pioneer 11 creates transmissions from cosmic coordinates where the spacecraft is adrift, the oxygen levels are low, but the view is spectacular.

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service.

He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control. It\u2019s his music, done his way.\n\n( Jon Hartley Fox )", "otherInfo": "THURSDAY NIGHTS LIVE #9\nw/Tony Furtado & Stephanie Schneiderman\nCo-presented by - KAFM Community Radio\nSpirit Sponsor - Brooks Wine\nSpecial guests - James Low/Luke Price\n\nLooking forward to this Thursday's show!

There isn\u2019t a weak track on the album, and Heyer\u2019s voice is stronger than ever. Sweet Action opens with the delicious mid century ring of vibraphone and roiling snare. Heyer quickly establishes a psychedelic feel\u2013somewhere between Bowie\u2018s Space Oddity and Floyd\u2018s Dark Side\u2013 and the album is instantly established as an orchestra you\u2019re allowed to play loud.

The songs continue to fall out of Heyer just so, building a brick-and-mortar solid album without weakness. \u201cSong for the Top of the Mountain\u201d is as epic as its title suggests: triumphant guitar escalates up an epic track to the sound of marching drums. \u201cGhostly Glow\u201d is perhaps the album\u2019s best song, like an \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d that trades acoustic arpeggio for damn depressing cello, and lays down some supernatural allegory about perspective. Heyer\u2019s nimble mastery over the guitar can be experienced in full on \u201cThe Letter.\u201d Perfect strums trade bars with scale runs in a song so strikingly beautiful you almost don\u2019t notice how good his singing is.

The depths of her voice unlimited, she is already a fast festival favourite.\n\nKaren has that rare gift to communicate the unspeakable. Cameron Adams, from the Herald Sun, says, \u201cMs Andrews has one of those authentic sounds you hear. You can tell she has lived and loved.\u201d Her sensibility allows the audience to surrender to the music; the experience is mutually warm and commanding.

She manages to be both imperial yet vulnerable.\u201d\n\nKaren had to know how to get the best from every instrument, every singer. To do so, she called upon the music she loved as a young girl \u2013 Soul. Blues and Gospel. In the crowded Andrews family home in Koonawarra, a young Karen listened to her brother\u2019s Motown records and the satin voice of Stevie Wonder. Singing along to those golden hits, and traditional Polynesian songs, was merely part of everyday family life; This would become the foundation of her original style \u2013 Oceanic Blues.\n\nOceanic Blues is the newest sub-genre of the Blues. Oceania\u2019s narrative tradition and the introduction of American Blues, Soul and Gospel since the 1960s, has shaped this distinctive style. The roots of the sound are gritty guitar, glowing valves, lush tremolo and deep reverb in a distinctively fluid Oceanic expression. This sound carries the mood and tones of Oceania expressed in rich, warm vocal tones.\n\nKaren Lee Andrews debuts her new sound and EP \u201cFar from Paradise\u201d. This EP mines the vibrant blues and soul at the heart of her musical heritage.\n\nAndrews mostly tours as a formidable trio, teaming up with Yanya Boston on drums and Adam Ventura on bass \u2013 two exceptional musicians.

She has opened for Eli Matthson (America's Got Talent) and Emi Meyer at the National Cherry Blossom Festival, has played Celebrate Fairfax (headliners included Joan Jett, Blues Traveler, and Ok Go), opened for Theresa Andersson, a Swedish musician featured in 'Rolling Stone', at DC9, and played with Rosi Golan at Bloombars. Flo heads the local chapter of Just Plain Folks, an international music networking organization and has performed and sold out of her debut cd in venues across New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.\n\nThe last two years have proven to be a whirlwind for Flo. She shot a music video for her song Uh Oh which won the Grand Prize on OurStage.com! The same song was one of 5 finalists in a Cosmo Radio contest, winning her an interview and airplay on Sirius Radio. After a live audition, she was selected for the 2010 Artist Roster at the world renowned Strathmore Music Hall and invited to play the mansion in 2012. Flo was the only DC based musician selected to play Merriweather Post Pavilion as part of the Virgin Mobile Free Fest's Busking Brigade, where she joined an impressive bill: Weezer, Blink 182, the Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand. She was selected for a CMJ showcase in NYC, a GAP campaign in Charlottesville, and a feature video on the website for the National Association of Broadcasting. She has played for the Secretary of the Interior, performed at the National Press Club, and sung the National Anthem at a Washington Freedom game.\n\nFlo's new album, \"No Dustbunnies\", recorded with Chris Keup (O.A.R., Erin McKeown), Stewart Meyers (Lifehouse), and Brian Jones (Dave Matthews Band, Mandy Moore), has been a best seller on both CDbaby and Digstation and is getting radio play in NY, CT, and the DC metro area.

During this time, he has also managed to release 4 artist albums and some of the most iconic house music tracks of the last two decades.\n\nMost people know Claude VonStroke for his smiling DJ persona touring every major city, festival, and basement after-party around the world. But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans. He is grateful to be curating, creating and performing music for a living and he knows that the reason people go to parties is to shake their booty and have fun.", "otherInfo": "Tune in this Friday for a LIVE coffee break with Claude VonStroke and Gene Farris.

Since 2011\n\nCoolanova surprises with Jazzy Chillout Pop. Their distinctive style combines elements of pop, jazz, electronics and world music, in a tongue in cheek manner, when they play rock songs in ball gown attire.\n\nThe members of Coolanova are Josanne Thomas, Brigitte Volkert and Bernhard Heck.\n\nAs a bass player, Bernhard brings a lot of live experience in a variety of styles, but his real passion is for his own songs. Inspired by Sade, Beady Belle and Morcheeba, he turned to lounge soundscapes in 2005.\n\nIn keyboardist Brigitte in 2011 he found the perfect musical ally for his way of working. Her background of classical, rock and world music with a dash of jazz completes Bernhard's vision - and they founded Coolanova. If you listen carefully, you will find inspiration from Jazzanova, Bonobo, Thievery Corporation and Lana del Rey in their complex sound.\n\nFor two years they forged the sound of the first CD \u2018Coolanova\u2019 in various places around the world, together with singer Michelle D. Walker, who contributed impressive vocal arrangements. In '4square' - Brigitte's four-square-meter home studio - they produced the debut album, which was released in 2014. It seamlessly combines interpretations of well-known songs such as 'Overload' or 'Your Love is King' with their own compositions. In the studio, they worked with drummer Manni von Bohr and percussionist Pitti Hecht, among others.\n\nSinger Josanne brought new elements to the sound with her Caribbean fire when Michelle retired to a more family life. With her warm charisma, Josanne shapes the appearance of Coolanova.\n\nThe trio's second album revolves around life, the universe and the rest. 'Perspectives' was released in 2017 with music to listen to and personal texts full of depth. Original songs fill half of the album, while the other half convinces with new interpretations of songs by Kurt Cobain, Chris Isaak and Prince.\n\nThe next production from autumn 2020 will be an explosion of musical colors.\nIt will be exciting!!", "otherInfo": "Thanks for joining our 3rd concert here!\n\nThis time we will play current pop songs and house classics.\nYou could simply listen at home, or better yet, dance like it\u00b4s New Year\u00b4s eve!

Though like almost all love stories, this one is not without its complications. Offering wistful rumination on how mental health can send shockwaves through even the most intimate and entwined of relationships, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 sees Karima strike a masterful balance of meditative and melancholy songwriting.\n\n\u201cIn a world where we sometimes feel we can\u2019t speak out, we tend to take it the worst out on people closest to us.\u201d says Karima, opening-up about the track\u2019s fragile subject matter.\nRelocating from the shores of the Irish Sea to the expansive horizons of the Pacific last year, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 was one of a number of new songs penned in Venice Beach, California, as the singer found herself instinctively drawn to the sun and sounds radiating from the West Coast and its simmering alternative scene. Finding a kindred spirit in LA producer Tim Carr (who also produced her sublime \u2018Shelf Life\u2019 track of last year), the textured and transient feel of \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 is testament to the stimulating new environs Karima found herself writing in.\n\u201cI was fantasising about making more, organic, saturated sounding records for a long time and alongside this, I wanted to record out in America as I was finding most of my musical influences were artists from America.\u201d she says. \u201cLast year I made the move to go out to California to find the sound for the new record and to immerse myself in the West Coast indie/alternative scene and out there, the relationship with Tim bloomed and the music was made.\u201d\n\nDusky of atmosphere and mellifluous of melody, the record also features appearances from close friend Simon Edwards on Bass (who notably played on Talk Talk\u2019s seminal \u2019Spirit of Eden\u2019 record; a favourite of Karima\u2019s), plus London-based singer/songwriter Klara from Sweden who feathers the record with its ethereal omnichord layerings.\n\nProduced by Tim Carr, the track was further mastered by Grammy-nominated Phillip Shaw Bova (Andy Shauf, Father John Misty).\n\n\u2018Orange Rose\u2019 arrives with a captivating video filmed in Las Vegas just before Christmas last year. \u201cI had the idea about a concept of self-destructive behaviour\u201d she says, \u201ca constant running away from our fears which potentially ends in us running away from the people who can make us whole again.\u201d Subtle of narrative and cinematic in quality, the video finds Karima lost deep in thought and caught-up between a rock and a hard place in the Nevada state city. Karima Francis is a critically acclaimed musician and songwriter, renowned for her innate ability to blend haunting melodies with honest lyrics and alluring ambiance. With an ear for music evident from an early age, Karima went on to release her debut album \u2018The Author\u2019 in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. Her consequent album\u2019s \u2018The Remedy\u2019 (2012) and \u2018Black\u2019 (2016) witnessed further acknowledgment of her artistic abilities and saw her truly begin to spread her wings.

Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Silent Running ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Snarky Puppy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371907.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Jazz, World & Latin Jazz, Soul, Funk, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With every new project\u2014hell, with every show they play\u2014Snarky Puppy hopes to do something they\u2019ve never done before. With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Entry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

At the age of ten he turned his bedroom into a small studio with a keyboard, beat machine and four-track recorder, and began enjoying music. He was previously a member of the five-man rap act known as Nappy Headz. In 2002 he founded his own label, Hard & B. T-Pain had been known locally in Florida for his work with Nappy Headz, and gained notoriety for his song \"Fucked Up\", a reworked version of Akon's \"Locked Up\". The song gained the attention of Akon, who then signed T-Pain to his newly formed Konvict Music record label. T-Pain released his solo debut single, \"I'm Sprung\", in August 2005. His debut album, Rappa Ternt Sanga, was released on November 8, 2005, under Konvict Music. The \"T\" in T-Pain actually stands for Tallahassee (Florida), and the Pains means the pain trying to get out of Tallahassee. He made the song \"I'm Sprung\" for a girl that he knew when he was younger. On BET's 106 & Park he told audiences that that girl is now his wife. T-Pain is related to the Omoegbele family. He is also known to be experimenting in the now world-famous \"Crunk-n-B\" style of music made famous by artists such as Ciara.\n\nHit singles \"Bartender Feat.

Since his 2007 debut as a leader, 7th Heaven (Between the Lines), Blaser has grown at an almost incomprehensible rate, from a straight-ahead hard bopper in his mid-twenties to an innovative free player and ever-searching composer and bandleader in his early thirties - one whose improvisational strength has received high praise from the media world over.\n\nBorn and raised in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Blaser lived in New York City for many years before relocating to Berlin, where he currently resides. He began trombone lessons at the age of 9, and his early interests ranged from Swiss folk music to American R&B and jazz. He entered the local conservatory at 14 and graduated in 2002 after being awarded prizes in both the jazz and classical spheres, including the 2000 Benny Golson Prize. Participation in the heralded Vienna Art Orchestra and European Radio Big Band eventually led to a Fullbright Scholarship, facilitating studies in the United States at the SUNY Purchase College Conservatory of Music. A year later, Samuel won the J.J. Johnson Prize in 2006.\n\nIn his relatively short career, Blaser has worked with Swiss percussion legend Pierre Favre, pianist Hal Galper, drummer John Hollenbeck, saxophonist Michael Blake and Fran\u00e7ois Houle's 5+1 group; he has worked closely with Grammy Award winning producer Robert Sadin and most recently with Billy Mintz.\n\n2015 will see Blaser touring with two trios: one with guitarist Marc Ducret featuring Danish drummer Peter Bruun and the other with French pianist Benoit Delbecq and American drummer Gerry Hemingway.

Since his 2007 debut as a leader, 7th Heaven (Between the Lines), Blaser has grown at an almost incomprehensible rate, from a straight-ahead hard bopper in his mid-twenties to an innovative free player and ever-searching composer and bandleader in his early thirties - one whose improvisational strength has received high praise from media the world over.\n\nBorn and raised in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Blaser lived in New York City for many years before relocating to Berlin, where he currently resides. He began trombone lessons at the age of 9, and his early interests ranged from Swiss folk music to American R&B and jazz. He entered the local conservatory at 14 and graduated in 2002 after being awards prizes in both the jazz and classical spheres, including the 2000 Benny Golson Prize. Participation in the heralded Vienna Art Orchestra and European Radio Big Band eventually led to a Fullbright Scholarship, facilitating studies in the United States at the Purchase College Conservatory of Music.\n\nIn his relatively short career, Blaser has worked with Swiss percussion legend Pierre Favre, pianist Hal Galper, drummer John Hollenbeck and saxophonist Michael Blake, and has worked with Grammy Award-winning producer Robert Sadin, and more recently with Daniel Humair and Michel Portal.\n\n2018 will see Blaser touring with his trio featuring French guitarist Marc Ducret and Danish drummer Peter Bruun.

No one cared (apart from that one guy who wanted to hear Snapcase). Over that summer, he took his first regular night, acting as second DJ in the second room of a rock night held in a dance club. This was slightly successful, lasting a crazy three-ish months. Later that year, he and a couple of guys were given the opportunity to put on a student rock night at the NTU student venue. Still without a clue what they were doing, they persevered, honed their craft, and created the mighty organ now known as Assault, which has been running ever since, and going from strength to strength. At a similar time, he was resident at Nottingham's Pitty Patt Club burlesque revue, playing 50s rock n' roll and showtunes. And providing music for the performers to remove their clothes to. Naturally. Fast forward to 2008, and DJ Apocalypse was approached by the then-new Redeemer Clubnights to fill a residency at their Leicester venue, a venture which saw him play venues from London to Newcastle, and providing the backstage music for the High Voltage and Sonisphere festivals, as well as the prestigious Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards Ceremony. In the last couple of years, he has also picked up another couple of residencies; at Perdition in Nottingham, and Wake The Dead in Woking. Along the way, he's guested at a variety of nights and events, including the famous Wendy House's 10th birthday extravaganza, the Bizarre Ball, the Rammstein aftershow party at London's O2 Arena, and for the last three years the mighty Download Festival.

Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry. The four of us are family.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Larkin Poe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10345598.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Country, Country Blues, Roots Rock, Blues-rock, Blues, Rock, Alternative Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Our new album SELF MADE MAN will be out on June 12!

It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

They hauled a 350 seat theatre from town to town and set up in mall parking lots hosting community celebrations. (chronicled in the book \u201cOff The Map\u201d) He recorded 4 CDs with Upstream.\n\nIt was these experiences that forged the Russ Rosen Band sound. Roots rock with a celtic Gospel twist. Percussive guitars and fierce drums anchoring the energetic folk songs.

The previously most recent album, 2014\u2019s Too Bright, stepped out saucily onto a bigger stage, expressing, with the production help of Adrian Utley, emotions arranged all along the slippery continuum from rage to irony to love. Now here we have seized the vocabulary of the full expression of all music.\n\nWHAT IS THIS\nHere in 13 ferocious and sophisticated tracks, Mike Hadreas and his collaborators blow through church music, makeout music, an array of the gothier radio popular formats, rhythm and blues, art pop, krautrock, queer soul, the RCA Studio B sound, and then also collect some of the sounds that only exist inside Freddy Krueger. Tremolo on the electric keys. Nightclubbing. Daywalking. Peter Greenawaying, Springsteening, Syreetaing.\n\nWHY\nLuridness was a quality of music in the 1960s that is mostly since shunned. The big male crooners were all fiercely lurid as an expression of passion or lustiness or general dickability. That\u2019s something perfect to take back. You took us to church and told us to believe in ghosts. You took us to school and told us to believe in the great American project of inclusion. Instead we started fucking to the great American project of rock and roll. There\u2019s more than one sexy soul song here. Seduction is also spellcraft. Rock and roll was an incantation, a beg to give it up baby. It\u2019s not that different from begging Some Thing to not let you die when you are alone and afraid.\n\nA QUICK BREAK ABOUT HOW\nBlake Mills \u2014 the one who produced the Alabama Shakes record and who performs with John Legend \u2014 produced the record with precision and expansion. Some things are pretty and some are blasted beyond recognition. In the studio with Shawn the engineer, Mike and Blake would hear quite different voices as they worked and they built this together.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC OF WHY\nGod is all around actually and some of these songs are about being equal and some are about the witchcraft of believing. This is church music the same way Prince\u2019s Black Album is \u2014 too dirty. It\u2019s femme art pop the way Kate Bush\u2019s The Dreaming is \u2014 too scary. Prayer is indistinguishable from OCD but feels a lot cleaner.\n\nLIFE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE EACH STRIVE FOR HAPPINESS\n1. \u201cI felt like when I made these other albums, people were like why are you talking about these things, and now people are going to be like, why aren\u2019t you talking about these things, because everything\u2019s so terrible. I\u2019m never not talking about it. My life is existing in the fucking face of it. My music will always be in protest.\u201d\n2. \u201cI pay my rent. I\u2019m approaching health. The things that are bothering me personally now are less clear, are more confusing. I don\u2019t think I really figured them out with these songs. There\u2019s something freeing about how I don\u2019t have it figured out. Unpacking little morsels, magnifying my discomfort, wading through buried harm, laughing at or digging in to the embarrassing drama of it all. I may never come out the other side but it\u2019s invigorating to try and hopefully, ultimately helpful. I think a lot of them are about trying to be happy in the face of whatever bullshit I created for myself or how horrible everything and everyone is.\u201d\n3. \u201cI can steal from people that are on the inside and act as if. I created my whole identity around never being on the inside.\u201d\n\nLISTENING IN\nWho gets to live now? That\u2019s a question up for active international debate. Lots of folks are getting a clear view into what they all think of us. When we can, we should not have to care. You should feel great listening here, even when you\u2019re sad. Our job is to find love and connection and goodness. Records like this, records that make you feel like you\u2019re 15 and just seeing the truth for the first time, are excessively rare. They\u2019re here to remind you that you\u2019re divine.\n\n--Choire Sicha", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ajeet Kaur ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10379928.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Sacred Traditions, World Fusion, Mantras, World Music", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ajeet Kaur is a recording artist, yogi, and healer.

R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out. I feel blessed to be able to write as much as I do. It gives me an opportunity to share some of myself with the fans.\u201d By Andrew Miller, Nashville Music Guide", "otherInfo": "J.R.

Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP.

It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

Now here we have seized the vocabulary of the full expression of all music.\n\nWHAT IS THIS\nHere in 13 ferocious and sophisticated tracks, Mike Hadreas and his collaborators blow through church music, makeout music, an array of the gothier radio popular formats, rhythm and blues, art pop, krautrock, queer soul, the RCA Studio B sound, and then also collect some of the sounds that only exist inside Freddy Krueger. Tremolo on the electric keys. Nightclubbing. Daywalking. Peter Greenawaying, Springsteening, Syreetaing.\n\nWHY\nLuridness was a quality of music in the 1960s that is mostly since shunned. The big male crooners were all fiercely lurid as an expression of passion or lustiness or general dickability. That\u2019s something perfect to take back. You took us to church and told us to believe in ghosts. You took us to school and told us to believe in the great American project of inclusion. Instead we started fucking to the great American project of rock and roll. There\u2019s more than one sexy soul song here. Seduction is also spellcraft. Rock and roll was an incantation, a beg to give it up baby. It\u2019s not that different from begging Some Thing to not let you die when you are alone and afraid.\n\nA QUICK BREAK ABOUT HOW\nBlake Mills \u2014 the one who produced the Alabama Shakes record and who performs with John Legend \u2014 produced the record with precision and expansion. Some things are pretty and some are blasted beyond recognition. In the studio with Shawn the engineer, Mike and Blake would hear quite different voices as they worked and they built this together.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC OF WHY\nGod is all around actually and some of these songs are about being equal and some are about the witchcraft of believing. This is church music the same way Prince\u2019s Black Album is \u2014 too dirty. It\u2019s femme art pop the way Kate Bush\u2019s The Dreaming is \u2014 too scary. Prayer is indistinguishable from OCD but feels a lot cleaner.\n\nLIFE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE EACH STRIVE FOR HAPPINESS\n1. \u201cI felt like when I made these other albums, people were like why are you talking about these things, and now people are going to be like, why aren\u2019t you talking about these things, because everything\u2019s so terrible. I\u2019m never not talking about it. My life is existing in the fucking face of it. My music will always be in protest.\u201d\n2. \u201cI pay my rent. I\u2019m approaching health. The things that are bothering me personally now are less clear, are more confusing. I don\u2019t think I really figured them out with these songs. There\u2019s something freeing about how I don\u2019t have it figured out. Unpacking little morsels, magnifying my discomfort, wading through buried harm, laughing at or digging in to the embarrassing drama of it all. I may never come out the other side but it\u2019s invigorating to try and hopefully, ultimately helpful. I think a lot of them are about trying to be happy in the face of whatever bullshit I created for myself or how horrible everything and everyone is.\u201d\n3. \u201cI can steal from people that are on the inside and act as if. I created my whole identity around never being on the inside.\u201d\n\nLISTENING IN\nWho gets to live now? That\u2019s a question up for active international debate. Lots of folks are getting a clear view into what they all think of us. When we can, we should not have to care. You should feel great listening here, even when you\u2019re sad. Our job is to find love and connection and goodness. Records like this, records that make you feel like you\u2019re 15 and just seeing the truth for the first time, are excessively rare. They\u2019re here to remind you that you\u2019re divine.\n\n--Choire Sicha", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nicki Sbaffoni Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8549363.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Pop, Folk Rock, Acoustic, Cover Band", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With a mantra of \"strum and wail\u201d, Nicki Sbaffoni consistently surprises and delights audiences with powerful and creatively twisted versions of all your favorite songs.

My passion for music was passed down from generation to generation, but some of my earliest influences came from my dad and my love for artists like John Cougar Mellencamp, Black Hawk and Garth Brooks.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I moved to Atlanta where my brother Sean and I started the power-pop band, Loverush, which was influenced by some of our favorite artists at the time: the Goo Goo Dolls, Greenday and Cheap Trick. The band ended abruptly in 2009 when our grandparents died, then our father just a few months later. Sean moved 3000 miles away and joined the military and my music career faded. I worked a landscape job and married the love of my life. My marriage would later become a catalyst for change I never knew could emerge.\n\nIn 2012, my wife and I moved back home to Birmingham. I found myself in music again, learning how to make a living performing covers for the first time. Who knew playing other people\u2019s music would be a platform for finding my way again?\n\nHowever, the booze, the partying, the late nights, even the pride and selfishness that grew inside got the best of me and, therefore, my relationship. At the time of releasing, \u201cHey Y\u2019all\u201d in 2015, my first single and music video as a returning original artist, my wife left. I was on the road and we separated. I found myself alone in an empty apartment, falling deeper into my lifestyle and into a depression. After a four-day binge and an episode where I thought I might die, I finally asked for help. Tired of trying, tired of pushing, tired of losing it all to a dream; motivated by my own ego, I got down on my knees and gave it all to God.\n\nIt started with giving up my obsession with alcohol. On my road to recovery God has renewed my mind and my spirit and He has rejuvenated my sense of self-worth. A lot has changed after three years of sobriety. Since then I have started touring, surrounded myself with family and friends and finished an album that I\u2019m proud to share with the world. My hope and prayer is that my music would inspire and encourage everyone who hears to do whatever \u201cIt\u201d is; because Sooner or Later whatever \u201cIt\u201d is, is going to \u2013 so let it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aegyokiller ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Team crazy kids ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368962.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Warner Robins, United States", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Team Crazy Kids Live Streaming Concert 5.15.20 7pm est.\n\n#togetherathome #togetherathomeconcerts #share #repost #Like #NewMusic #shoptck #northsideeagles #LiveStream #Comment #2020tcktakeover #northsidegeorgia #covid_19 #teamcrazykids #Indie #2020tcktakeover #applemusic #Spotify #ZoloBeatz #larrythomasjr #Mishael #warnerrobins #ShaneYoung #Streamyard #Lum #tck #Ncole #wynterGreen #HighVol2 #dreamteam"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emily Gimble ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8139761.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Emily Gimble", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeremy And Jenn - An Acoustic Duo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10376342.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Acoustic, Pop, Rock, Dance Pop, Alternative, R&b", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Meet ?Jeremy Stimers and Jenn Taylor - a unique and energetic duo, both happily born and raised in Ontario, Canada!

When these energy centers or chakras are open then many other dimensions are open as well.\u201d \u201cMeditation\u201d aptly conjures its name with sweetly languid grooves.

We all have spiritual guides or angels who reveal certain things to us,\u201d explains JAH Boogie.\n\nDivine Spark was mixed by legendary Bob Marley recording engineer Errol Brown (Rebelution, Gregory Isaacs, Burning Spear, among others). Errol mixed the album in his makeshift studio he built in the back of Rebelution's tour bus. He worked closely with Aaron Konkol\u2019s feedback and the two came up with a majestic mix.

He has been seen outside venues at 3am in Germany playing an acoustic guitar and singing to people that didn\u2019t want the show to end. He has written poems to fans from behind bars whilst locked up on bogus marijuana charges. He has suffered a spiral fracture of the humerus while arm wrestling a marine in Hawaii. He has recorded with and toured alongside some of independent rap music\u2019s most influential figures, including Sage Francis, Busdriver and Astronautalis. He has been in bands described as hardcore, crunk rap, lo-fi synth pop, Latin progressive and psych-jazz-rap. He has crafted abstracted and personal narratives mining the depths of depression and heights of hope. He has slept on countless floors when hotels weren\u2019t in the touring budget and lost girlfriends and jobs all for the love of creating and performing.\n\nCeschi was born with four fingers on his right hand, which served as partial inspiration for the name of his DIY record label, Fake Four, Inc. Those who have worked with him describe Ceschi as one of the most artist-friendly labelheads out there, a rare breed who values art over profit almost to a fault. Since 2008, he has curated a roster of wildly original and critically praised talent and put out albums from the likes of Open Mike Eagle, Buck 65, Sister Crayon and Dark Time Sunshine in addition to his solo records The One Man Band Broke Up and Broken Bone Ballads.\n\nAn engaging, theatrical live performer, Ceschi Ramos has treated entire venues like a stage, viewing the middle of the audience or an empty barstool as good a place as any to perform a soul-baring folk song or tongue-twisting rap track. Ceschi once described himself in song as \u201ca martyr at most\u2026 a failure at least\u201d and said that, \u201cIn the eyes of history I\u2019ll be no more than a leaf on a tree.\u201d He knows what it is to suffer for his art and is aware that music exploring the ugliness and sorrow of the human condition will always exist on the fringes of a game dominated by disposable escapism and expensive publicists. Yet he still pours everything he has into his craft, and on any given night you can find him tracking vocals at his cousin\u2019s New Haven studio, warmly greeting fans and friends at a dive bar merch booth or rapping double-time in Japan or Europe for audiences that often don\u2019t speak his language, but are able to see the giant heart at the core of it all.", "otherInfo": "We are excited to announce Fake Four Fridays!

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rick Wonder ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8912713.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Electro House", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New York native Rick Wonder has become one of the tri-state area\u2019s premiere DJs in nightlife, with residencies at elite venues including 1OAK, Catch Roof and Providence.

Locally, they have headlined shows in Ontario and Quebec, including a sold-out album release party in their hometown of Windsor, Ontario.\n\nWhile continuing to ship records and merch around the world, Love Razer has been privileged to share the stage with top touring acts Gilby Clarke, BulletBoys, Tracii Guns, Anvil, and Enuff Z\u2019nuff.", "otherInfo": "LIVE from Facebook playing tunes on the acoustic, chatting with you & taking requests"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sami Chohfi - Singer/Songwriter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9135421.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Seattle, Washington", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sami is a multi-genre Singer/Songwriter.

They decided on their first name, Psychedelic Breakfast, based on the suggestion of Tramontano's cousin. It is a reference to Pink Floyd's song \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" from their album Atom Heart Mother. Besides playing cover songs by classic rockers such as The Doors and Floyd, they released a self-titled DIY studio album in 1999. The band's popularity began to rise after four songs from this album were featured on the MTV series Undressed.\n\nThe band won their first Jammy for being \"New Groove of the Year\" in 2004. Around the same time, the band decided to change their name due to misnomers of the seriousness of the band leading to the loss of booking for shows and festivals. Spears defended the choice, though, saying that \"the Music is what is important, not the name.\" While supporting their 2005 release, Real Radio, the band performed a national tour, at times backing up popular bands such as The Wailers, moe., North Mississippi Allstars, and Gomez. In early July of 2006, Giangreco left and the band continued on as a trio.\n\nThe band is also known for a high level of musicianship. In the current incarnation, instrument swapping between members is not uncommon. Guitar virtuoso Tim Palmieri also plays keyboards, drums and bass. Both Spears and Tramontano are highly proficient guitar players. Tramontano also plays the keyboards. Such swaps are usually reserved for encores, and are especially well received by fans. Members of the Breakfast also share vocal duties. While lead vocals are typically handled by either Palmieri (a baritone) or Spears (a tenor), Tramontano will occasionally act as a lead vocalist, but is most often heard providing harmonies.\n\nOn August 3rd, 2007, it was announced that Matt Oestreicher will be joining the band as the new keyboardist.\n\nwww.thebreakfast.org - Official site", "otherInfo": "Livestream: https://www.facebook.com/thebreakfast"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "New Spell ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8373287.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Darkwave, Pop, Indie, Dark Indie Pop, Indie .

Continuing on his freewheeling journey as a true musical citizen of the world, he follows the release of his acclaimed 2016 album This is Nate Najar with a warm, soulful, multi-faceted recording reflecting his enduring love for the City of Lights, entitled Under Paris Skies, Set for release on Sept. 7, 2018, on Woodward Avenue Records, the 11-track collection explores Najar\u2019s passion for French jazz and pop with a deeper commitment and purpose than ever before and showcases the \u201crabbit hole\u201d of research he did to curate a unique eclectic variety of pop, jazz and classical songs rarely re-imagined by American jazz artists.\n\nWhile a deliberate departure from the jam session vibe and stylistically diverse nature of This is Nate Najar (2016)) the new album harkens back to his theme-driven earlier projects, Aquarela Do Brasil (2014) and Blues For Night People: The Nate Najar Trio Remembers Charlie Byrd (2012). Under Paris Skies is also a dynamic showcase of the trio\u2019s latest lineup (featuring Washington, DC bassist Tommy Cecil and UK drummer Matt Home) and Najar\u2019s work on his beloved Ramirez guitar, which previously belonged to Charlie Byrd. Longtime collaborators of the guitarist, Cecil and Home toured with Najar throughout 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re a solid unit, and it felt like the right one to record the new album with\u201d the guitarist says. Chuck Redd, who has played drums on many previous Najar projects (including Aquarela Do Brasil) adds his lush vibraphone harmonies and solos to two numbers.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love Paris?\u201d Najar asks whimsically. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who says they don\u2019t want to go there, and if you\u2019ve been, how could you not want to go back? I have a love affair with France, which is a wonderful, romantic place on every level. There is such a rich cultural history, with so much global influence. Paris has traditionally been the center of many movements in classical music, but there\u2019s also an incredible legacy of pop and jazz music many Americans may not be familiar with.\u201d\n\nOne great example is the wonderful singer France Gall. Her song \u201cLa Mort Douce,\u201d featuring Najar\u2019s thoughtful acoustic improvisations and the subtle harmonic shadings of Cecil\u2019s bass, kicks off a deeply melodic, rhythmically diverse and improvisation-rich exploratory journey. Najar pays homage to legendary composer Michel Legrand via a brisk, lighthearted swing arrangement of \u201cI Will Wait for You,\u201d from the 1964 film Umbrellas of Cherbourg; Django Reinhardt, via a soulful, percussive romp through \u201cNuages,\u201d and the iconic Serge Gainsbourg with \u201cLa Javanaise,\u201d a waltz that Najar re-imagines with a spirited Caribbean vibe.\n\nAnother key stop Najar makes on Under Paris Skies is the moody, reflective title track \u201cSous le Ciel de Paris,\u201d from the 1951 film of the same name, penned by composer Hubert Giraud. The spirited \u201cCe Petit Chemin\u201d was originally recorded in the 30\u2019s by the beloved vocalist Mireille. Najar and Cecil engage in a hauntingly hypnotic guitar-bass duet of \u201cApr\u00e8s Un R\u00eave,\u201d which composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9 originally wrote for piano and soprano vocal. Redd\u2019s sensual vibes return on the Charles Aznavour ballad \u201cSa Jeunesse\u201d to join forces with Najar\u2019s strings on an easy flowing romantic adventure.\n\nUptempo, grooving jazz and swing create the buoyant rhythmic foundation of the playful yet intricately rendered Charles Trenet tune \u201cQue reste-t-il a nos amours?\u201d which became the American standard \u201cI Wish You Love,\u201d a huge hit for Keely Smith in 1958. Najar wraps up the collection with \u201cChanson du C\u0153ur Bris\u00e9,\u201d a slightly melancholy, richly improvisational ballad whose raw emotion is underscored by guitarist\u2019s scrapes on the wood; and the breezy, balmy, Brazilian leaning \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d which Najar says needs \u201cno real explanation. I tried to imagine how Joao Gilberto would approach it and gave it my best shot.\u201d\n\nThough he waited until more than a decade into his prolific recording career to create an album solely dedicated to the musical spirit of Paris, Najar has long considered Belgian born French legend Django Reinhardt as one of the guitarists who had the greatest impact on his development. The other two are Wes Montgomery and, obvious to anyone who has followed Najar\u2019s career, Charlie Byrd.\n\nHis three recordings on Candid Records \u2013 including Blues For Night People: The Nate Najar Trio Remembers Charlie Byrd and This Is Nate Najar \u2013 earned him accolades from critics and influential jazz voices alike. Becky Byrd, wife of the late guitarist Charlie Byrd, said, \u201cThere is no doubt that there is a piece of Charlie\u2019s soul in Nate\u2019s mind, heart and fingers.

For twenty years, the Madison, Wisconsin-based group has purely and fearlessly followed its inner artistic continuum.\n\nNatty Nation\u2019s unique pedigree of a Midwest home base and artistic openness has helped the posse foster a signature sound. The group describes themselves as hard roots rock reggae & dub because in addition to their honest and authentic roots reggae foundation, their embrace of soul, rock, and funk is undeniable. Natty Nation is also influenced by such diverse geniuses as Michael Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, Living Colour, Earth Wind and Fire, Fishbone, and Bad Brains. Currently, Natty Nation is led by JAH Boogie \u2013 bass & lead vocals (also percussion & drums in the studio), and musical director Aaron Konkol \u2013 keyboards, vocals, & melodica. The collective also features mainstays Paule Willis \u2013 drums, and Nick Czar \u2013 guitar.\n\nDivine Spark is a lightning bolt of an inspirational album artistically and introspectively. JAH Boogie explains: \u201cThe Divine Spark is the higher self within everyone. I've learned that through raising your vibration, and opening your chakras, you are able to tap into your divine spark.\u201d Artistically it\u2019s a watershed album as its was carefully crafted by the creative core of founding member JAH Boogie, and longtime member Aaron Konkol, who is a multi-instrumentalist and prodigious musical talent. The two shared in music writing responsibilities while JAH Boogie retained lyric duties.\n\nHighlights on Divine Spark include the title track, \u201cMeditation,\u201d \u201cCivil Rights,\u201d and \u201cProphecy.\u201d The album\u2019s spiritual core is the simmering and soulful title track. \u201cThis song deals with the spiritual essence of each human being,\u201d JAH Boogie explains. \u201cThe song also expresses that when you open your heart chakra it helps to open up the many other chakras within the spiritual body. When these energy centers or chakras are open then many other dimensions are open as well.\u201d \u201cMeditation\u201d aptly conjures its name with sweetly languid grooves. Soul rebel militancy bubbles over with the aptly titled, \u201cCivil Rights\u201d courtesy of F. Stokes\u2019s fiery rhymes. And the rousing \u201cProphecy\u201d is sure to inspire self-reflection. \u201cThis song deals with going within yourself to find out who you really are or what you really are. We all have spiritual guides or angels who reveal certain things to us,\u201d explains JAH Boogie.\n\nDivine Spark was mixed by legendary Bob Marley recording engineer Errol Brown (Rebelution, Gregory Isaacs, Burning Spear, among others). Errol mixed the album in his makeshift studio he built in the back of Rebelution's tour bus. He worked closely with Aaron Konkol\u2019s feedback and the two came up with a majestic mix.

He has been seen outside venues at 3am in Germany playing an acoustic guitar and singing to people that didn\u2019t want the show to end. He has written poems to fans from behind bars whilst locked up on bogus marijuana charges. He has suffered a spiral fracture of the humerus while arm wrestling a marine in Hawaii. He has recorded with and toured alongside some of independent rap music\u2019s most influential figures, including Sage Francis, Busdriver and Astronautalis. He has been in bands described as hardcore, crunk rap, lo-fi synth pop, Latin progressive and psych-jazz-rap. He has crafted abstracted and personal narratives mining the depths of depression and heights of hope. He has slept on countless floors when hotels weren\u2019t in the touring budget and lost girlfriends and jobs all for the love of creating and performing.\n\nCeschi was born with four fingers on his right hand, which served as partial inspiration for the name of his DIY record label, Fake Four, Inc. Those who have worked with him describe Ceschi as one of the most artist-friendly labelheads out there, a rare breed who values art over profit almost to a fault. Since 2008, he has curated a roster of wildly original and critically praised talent and put out albums from the likes of Open Mike Eagle, Buck 65, Sister Crayon and Dark Time Sunshine in addition to his solo records The One Man Band Broke Up and Broken Bone Ballads.\n\nAn engaging, theatrical live performer, Ceschi Ramos has treated entire venues like a stage, viewing the middle of the audience or an empty barstool as good a place as any to perform a soul-baring folk song or tongue-twisting rap track. Ceschi once described himself in song as \u201ca martyr at most\u2026 a failure at least\u201d and said that, \u201cIn the eyes of history I\u2019ll be no more than a leaf on a tree.\u201d He knows what it is to suffer for his art and is aware that music exploring the ugliness and sorrow of the human condition will always exist on the fringes of a game dominated by disposable escapism and expensive publicists.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rick Wonder ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8912713.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Electro House", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New York native Rick Wonder has become one of the tri-state area\u2019s premiere DJs in nightlife, with residencies at elite venues including 1OAK, Catch Roof and Providence.

Locally, they have headlined shows in Ontario and Quebec, including a sold-out album release party in their hometown of Windsor, Ontario.\n\nWhile continuing to ship records and merch around the world, Love Razer has been privileged to share the stage with top touring acts Gilby Clarke, BulletBoys, Tracii Guns, Anvil, and Enuff Z\u2019nuff.", "otherInfo": "LIVE from Facebook playing tunes on the acoustic, chatting with you & taking requests"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Breakfast ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8833164.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Progressive, Jam, Funk, Rnb-soul, Rock, Progressive Rock, Jazz, R&b/soul", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The band was formed in East Haven, Connecticut in 1998, during which time all the original members met: guitarist Tim Palmieri, bassist Ron Spears, drummer Adrian Tramontano and keyboardist Jordan Giangreco. They decided on their first name, Psychedelic Breakfast, based on the suggestion of Tramontano's cousin. It is a reference to Pink Floyd's song \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" from their album Atom Heart Mother. Besides playing cover songs by classic rockers such as The Doors and Floyd, they released a self-titled DIY studio album in 1999. The band's popularity began to rise after four songs from this album were featured on the MTV series Undressed.\n\nThe band won their first Jammy for being \"New Groove of the Year\" in 2004. Around the same time, the band decided to change their name due to misnomers of the seriousness of the band leading to the loss of booking for shows and festivals. Spears defended the choice, though, saying that \"the Music is what is important, not the name.\" While supporting their 2005 release, Real Radio, the band performed a national tour, at times backing up popular bands such as The Wailers, moe., North Mississippi Allstars, and Gomez. In early July of 2006, Giangreco left and the band continued on as a trio.\n\nThe band is also known for a high level of musicianship. In the current incarnation, instrument swapping between members is not uncommon. Guitar virtuoso Tim Palmieri also plays keyboards, drums and bass. Both Spears and Tramontano are highly proficient guitar players. Tramontano also plays the keyboards. Such swaps are usually reserved for encores, and are especially well received by fans. Members of the Breakfast also share vocal duties. While lead vocals are typically handled by either Palmieri (a baritone) or Spears (a tenor), Tramontano will occasionally act as a lead vocalist, but is most often heard providing harmonies.\n\nOn August 3rd, 2007, it was announced that Matt Oestreicher will be joining the band as the new keyboardist.\n\nwww.thebreakfast.org - Official site", "otherInfo": "Livestream: https://www.facebook.com/thebreakfast"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "King Margo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9564771.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rachel Coats & Lucciana Costa", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KING MARGO is Rachel Coats and Lucciana Costa, who met in the summer of 2016 and trusted each other immediately when they realized both their surnames were anagrams of tacos.", "otherInfo": "King Margo teams up with Jam In The Van and Sweet Relief Musician's Fund for a 45 minute show feat. giveaways and raising money for a great cause!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pete Yorn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9402249.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Folk, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pete Yorn is an American singer, songwriter, and musician.

Continuing on his freewheeling journey as a true musical citizen of the world, he follows the release of his acclaimed 2016 album This is Nate Najar with a warm, soulful, multi-faceted recording reflecting his enduring love for the City of Lights, entitled Under Paris Skies, Set for release on Sept. 7, 2018, on Woodward Avenue Records, the 11-track collection explores Najar\u2019s passion for French jazz and pop with a deeper commitment and purpose than ever before and showcases the \u201crabbit hole\u201d of research he did to curate a unique eclectic variety of pop, jazz and classical songs rarely re-imagined by American jazz artists.\n\nWhile a deliberate departure from the jam session vibe and stylistically diverse nature of This is Nate Najar (2016)) the new album harkens back to his theme-driven earlier projects, Aquarela Do Brasil (2014) and Blues For Night People: The Nate Najar Trio Remembers Charlie Byrd (2012). Under Paris Skies is also a dynamic showcase of the trio\u2019s latest lineup (featuring Washington, DC bassist Tommy Cecil and UK drummer Matt Home) and Najar\u2019s work on his beloved Ramirez guitar, which previously belonged to Charlie Byrd. Longtime collaborators of the guitarist, Cecil and Home toured with Najar throughout 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re a solid unit, and it felt like the right one to record the new album with\u201d the guitarist says. Chuck Redd, who has played drums on many previous Najar projects (including Aquarela Do Brasil) adds his lush vibraphone harmonies and solos to two numbers.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love Paris?\u201d Najar asks whimsically. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who says they don\u2019t want to go there, and if you\u2019ve been, how could you not want to go back? I have a love affair with France, which is a wonderful, romantic place on every level. There is such a rich cultural history, with so much global influence. Paris has traditionally been the center of many movements in classical music, but there\u2019s also an incredible legacy of pop and jazz music many Americans may not be familiar with.\u201d\n\nOne great example is the wonderful singer France Gall. Her song \u201cLa Mort Douce,\u201d featuring Najar\u2019s thoughtful acoustic improvisations and the subtle harmonic shadings of Cecil\u2019s bass, kicks off a deeply melodic, rhythmically diverse and improvisation-rich exploratory journey. Najar pays homage to legendary composer Michel Legrand via a brisk, lighthearted swing arrangement of \u201cI Will Wait for You,\u201d from the 1964 film Umbrellas of Cherbourg; Django Reinhardt, via a soulful, percussive romp through \u201cNuages,\u201d and the iconic Serge Gainsbourg with \u201cLa Javanaise,\u201d a waltz that Najar re-imagines with a spirited Caribbean vibe.\n\nAnother key stop Najar makes on Under Paris Skies is the moody, reflective title track \u201cSous le Ciel de Paris,\u201d from the 1951 film of the same name, penned by composer Hubert Giraud. The spirited \u201cCe Petit Chemin\u201d was originally recorded in the 30\u2019s by the beloved vocalist Mireille. Najar and Cecil engage in a hauntingly hypnotic guitar-bass duet of \u201cApr\u00e8s Un R\u00eave,\u201d which composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9 originally wrote for piano and soprano vocal. Redd\u2019s sensual vibes return on the Charles Aznavour ballad \u201cSa Jeunesse\u201d to join forces with Najar\u2019s strings on an easy flowing romantic adventure.\n\nUptempo, grooving jazz and swing create the buoyant rhythmic foundation of the playful yet intricately rendered Charles Trenet tune \u201cQue reste-t-il a nos amours?\u201d which became the American standard \u201cI Wish You Love,\u201d a huge hit for Keely Smith in 1958. Najar wraps up the collection with \u201cChanson du C\u0153ur Bris\u00e9,\u201d a slightly melancholy, richly improvisational ballad whose raw emotion is underscored by guitarist\u2019s scrapes on the wood; and the breezy, balmy, Brazilian leaning \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d which Najar says needs \u201cno real explanation. I tried to imagine how Joao Gilberto would approach it and gave it my best shot.\u201d\n\nThough he waited until more than a decade into his prolific recording career to create an album solely dedicated to the musical spirit of Paris, Najar has long considered Belgian born French legend Django Reinhardt as one of the guitarists who had the greatest impact on his development. The other two are Wes Montgomery and, obvious to anyone who has followed Najar\u2019s career, Charlie Byrd.\n\nHis three recordings on Candid Records \u2013 including Blues For Night People: The Nate Najar Trio Remembers Charlie Byrd and This Is Nate Najar \u2013 earned him accolades from critics and influential jazz voices alike. Becky Byrd, wife of the late guitarist Charlie Byrd, said, \u201cThere is no doubt that there is a piece of Charlie\u2019s soul in Nate\u2019s mind, heart and fingers.

Critics have praised him for a charismatic, personally authentic performance style that has influenced other folk-pop musicians. Though he remains among the most pop-friendly of today's singer-songwriters - his songs regularly appear in hit movie and TV soundtracks , fans say he has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger more successfully than any of his songwriting peers. According to an article by Stephen Thanabalan in Rolling Stone Magazine, Paul's style has also been most notably influential in the late 1990s thru mid 2000s with his prescience vis a vis his unique music and sound: featuring a combination of dextrously deep and smooth vocals as well as raw guitar 'roots' stylistics; emulated most evidently in the industry in ensuing years with the mainstream emergence of melancholic rock and folk pop solo artistes like Rascal Flatts, James Blunt, Damien Rice and Jack Johnson.", "otherInfo": "ELLIS PAUL\u2019S TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOW Returns this Friday May 15th at 7:30pm EST on Facebook Live at Ellis Paul Music and More!

He began by forcing his friends to watch him perform to records of his dad\u2019s band, Four Saints. Later on, Stephen learned to play the trumpet in various school bands, singing in the choir, and performing in musicals.\n\nInspired by his brother, Scot Evans, and his regional success in the band, Floating Men, Stephen started his own rock band, Mean Season, in the late 80\u2019s where he began honing his songwriting skills on the guitar. After a few years of local success and radio play in Tallahassee, FL, his band moved to Atlanta, GA to try and develop into something bigger. Unfortunately, the band broke up and left Stephen to try his hand at performing solo around Atlanta.\n\nSoon the jammed highways of the big city drove him to the beautiful mountain town of Asheville, NC in 1996, where he quickly began soaking in the creative influence of his amazing surroundings. After many years of vacillating between being a professional musician and being building a nest in Asheville, Stephen is finally focused on his love for creating and performing music.\n\nIn June of 2015, Stephen recruited the True Grits and released the debut CD, \u201cSomething to Bleed\u201d. The True Grits are Brian Shoemaker - bass/lead guitar, Sam Hess - drums, and Woodstock - mandolin, along with special guests Halli Anderson of River Whyless (violin/backing vocals), his brother, Scot Evans of Floating Men (bass on \u20181000 Roses), and his mother, Barbara Evans (backing vocals on \u2018Sound\u2019).\n\n2017 marks the second release of Under the Bridge by Stephen Evans & the True Grits. This EP has 5 songs that range from rock to folk rock and describe an appreciation of Stephen's time in Asheville. Shawn Duxbury, Stephen's former bandmate in Mean Season, is a guest Grit performing lead acoustic guitar on the song 'Waiting'. The last track, 'A Rose for Emily', is a cover song written by Jeff Holmes & the Floating Men, and is based on the short story by William Faulkner of the same name.", "otherInfo": "Stephen Evans will be playing LIVE on Facebook on Saturday at 8pm EST facebook.com/stephenevansmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Leslie Mendelson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9202259.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "New York City, New York", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kristine Wriding ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9106464.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Country Music", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Country Artist KRISTINE WRIDING is a singer-songwriter who writes, records and sings songs that come straight from her heart.\n\u201cThere is a high I feel when I sing and share songs that have a powerful meaning.

A lot has changed in their 20 plus years since the band\u2019s inception but they have always found a way to persist and thrive in todays ever-changing music landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long and adventurous trek\u201d, says Jason Devore (singer/songwriter). The band was formed in Mesa, Arizona by a group of high school friends with ample ambition but no lofty expectations of what the project could become. With the release of their debut album, A Passage in Time (2002, Lava Records), the band\u2019s career gained momentum and they quickly found themselves on the road, touring extensively with acts such as Pennywise, Sum 41, Flogging Molly, H20, and many more. Over the past ten years Authority Zero has gained international acclaim, spending time on the European festival circuit as well as stints in Australia, Russia, Japan. They have released a total of six full length studio albums, many holding spots on Billboard\u2019s Chart and their music has been featured in numerous video games, tv shows, and movie soundtracks. The band\u2019s many successes have been accompanied by a few bumps in the road including a slew of line-up changes, music industry letdowns, as well as having their van, trailer and equipment stolen while on tour in Texas. The secret to their longevity is simple; keep it pure and believe in your music.\n\nNow, 24 years since the band\u2019s inception, the future remains as bright as ever for Authority Zero, consisting of singer Jason DeVore, bassist Mike Spero, guitarist Dan Aid and drummer Chris Dalley. In June of 2018, the guys got back to work at legendary Fort Collins studio, The Blasting Room (Rise Against, Descendents, NOFX) to record their seventh full length album, Persona Non Grata with producer and iconic punk drummer, Bill Stevenson (Black Flag/Descendents/ALL). \u201cThe writing process for recording our new album (Persona Non Grata) was simply awesome. The music and lyrical content came together so organically in such a short amount of time given that our last record, Broadcasting To The Nations, only came out a year ago. Mike, Dan, Chris, and I put our hearts into this one and we are all extremely proud of the work we were able to do as a collective. The music and sound are classic Authority Zero but with a slightly revised approach. For the the fans as well as ourselves we strive to give each record its own individual character and life.\u201d Said DeVore.\n\nThe new album, Persona Non Grata will be Authority Zero\u2019s first self-released studio album and will be available on December 7, 2018. There will be an album release show on December 8th at the Marquee Theater in Tempe, Arizona. The release of Persona Non Grata will be followed by an early spring European Tour in 2019 and a summer headlining tour of the United States.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream Tour 2020 continues May 15th from our home in Arizona!

When she decided to move once again, this time to devote herself to christianity in Kansas, he decided to go his own way at sixteen years-old.\n\nHNRY FLWR is a songwriter, producer, and crooner.

By the time the year was over, the album had gone viral on Spotify with over 500,000 streams.\n\nIn 2018 the success of their breakthrough debut and immersive live shows landed them a tour supporting TEEN in the U.S. and Canada.

We were standing among guitar amps, drum stands, cymbals, pedals and cases that had been drenched from a faulty ceiling. We saw a heads up penny at the edge of the door and decided to do the best we could to keep our heads up and our spirits high.\nWe have been together for three years since then. In that time we\u2019ve been paying our dues. It\u2019s undoubtedly been work but we\u2019ve had a great time nonetheless. Playing cover shows week in and week out has given us the opportunity to hone our skills as musicians, learn how to run a business and figure out who we are and what we want out of this dream.\nThere\u2019s often a stigma that comes along with being in a cover band. It can be viewed as selling out. In our experience, a cover band can be an effectual incubator for something wildly original. For instance, if you\u2019re a chef, you\u2019re most likely cooking someone else's recipe. If you\u2019re a salesman, you\u2019re most likely selling someone else\u2019s product. If you're a musician (who's making any money), you're most likely playing someone else's music. And just like the chef who can go home and cook a meal inspired by his work and the salesman can go home and successfully convince his kid to eat broccoli, musicians can learn so much from playing other people's music. This is where we find much of the inspiration to create something of our own.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a lot. For one, it IS possible to make a living playing music - even though most won\u2019t suggest it and it\u2019s not easy or glamorous. For two, not having a boss is as good as it sounds. And for three, there\u2019s nothing else we\u2019d rather be doing.\nWe\u2019ve released two EP\u2019s of original music. \u201cWinnebago Soul\u201d came out in 2017 and \u201cOnward and Upward\u201d came out in 2018. Both EP\u2019s are available on all major streaming services. We learned a lot from the creation and production of those ten tunes. But having focused much of our time in the last three years to establish ourselves as a successful cover band, we haven\u2019t focused on original music as much as we would have liked. But now we are collectively ready for a paradigm shift. Of course, we will continue our business as a cover band with the utmost passion and professionalism, but now it is time to also devote serious attention to original music. January 2019 marks the beginning of recording our first full-length album. Our hearts are full and our faith is strong. We\u2019re excited to share our journey with you.", "otherInfo": "Please share, sit back, and enjoy the show!

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed.

No Depression christened her \u201cEqual parts June Carter Cash, Nick Cave and Murder By Death.\u201d From Under the Basement magazine summed her up by saying, \u201cImagine Bill Monroe and Sid Vicious having kids together.\u201d Common Folk Music went a step further, suggesting a sound equivalent to \u201cthe glint of a switchblade held to your throat.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while Emch chose to dub her latest project the Secret Emchy Society, the truth is she\u2019s always remained clear and concise when it comes to her convictions. A singer, songwriter, author, poet, radio host and outspoken advocate for causes affecting the LGBTQ community, she\u2019s pursued both cause and craft since first opting to become a performer from the time she was a child, while singing classic cabaret songs with her mother. At age 14, she picked up her first guitar and learned to play via the Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen songbooks. Since then, her career has blossomed, thanks to time with her bands Vagabondage, Feral, Sinners Tonic, and her bluegrass band, convincingly titled Rhubarb Whiskey, whose offshoot Oakland Wine Drinkers Union, Local 88 helped broaden her musical palette. At the same time, she found herself sharing stages with other Bay Area favorites, including T Sisters, 5 Cent Coffee, Mark Growden, Pony Hunt, Foxtail Brigade, and more.\n\nAfter a succession of albums, EPs and guest appearances with such standout artists as Juno-nominated singer Carolyn Mark, the band Unwoman, and longtime collaborator Sean Malroy, Emch expanded her ambitions and founded the aforementioned Secret Emchy Society, a loose collective that features a revolving group of like-minded musicians who hop on her bandwagon during various stops along the tour. The cast currently includes Emch on vocals, guitar and accordion, Hans Winold on bass, Dillie Dauley on viola, and Eric \u201cScratch\u201d Ingerson on drums.\n\nDespite the contributions of her talented co-conspirators, the band\u2019s first offering, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville qualifies as Emch\u2019s official solo debut after years of playing and songwriting with others. She describes it as \u201can album of hard earned heartbreakers and foot stompers about good friends and hard times.\" Emch wrote all the material either in whole or with occasional input from her collaborators, making for a series of songs that rejoice and reflect, ruminate and reminisce about times both good and bad, and especially the importance of being true to one\u2019s own ideas and identity. The music celebrates a variety of vintage styles, from rowdy barn-burners and old time honky tonk, to tears-in- your beer ballads, zydeco rave-ups, and brassy collusions of country and cabaret, aiming to strike its appeal with both the mainstream and the marginalized.\n\nAs her collaborator Carolyn Mark said of Emch\u2019s music \u201cIt pairs well with whisky and hitting the streets.\u201d\n\nBased on initial impressions, the critics seem to agree. \u201cFrom the very first listen I loved this album, after which I loved it more and more with every listen...\" said Mike Morrison of AmericanRootsUK.com. \"The songs on The Stars Fall Shooting are pretty and gritty, sexy and sad,\u201d writes Jessie Lynn McMains aka Rust Belt Jessie, Racine, Wisconsin\u2019s Poet Laureate. \u201cThe music is a mix of everything from honky tonk to alt-country, to jazz and zydeco and punk, and it slides into your ears like a good blend of rye whiskies sliding down your throat. Sweet and warm, with just enough of a burn.\"\n\nNone of this ought to come as any surprise considering that Emch\u2019s literary endeavors have closely paralleled her musical output. A well recognized writer and poet, she has published five chapbooks, founded / hosted / curated the Queer Open Mic for five years, and featured at dozens of spoken word showcases including Sister Spit, the Radar Reading series, K'vetch, Writers With Drinks, as well as co-hosted a queer radio show with Lynn Breedlove. She has been interviewed on PirateCat Radio, FCC Free Radio, Revelator Radio, OutsiderWriters.com, ReadThisMagazine.co.uk, Drinks with Tony (Radio Valencia) and on NPR for her writing, her music, and, she claims, \u201cher propensity for being in car accidents that are not her fault.\u201d Notably too, she has also been featured in the Accordion Babes Calendar and was notoriously Francis Bean Cobain\u2019s favorite \u2018babe\u2019 of that year.\n\nNevertheless, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was borne from less than assuring circumstances. After burning out from years of day-job overtime, the loss of friends and family members and watching her own health decline due to the stress, Emch found herself sitting in a haunted bar in New Orleans, her spiritual second home. There she met a \u201cgrizzled and gorgeous\u201d old woman who told her, \u201cCome on honey, this is New Orleans. You gotta shake your ass!\u201d The musician took the women\u2019s admonition as a sign \u2013 it was time to get down to her real work as a musical artist.\n\nThe Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was recorded at Lucky Mouse Studios in Victoria, British Columbia, with the help of vocalist/guitarist/producer Tolan McNeil and singer/pianist Carolyn Mark who trades vocals with Emch on \u201cHad Enough.\u201d \u201cShe was the first person to put me solo on a stage with a guitar in my hands,\u201d Emch recalls. In fact, it was Mark\u2019s decision to enlist Emch as her opening act for a show at the Epicurean Connection in Sonoma, California that launched the Secret Emchy Society\u2019s first official performance. Mark also recruited members of her own band, bassist Dennis Siemens and drummer/guitarist Joel Fernandes, to assist on Secret Emchy Society\u2019s debut. Other contributors include Grayson Walker on piano and accordion, back-up vocalist J. McLaughlan and Olivier Clements on brass.\n\n\u201cI flew from Oakland to Victoria and spent four days teaching the band the songs, laying down the core tracks, and making sure we were all on the same page,\u201d Emch recalls. \u201cWhat we came up with was an impressive array of harmonies, accordion, piano, upright bass, horns, drums, a whole passel of guitars, and a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEmch, who cites Hank Williams, Hazel Dickens, Shovels & Rope, Johnny Paycheck, Charles Mingus, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Bob Wills, and the Corn Sisters as key influences, went all out when it came to gathering material for the album. \u201cThere are scraps and orphans of songs that made it onto this record that were years and years old,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are songs on this record that were less than two weeks old when they were recorded. All I know is that I threw every bit of myself into it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder then that the results are both highly personal and wholly contagious.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to offer the world is music, stories, and finding ways that I can throw the most powerful parts of myself into a few muddled chords and some danger,\u201d Emch insists.\n\nGiven those efforts, it\u2019s also clear that she\u2019s succeeded.\n\nFor more information and track by track descriptions, go to http://www.emchy.com", "otherInfo": "Join JBird McLaughlin and Secret Emchy Society as they play you some songs, tell you some tales, and give you a behind the scenes look at the making of the new album The Chaser!

From 2008-14, he played with his band the Humadors, and their 2011 release, The Love Show, hit the Roots Rock chart\u2019s Top 50.\n\nIn 2016 Hubbard collaborated with Nashville producer and 3-time Grammy Nominee Ken Coomer to release the self-titled solo album Dan Hubbard. \u201cI was truly happy with it,\u201d Hubbard says. \u201cI felt like I finally made the record I had always wanted to, and I wasn\u2019t in any hurry to do another one.\u201d But he had a lot more to say, and the songs on Attention cover everything from lost love and suicide, to brokenness, anger, hatred, and\u2014a running theme in all Hubbard\u2019s work\u2014the redeeming power of love.\n\nHubbard\u2014the youngest of three boys\u2014credits his brother D.J. with inspiring him to write. \u201cMy older brother started writing songs, and he was really good. Seeing his talent made me believe I might have it in me too.\u201d he says. At age nine, Hubbard\u2019s other brother, Erik, died from brain cancer when he was just 12. By 15, Dan discovered guitar as an outlet. \u201clyrics started coming pretty effortlessly as I learned to play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThe feeling I experienced when I finished a song\u2026I wanted to keep feeling that.\u201d After graduating from Illinois State University, Hubbard knew he wanted to pursue music, and he\u2019s been honing his craft ever since.\n\nLike his earlier work, Attention draws its subjects from Hubbard\u2019s life. \u201cI tend to be a wallflower,\u201d he says. \u201cI just observe, and life never stops giving me material. The subject matter has become more intense with this album. I\u2019m trying to meet people in their deepest, most vulnerable places, and let them know that they\u2019re not alone.\u201d What haven\u2019t changed are Hubbard\u2019s vocals, which alternate between powerful rock and blues shouts to tender inflections. His notes soothe, pulling us into the warmth of the music before his lyrics burn their message on our hearts.\n\nThe 11-song collection opens quietly enough with the first verse of \u201cRun Towards the River,\u201d as Hubbard whispers urgently, \u201cCount of three, move your feet, like you never have in your life/One last look at the years he took, now there\u2019s no time left for goodbye/Take a deep breath, watch the trees blow, hand on the handle, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d Barely audible, the lyrics quickly blossom into a warning\u2014\u201cwatch for the wicked\u201d\u2014and encouragement\u2014\u201cthere will be love waiting for you\u201d\u2014in a tune fueled by propulsive guitars and drums that mimic the desperate need to flee. \u201cThis song looks at different abusive relationships, urging the victims to realize what\u2019s happening to them\u2014and to get out,\u201d Hubbard says.\n\n\u201cPoison Words\u201d illustrates Hubbard\u2019s subtle genius by balancing swelling horn choruses with aching steel guitar, subtle gospel piano flourishes, and shimmering roots rock guitars. Hubbard says he wrote the song out of his frustration with the church. \u201cI consider myself a Christian,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are aspects of it that I struggle with.\u201d The song\u2019s chorus repeats \u201cpoison words\u201d almost like a prayer, calling into account the church\u2019s treatment of the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cScars\u201d shares the anguish and fear that Hubbard\u2019s family felt when they learned his brother Erik\u2019s illness was terminal. \u201cThe day he died wasn\u2019t the worst day,\u201d Hubbard says. \u201cIt was the day we found out he was going to die.\u201d \u201cScars\u201d is the sparsest song on the album, with the tinkling of bells and a haunting steel guitar.\n\nOn the flipside, the funky \u201cAin\u2019t No Fountain\u201d dances around the bankruptcy of our dreams, while \u201cEvery Time I See Your Face\u201d delivers a gospel-inflected jazz tune that celebrates the promise of love. It\u2019s a \u201csong about God disguised to sound like it\u2019s about a significant other,\u201d Hubbard says cheekily. Attention closes with \u201c80,\u201d a simple soul number that celebrates life, even in the face of the unknown: \u201c80 years old/Into the unknown/Scared and alone/Still love rock-n-roll.\u201d\n\nHubbard\u2019s new album reminds us that he\u2019s been here all along, writing powerful songs that touch our hearts and ask difficult questions about the world we live in. He challenges and reassures us at the same time, the hallmark of a great songwriter. \u201cWe\u2019re all struggling. I get it because I\u2019m in this, too,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to make people reflect.\u201d\n\nWhen we pay Attention, Dan Hubbard gets us to smile, cry, and think deeply about our shared human experience.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wildermiss ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371381.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A lot has happened since Wildermiss released its auspicious debut, a promising six-song EP titled Lost With You, in 2017.

From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Khris Royal ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8964801.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Funk, Rock, Rnb, Edm, Jazz", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Khris Royal was born to be a musician.

The vocal performance by band co-founder Serena Pryne was so gut-wrenching and so emotionally draining, mining the very depths of her soul that she practically collapsed into the arms of superstar producer GGGarth Richardson when it was over. That vocal take and the similarly powerhouse performances from her bandmates, came to be the template and benchmark for the rest of the album. \u201cI knew it was a powerful song with a lot of emotion behind it and I was a little intimidated to record it\u201d said Pryne. \u201cHe let me do my thing and just pour everything I had into the microphone. He said I would know when I was done.\u201d From that moment on, that song set the tone for the rest of the record. \u201cI don\u2019t know if GGGarth knew it ahead of time and planned it with that song, because he would always reference Don\u2019t Ask if we were struggling at any other moment. He set the entire tone based on that track,\u201d said guitarist and band co-founder Nick Lesyk. The entirety of Windows and Stones is just as creatively, spiritually and emotionally intense and takes the listener on an aural and experiential journey that they won\u2019t soon forget. This too is emblematic of The Mandevilles\u2019 \u2018leave it all on the floor\u2019 approach to writing, recording and especially performing the music live. And it\u2019s music that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward and unpretentious in its approach and delivery. No studio trickery, experimental flights of fancy or self-indulgence - just rock and roll. \u201cBeing a Canadian, I think it\u2019s funny that I describe it as American rock and roll. I say that because it\u2019s reminiscent of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen - all rolled into one. Our music comes from the same place.\u201d said Lesyk. Pryne and Lesyk are the creative nucleus of The Mandevilles and have been musical partners for nearly 15 years, although both bring significantly different musical influences to the table. \u201cSerena\u2019s influences are steeped more in the roots of rock and roll whereas mine are a little more contemporary. But there are a lot of commonalities: we love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. And then there are newer songwriters like Ryan Adams and Jason Isbell,\u201d said Lesyk. As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

The Army of Broken Toys's stage show exorcises personal tragedies and cleaves its audience's hearts with rollicking apocalyptic waltzes and powerful rock ballads that seem to emerge from under their ringmaster Walter Sickert\u2019s top hat. While The Toys are on stage one feels psychically kidnapped to their \u2018Portable Carnival\u2019. The WIREFOREST boasts 7 musicians (guitars, upright bass, drums, viola, mandolin, broken toys, melodica, accordion, ukulele, flute...) and rolls with a surreal troupe of any number of midway and burlesque performers, The Bunny Collaborative. The Army of Broken Toys offers a unique rock club run-away to the circus experience.\n\nWalter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have been making as much noise nationally as they do locally. With a steady foundation of coverage by Boston press including The Boston Globe, The Boston Herald, the Noise and The Phoenix; the Army of Toys has also been featured nationally on NPR\u2019s Here and Now, All Songs Considered and on MuchMusic. Walter Sickert was named Best Artist 2011 and 2012 in the Boston Phoenix Reader's Poll and his visual art was part of the Art is Evil touring stage/music/art show and art book sponsored by Amanda Palmer\u2019s million dollar Kickstarter with a small group of artists like Frances Bean Cobain, Neil Gaiman, DJ Spooky, Shepard Fairey, David Mack etc. Walter has also been featured for the last six years as a part of the RPM challenge sponsored by New Hampshire\u2019s The Wire. The band has continued to participate in the challenge every year since its inception. The Toys have successfully funded two Kickstarter campaigns, and produced a 40+ show run of their original 'steampunk musical for people who hate musicals,' \"28 Seeds\" a cautionary tale for our time writ by the band's resident playwright/mustache, Meff and produced by Liars and Believers. The play originated from the \"last radio show\" RPM '10 project.\n\nThe \u201crollicking, raunchy sideshow of jolly, wheezing menace and delight\u201d live experience of Walter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have taken the band across the US and beyond, playing such revered venues as the Hynes Convention Center for First Night for four years, The Boston Center for The Arts, Boston Symphony Hall, 930 Club in DC, Webster Hall in NYC, Royce Hall in LA, Mod Club in Toronto, the Stone Pony in NJ, and the Melkweg in Amsterdam etc. Their live antics have earned them a Boston Music Award nomination for Best Live Act and headlining spots at Steampunk World\u2019s Faire. They have garnered opening spots alongside international contemporaries the Tiger Lillies, Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys, The Humans (featuring Toyah Wilcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), The Dresden Dolls, Amanda Palmer (solo), Chester French, etc. at several venues.\n\nWith their newest album, Soft Time Traveler and tour plans in the US and Europe, there is so much more to come from the BRoken TOys!\n\n\n(((((((((THE PRESS MONSTER))))))))))))\n\n\u201cThrough it all, Walter Sickert anchors the performance pounding out strong melodies and baying these fierce, fuming lyrics and damn if it doesn\u2019t come off as revelry...

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

Additionally, the singer/songwriter wrapped up a successful residency at the Hotel Caf\u00e9 in LA and fulfilled her dream of performing at the legendary Troubadour (like her heroes, Carole King and Elton John). Day\u2019s second EP, Los Angeles, was co-written with producer/songwriter Steve Solomon (known for hits like James Arthur\u2019s \u201cSay You Won\u2019t Let Go\u201d) and peaked at number 39 on iTunes. She is known for her folk-meets-country roots, but Los Angeles has more of an experimental vibe, blending in modern sounds and merging subtle synthesizers with her acoustic guitar. Steven Ward of Grimy Goods wrote that Day has \u201ca voice that cuts like silver and a penchant for honest songwriting.\u201d\n\nDay is also a well-established actress, recurring on shows such as NBC\u2019s Parenthood and Law & Order: SVU, the Freeform drama Pretty Little Liars and MTV\u2019s Sweet/Vicious. Skyler\u2019s guest starring credits include Hawaii Five-O, iZombie, and Grey\u2019s Anatomy among others.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Most clear in my memory, even amid the party that a live music backstage scene can tend to be, Will was the happiest guy in the place \u2013 clearly exactly where he wanted to be, and loving every second. This was a contagious vibe from the outset, one that Will had no trouble channeling into music that rings in the heart of the listener, and a live show as inspiring as it is entertaining. Between two acclaimed and successful albums, 2012\u2019s Rose Queen and 2015\u2019s Ringling Road, and what now clocks in at a near-decade's worth of dogged road work, William Clark Green has established himself as one of the most important voices of his genre - a voice that now pipes up again on his anticipated new album, Hebert Island.\n\nTexas is a big place, complete with fully distinct sub-territories - we reserve the right to bust into several states, should that become strategically expedient - and our traveling musical artists tend to become experts on the rich mosaic that makes up Texas' cultural geography. Will has found himself onstage in a growing portion of her 254 counties, and has called several his home; as he puts it, \"I kinda spend six years everywhere\". Childhood northeast in Tyler, high school years in College Station, college years at Texas Tech in Lubbock, early music career years in the north-central hamlet of Eastland, and lately his most urban digs so far, in Fort Worth - but deep down, Will's Cajun roots call to him incessantly, and thus southeast Texas is never far from his mind. The new album is named for Will's retreat at Hebert Island (say \"AY-Bear\", though you'll occasionally hear \"HEE-Bert\") near Beaumont, and refers to the hilltop upon which his camphouse sits - not an actual island, but a potential one, should the occasional flood come to pass; high ground is valuable in this landscape. Will considers himself a \"half-ass coon-ass\" - a distantly-descended Cajun, but one who holds a deep appreciation for that history and that way of life. \"It's a real place\", Will insists, with the feeling that only such a beloved space can foster - his family has owned it since 1869, in the early years of Reconstruction, and is where they established one of the state's first rice farming operations. It's a place that echoes through time for William Clark Green, connecting his family's past and tradition to who he is as an artist, and as a man, today.\n\nIt's been over three years since Ringling Road. \"I'm not gonna force songs,\" Will sighs. \"We could have finished the record a long time ago, but we didn't like the mixes - we're the bosses, and we don't have to listen to ourselves.\" The pressures and deadlines of the professional recording artist are nothing new, and while he certainly notices that pressure, Will recognizes it to be a good problem to have. \"I remember when no one gave a shit, so yeah, it's incredible to have that want-to. So far, every record I've come out with has been my best record - I wrote my ass off for this one. I wanted to make sure it beat Ringling Road, and I'm not bragging on myself - I just knew it was going to take effort.\"\n\nThat effort has paid off; Hebert Island is a stellar new batch of songs from a guy who has gone to great lengths to keep his energy focused, through all distraction, on quality songcraft. \"My favorite songwriter is Guy Clark - the songwriter's songwriter. It's what I've always cared about the most...the craft of songs is really where it's at for me. I think good songs are undeniable.\" Mostly recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium with Benjy Davis at the board, the new album also features players who have been backing Will for near the full ride, including guitarist Steven Marcus and bassist Cameron Moreland. \u201cGoner\u201d stands as a shimmering, no-hard-feelings take on the moment of breakup, the protagonist of the quasi-travelogue \u201cStay\u201d understands that it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, as long as you\u2019re close to love, and the ballad \u201cShe Loves Horses\u201d exemplifies both the warmth and strength that\u2019s developed in Will\u2019s songwriting and the performance power of his players.\n\nWill's desired contribution to the world is songs that change lives for the better, and he realizes that he's conduit as much as creator for that change. And in spite of - or, perhaps, because of - the demands and pressures of the life he's chosen, and the position of leadership he's earned through a decade of determination, William Clark Green is a guy who takes none of this for granted. \"Our path is guided by something that's greater than me, I believe that.

His introduction to music came through his family: the early influence of Jimi Hendrix from his brothers, Bluegrass, Folk and Mountain music from both his parents, and boogie woogie from his grandmother.\n\nHis love for the Blues and American Roots Music began to blossom after moving to Texas at the young age of 5. His uncle gave him a copy of \"The Vaughan Brothers: Family Style\" and he was hooked. He got his first SRV album shortly after, and was off into the world of Blues. He began digging deeper and deeper for the nastiest, grooviest, and raunchy sounds he could find and focused his list of influences to include Albert King, Howlin' Wolf, Hound Dog Taylor, Elmore James, Lightnin' Hopkins, Lightnin' Slim, Albert Collins, Otis Rush, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, and the list GOES ON!! He sat in with bands from the time he was 11 years old and began meeting and playing with musicians in the San Antonio Blues scene. Thanks to local SA sax legend Frank Rodarte, Will landed a weekly Friday night gig while in the 7th grade, and 3 or 4 years later landed another weekly gig and began refining his chops.\n\nDuring his senior year of high school, the band got the opportunity to open for and back up the great Stephen Stills in Austin, TX. From there he moved on to other inspiring moments in music, opening for Lynard Skynard, Three Dog Night, and quite a few other notable acts.\n\nAfter graduating from school he co-formed his own group in the style of Classic Country and Rock! The band played legendary Texas venues such as Luckenbach, TX and Gruene Hall. After that Will began playing with anyone and everyone and opened solo for greats such as Dick Dale. When he was 22, he traveled to France to play with \"Mitch Webb & The Swindles\u201d at the Crappone Country Rendezvous Festival. It was there he met the Great-Nephew of Texas Country Legend Ernest Tubb. He joined the band and began touring the USA and Europe with Lucky Tubb and the Modern Day Troubadours. After getting a bit burned out on the party lifestyle on the road, he left the Troubadours to get back to what he does best, playing Roots/Blues, and writing his own material.\n\nIn 2013 he released his first self-produced album \"Travelin' Man\" and proceeded to play all across the State of Texas, and various other places in the Continental U.S.\n\nCurrently, Will is performing full time with legendary Texas rockabilly group Two Tons Of Steel, touring throughout Texas, the Mid-West US and Europe. To keep up with Will's schedule with Two Tons, check out www.twotons.com. However, in the mean time, Will continues to write, record, perform and sit in with many notable seasoned musicians in the San Antonio area, including the Texas Tornados, among many others.

If you require a set of vocal jazz standards for the first set, sing along favorites for the second and then full on dance music for the third set, Ryan 7 offers that kind of flexibility.\n\n\n\nRyan 7 are a duo of seasoned pros who understand how to interpret a crowd and to deliver exactly what is needed.\n\n\n\nRyan7 is made up of two seriously magnificent forces of nature: Mighty Mike Hilliard and Sassy Sabrina Weeks.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Ryan7 has over 500 songs in our repertoire and we are constantly adding new material.\n\n\n\nWe offer several shows to choose from:\n\n50s 60s Show\nThis show bounces you between greaser and hippie, between dancing the twist, the mashed potato and catching butterflies in a Psychedelic Haze. Some of the songs included in this set are Let's Do the Twist, We're Having a Party, Shake, Rattle and Roll, Tracks of My Tears, Love the One Your With, Proud Mary, Together, Heard it Through the Grapevine, and many more. This is one of our most requested shows. This show can be up to 3 sets of 60 minutes each.\n\n\nClassic Rock Show\nThis show is a mostly uptempo dance show. Classic rock is the best of rock from the 60s through to the 80s. We perform songs by Bob Seger, CCR, the Doobie Brothers, Dire Straights, ACDC, ZZ Top, Van Morrison... all your favorites. This show can be up to 3 sets of 60 minutes each.\n\n\nRockin' Country Hits Show\nThis is one of our favorite shows to perform. We perform the best of rockin' country starting with classic country such as Patsy Cline and Willie Nelson and then strongly focus on the country from the 80s and 90s such as Garth Brooks, George Straight, and Lorrie Morgan. Then we add some current country such as Miranda Lambert, Taylor Swift and the Band Perry to make the evening complete. This show is a guaranteed crowd pleaser for any country fan. This show can be up to 3 sets of 60 minutes each.\n\n\nLight Dinner Music (including acoustic jazz and blues) Show\nThe best thing about Ryan7 is the flexibility that we offer. We can easily start off your event with acoustic jazz and blues dinner music performed at exactly the right volume. We also offer a complete evening of this if that is what your event requires. Some sample songs performed in this show are Stormy Monday, Can't Hear a Word You Say, God Bless the Child, Wonderful World, At Last, Sunday Kind of Love, and much more. This show can as short as a mini set or up to 3 sets of 60 minutes each.\n\n\nBest of the Hits (50s to Current) Show\nNot sure what you'd like? That's ok too. We can play a little of all the popular genres and create a fun dancing or listening environment for your event attendees. Mighty Mike Hilliard and Sassy Sabrina Weeks are seasoned veterans who offer you the benefit of years and years of live entertaining. Because of this, they can read a room and know what songs work best.

But 99 Neighbors love to upend expectations. So the fact that they come from a woodsy hometown, far away from any anywhere people expect rap groups to come from, is only the beginning.\n\n\nA sprawling collective of rappers, singers, songwriters, producers, instrumentalists, and visual artists, 99 Neighbors challenges our preconceived notions of what a band even is. The lineup has evolved fluidly throughout its formation (although it\u2019s more or less set these days). No one person does just one thing, so the vocalists also make beats, and someone making beats one day might be directing a music video the next.\n\n\nIf you need help keeping them all straight (we feel you), that lineup currently consists of:\n\nSam Paulino (rapper/singer/songwriter)\n\nHank \u201cHANKNATIVE\u201d Collins (rapper/singer/songwriter)\n\nAidan Ostby (singer/songwriter)\n\nConnor \u201cSwank\u201d Stankevich (rapper/songwriter)\n\nCaleb \u201cSomba\u201d Hoh (producer/engineer/composer/songwriter)\n\nJulian \u201cJuju\u201d Segar-Reid (producer/multi-instrumentalist/composer)\n\nJared \u201cJFear\u201d Fier (DJ/producer)\n\nShane Kaseta (photographer/designer)\n\n\nLike so many other great bands, 99 Neighbors began as a friendship, or rather a couple of them. Sam and HANKNATIVE grew up together in Burlington, playing football and lacrosse together on their high school teams and rapping at house parties on weekends. Somba (the group\u2019s creative powerhouse, who has a hand in everything including production and videos) and Juju grew up together too. The two duos connected when Sam reached out to Somba over SoundCloud and realized they lived a quarter of a mile away from each other. Shane, another friend from high school, became the group\u2019s photographer and graphic designer. He was a founding member with the original vocalists and Somba when the group formed in 2018.\n\n\nAfter high school, the group\u2019s core moved in together in a dingy apartment in downtown Burlington to work on music full-time. The open-door policy they instituted quickly turned the place into a hub of the city\u2019s creative community where artists of all backgrounds and inclinations could jump into the mix (and crash on the couch if they needed to). Among them were Swank, who met the other rappers through basketball and freestyling at parties, and Aidan, who was involved when Sam and Somba first started working together, who would both become full-fledged members.\n\n\nAs 99 Neighbors grew into a collective with intentional blurry boundaries (hence the name), the core of the group squeezed into Somba\u2019s bedroom for two months to record their debut full-length, Television, an ambitious collection of songs showcasing the diversity of the group\u2019s talent, and an equally wide range of music they draw from, blending post-trap hip-hop with jazz and rock, soulful textures with electronic experimentation, undeniable hooks with the kind of hard-hitting brain-twistingly complex raps that you always hear people complaining no one\u2019s making anymore. It was at this point that Jared (a Boston native and the only member of the group not from Burlington) began DJing and producing with the group. By the time Television dropped at the beginning of 2019, 99 Neighbors was the biggest rap act in Burlington. Its reception online proved that the appeal wasn\u2019t just a local thing\u2013when the band alerted Reddit to its release their post generated so much traffic that the site took it down, mistakenly thinking it was the work of bots.\n\n\nIn February, Television single \u201cChampion\" caught the attention of Chance the Rapper\u2019s longtime manager Pat Corcoran, who soon after posted it on his Instagram. That opened up a conversation that led to a trip to Chicago, and eventually a deal to kick off a brand new collaboration between Corcoran\u2019s entertainment company Nice Work and Warner Records.\n\n\nFor the recording of their upcoming album, 99 Neighbors are going for a change of scenery.

Some of them I talk to everyday, and they give me music ideas! They keep me going,\u201d she says, reflecting on the creator-founded platform.\n\nMelodies rich in folksy, Americana roots, paired with empowering, honest lyrics are stunningly showcased in Welling\u2019s forthcoming, full length album High Heels and Heavy Things. Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft. Meyers, FL). She\u2019ll be a featured artist at the \u201cSongwriters Island Showcase\u201d in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in 2020, and will be opening once again for Delta Rae and David Cook (Summer Tour 2020). In the interim she\u2019s logged countless hours on the road, performing at venues and house concerts across the US, as well as an international tour through Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things will be available on iTunes and Spotify worldwide in Summer of 2020.

But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others.

Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans.

The rest of the population will catch up. What this means is that Chromeo is really good at being Chromeo. The mission, the package, the vision\u2014it\u2019s been a straight shot of pure intentionality from the jump. These Chromeo dudes? They have the whole being-these-Chromeo-dudes thing totally wired.\n\nAnd with the benefit of blessed hindsight, we can all see now that Chromeo stuck to it with the natural doggedness of the soulful heirs that they are. Funk a game plan\u2014these guys had a ten-year battle strategy. When they released their first album in 2004, Rick James was still the Antichrist to all but the enlightened. Fast forward to today, and \u201880s funk\u2014which makes up a major part of Chromeo\u2019s DNA\u2014is all over the charts.\n\nSo it\u2019s the perfect time for a fresh dose of the real stuff and\u2014lo and behold\u2014Pee (still looking a smooth criminal in a Coogi) and Dave (ever the Semitic/Gallic heartthrob in tight pants) are back. We are officially on the cusp of the Canadian funk lords\u2019 fourth album\u2019s release. It\u2019s called White Women and it\u2019s a doozy. As a work of cultural theory, it posits that we are living in a post-nostalgia age. All previous genres and styles of music now coexist within a singularity of moves and gestures. (Ouch, sorry, got possessed by a cultural studies prof. for a second there\u2026 but the foregoing is true of Chromeo, just FYI.) More importantly, as pure entertainment, White Women perpetuates and elevates Chromeo\u2019s existing blueprint: sexy funk, ass-targeting beats, melodic honey, and smart lyrics about the foibles of contemporary love.\n\nDave 1\u2019s words continue to turn urban music clich\u00e9s on their heads. On \u201cJealous (I Ain\u2019t With It)\u201d, a Chromeo crossover comet if there ever was one, our arch antihero witnesses his ex in the arms of other guys\u2026 wearing the jacket that he bought her. Conversely, the pristinely produced \u201cOver Your Shoulder\u201d is a paean to the insecure. You\u2019re all beautiful, ladies, is the message; don\u2019t even sweat that body-image noise. And \u201cSexy Socialite\u201d is a warning to the highhanded party girls of the early twenty-teens. Check yourself, sayeth Chromeo.\n\nWhite Women is the band at its most ambitious, with both the pop and the muso elements of Chromeo pushed into the red. On the hooky side, we\u2019ve got instant classics like the soaring \u201cCome Alive\u201d and the pulsating \u201cFrequent Flyer\u201d which offer moments that would make Hall & Oates and Wham green with envy. On the crate-digger side, Dave and Pee employ an unprecedented analog arsenal that would make Kraftwerk drool. Mtume\u2019s female vocalist croons on more than half the album. Steely Dan\u2019s string conductor pops up on the progressive album closer \u201cFall Back 2U.\u201d Try all that on for size, nerds.\n\nBut for all that 80s talk, White Women, more so than any other Chrome-opus, is firmly grounded in pop\u2019s present. It features some stellar cameos, too. Solange belts it out with Dave 1 on \u201cLost On The Way Home,\u201d Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend contributes the piano-led, heartstring-pulling intermezzo \u201cEzra\u2019s Interlude,\u201d and Toro y Moi dives into the undiluted electro-funk of the aforementioned \u201cCome Alive.\u201d\n\n2014 happens to be the Year of the Horse, which makes sense because Chromeo are about gallop in on shining white steeds to delicately trample all of us with their sublime sound. The weather is perfect; the water is warm; the people are waiting. Here comes White Women to remind everyone else just how this shit is done.", "otherInfo": "Chromeo DJ Set Livestream: https://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/live-from-out-there"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Khanvict ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9125003.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Moombahton, Festival Music, Bass, Trap, Pakistani, Indian, Edm, Mid Tempo, Bass Music", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Surrey based Asad Khan (aka Khanvict) is an escape artist.

The two were also romantically involved.

On his full-length solo effort Florida, however, his sound is closer to sample-based cinematic instrumental hip hop, not unlike the work of DJ Shadow.\n\nBorn in Mississippi and raised across the southern United States, Diplo picked up much of the local culture while growing up there. Music styles such as dirty south, crunk and miami bass are now trademark ingredients of the Hollertronix output. Pentz's solo work is also influenced by Southern Gothic and other southern literature. Additionally, world music is a strong musical influence on Diplo, especially baile funk which he encountered whilst traveling in Brazil.\n\nDiplo was recently signed to Ninja Tune, on the Big Dada imprint.

Joe\u2019s songwriting skills are much in demand with greats, Elvis Costello and John Denver having recorded versions of his songs.\n\nAlong with Joe Camilleri (vocals/guitar/sax/harp) the band boast a formidable lineup with Claude Carranza (guitar/vocals), Mark Gray (bass/vocals), John McAll (keyboards/vocals) and Angus Burchall (drums).\n\n\n\u201cCatching The Black Sorrows brand of raw, rootsy, hip-shaking rock\u2019n\u2019roll feels like discovering the best bar band in the world\u201d The Dubai National\n\n\u201c\u2026you know you\u2019re in the presence of a real thumping, jangling, Mississippi-by-way-of-Melbourne rock n\u2019 roll band\u201d\nThe Skinny Edinburgh\n\n\u201cCamilleri is an Aussie rock legend and one of this nation\u2019s finest performers..the epitome of a hardworking entertainer who knows how to connect with his audience.\u201d Sydney Morning Herald", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rory Phillips (AU) ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10370469.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Blues-rock, Rock, Blues, Alt-country, Americana", "Time": "9:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Instantly recognisable by his signature hat, 13 year old Rory Phillips from Tumut has been described by one of Australian Country Music\u2019s greats, Bill Chambers (accomplished solo artist and father of Kasey Chambers), as \u201calways displaying a professional enthusiasm way beyond his years, and definitely has a way with an audience\u201d.\n\nRory fell in love with music at a very early age and (some may say surprisingly), it was the music of Joe Walsh (the \"Eagles\u201d, \u201cJames Gang\u201d), which initially hooked him. Drawn to Joe\u2019s rock and blues guitar sound, Rory was captured by the instrument and consequently, was given his first guitar at age five. Fast-forward to 2015, to an Eagles concert in the picturesque setting of Hanging Rock in regional Victoria, and young Rory shared a moment in time with his hero that he will never forget. Holding up a rain-soaked sign which read, \u201cHey Joe, I play guitar because of you\u201d, Joe saw Rory\u2019s sign during the final song, smiled and waved at him, then took two guitar picks from his pocket and asked the security guard to give them to him.\n\nFeeling more inspired than ever, Rory continued to hone his performance and playing skills, with the dream of one day being able to play like his idol. It is a tall order, but Rory continues to chip away at it. His career highlights so far include twice being named in the top ten buskers at the prestigious (open age) Tamworth Country Music Festival Busking Competition (2016/2017), being a featured busker at Byron Bay Bluesfest (2016/2017), graduating twice from the CMAA Junior Academy of Country Music (2016/2018) and Rock Academy Melbourne (2017) and being invited to play at the 2017 Melbourne Guitar Show. Rory was named the Australian National Busking Champion (primary-aged) in 2016, took out the title of Junior Tamworth Champion of Champions in January 2018 and most recently, was shortlisted for the role of lead guitarist, Zach Mooneyham, in the Australian production of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s School of Rock \u2013 The Musical.\n\nRory\u2019s influences span blues, country and rock and his performances reflect that. An aspiring songwriter, a live set is often sprinkled with some original tunes. Rory's debut six track EP, Cars and Guitars, containing three original songs, was released at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in January 2017 and has enjoyed radio airplay across the country and overseas. Rory has appeared with Australian blues legend Lloyd Spiegel (named by Australian Guitar Magazine as one of the Top 50 Australian guitarists of all time) and Bondi Cigars front man, Shane Pacey. He has supported Australian country artists such as ARIA nominated Bill Chambers and Golden Guitar winners The Bushwackers, Bennett, Bowtell & Urquhart, Catherine Britt, Amber Lawrence and Fanny Lumsden. Rory has shared the stage with former AC/DC bassist, Mark Evans, and has even played the maracas with Carlos Santana at the Byron Bay Bluesfest in 2017!", "otherInfo": "A festival in your own home!\n\nTickets $4 AUD"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Georgia Maq ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10145952.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "9:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Georgia McDonald has established herself in recent years as the singer and guitarist of Melbourne, Australia indie rock band Camp Cope, whose sophomore album How to Socialise and Make Friends (Run For Cover/Poison City Records) won widespread acclaim, topping a slew of 2018 end of year lists including NPR, Pitchfork, Billboard, Bandcamp, Stereogum, The Guardian, and Brooklyn Vegan.\n\nThe impact of the trio's music on the indie landscape has been undeniable, with McDonald emerging as a brave, resilient, and often politicized figure. Using her formidable voice to fight for the betterment of the music industry and rally against sexism, racism and all forms of structural inequality, she has never shied away from the uncomfortable and difficult topics that dominate the news cycle.\n\nSo when McDonald describes her debut solo album, Pleaser (Run For Cover/Poison City Records) as \"a love album\", it's immediately clear that this is a step in a different artistic direction. \"I think the main theme is love, obviously, all kinds of love. Love that you walked away from so you could love yourself, unrequited love, forgiving love, love with no point to it,\" she explains.\n\nThe album opens strategically with \"Away From Love\" - the only time guitar is featured on all of Pleaser, with the rest of the album done entirely electronically. \"Away From Love\" and \"Like A Shadow\" were recorded with Darcy Baylis, while the other songs on the record were produced by Run For Cover Records labelmate Katie Dey.\n\nPleaser's 8 tracks shimmer and pulsate, calling to mind pop artists like Lorde, Robyn, Charli XCX and Gwen Stefani. \"I took more time to record the songs and play around with them, and I liked that because I could change things and experiment more,\" McDonald says, continuing \"I think the pressure of working with other people drove me to finish the songs, which I hated but also loved because it's nice to be challenged.\"\n\nWhile McDonald may have felt challenged while writing Pleaser, the experience of listening to the album is anything but difficult. Its unapologetic pop sentiments shine and delight, McDonald's gorgeous alto soaring above each track. It's a record listeners will find themselves quickly falling in love with and returning to again and again - and really, in times like these, who doesn't need more love songs?", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Banoffee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7929186.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Alternative, Australian, Indie, International", "Time": "9:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Banoffee's 'Do I Make You Nervous?'

The larger-than-life beat maker made a rapid and far-reaching\nimpact on the electronic music scene in 2011 when the fittingly titled debut \u2018Entrance Song\u2019 was released on Catz N Dogz\u2019 \u2018Pets Recordings\u2019 imprint, and the track went on to become championed by the likes of Carl Cox, Seth Troxler, Jamie Jones, and Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1.\n\nHis mashup of Tiga vs Audion\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s Go Dancing\u2019 \u2013 humorously entitled \u2018Dancing (Again!)\u2019 \u2013 was one of the biggest breakthrough hits of 2015, and he was soon spinning his own unique take on one of the most iconic underground dance records of all time, Green Velvet\u2019s \u2018Flash\u2019. Eats Everything has since become one of the most in demand remixers in the business, proving his remix abilities by adding the Midas touch across a wide range of tracks from the likes of Fatboy Slim, Niles Rodgers, Jamie Jones, Disclosure, Four Tet, Matador and Booka Shade.\n\nAfter winning DJ Magazine\u2019s \u2018Best British DJ\u2019, and becoming the only DJ ever to perform two BBC Radio 1 Essential Mixes within the space of a year, Eats Everything debuted at #13 in Resident Advisor\u2019s Top\nDJs poll during 2012. A technical wizard on the decks, his obsession with House, Techno and Disco shone through immediately, displaying the \u2018studio geek\u2019 inside the Bristolian, which led to him mixing the\n\u2018Fries With That\u2019 compilation on Hypercolour Records, launching it with a very special intimate Boiler Room set in Bristol at the beginning of 2015. Stepping things up a notch, he later took on one of the\nworld\u2019s most acclaimed mix series, fabric 86, in honour of the iconic London superclub - firmly cementing him as an underground DJ.\n\nAlways one to go with the moment rather than to meticulously plan out sets, it is this party-ready approach that saw him become a key member of the elrow family early on, playing for the world-famous\nSpanish brand as an all night resident during their Ibiza season, as well as at many of their major European festival stage takeovers and club nights. All this in addition to a continuing dizzy array of high profile\ngigs; from Awakenings Festival, Movement Detroit, Kappa Futur Festival, Paradise DC10, Coachella to the Space Ibiza closing party, and his own personal favourite, Glastonbury, where his reputation as a local hero is set in stone. Now firmly established as one of the UK\u2019s finest House and Techno exports, Eats Everything has more recently become a key part RESISTANCE, which is an integral component of the ULTRA Festival brand worldwide. Regardless of his success, Eats Everything has stayed true to his roots, never forgetting where his story began, and aside from throwing parties for family, friends and his biggest fans, he has held three \u2018Food For Thought\u2019 lectures across schools in England, talking to inspired students about his musical journey and creative processes within the studio, having honed his skills since first obtaining a pair of decks at the age of 12. In addition, he became a firm advocate for the \u2018Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\u2019 charity, aiding to provide safe clean water across Africa and India by performing very special NYE performances at The Nest and fabric in London, in honour of the organisation and donating all proceeds to the charity. Making incredible music that resonates further than just the confines of underground House and Techno, the larger than life character is known for his confidence both on camera, and on radio, where his naturally gifted hosting skills have led to the headstrong producer garnering a reputation as the people\u2019s champion. Following a hugely successful 12 month stint on the BBC Radio 1 Residency, Eats Everything was quickly appointed as a deputy host for Radio 1\u2019s Dance specialist broadcasts, allowing his boisterous persona to shine through on the UK\u2019s favourite station. His radio output doesn\u2019t end there - whilst his globally syndicated weekly \u2018Edible Beats\u2019 radio show is now airing on over 70 FM stations around the world, stretching all the way from Argentina to Australia and everywhere in between, it was recently awarded best Electronic Music show and Listeners Choice for the 2018 Mixcloud radio awards.\n\nHis Edible imprint \u2013 a joint project with fellow Bristol music legend Nick Harris \u2013 continues to go from strength to strength, releasing standout tracks from the likes of Skream, Paul Woolford, Waze & Odyssey,\nEats Everything himself and newcomers like Alex Virgo. With Edible now 15 releases in, the label continues delivering high quality House, Techno and Disco influenced records that resonate broadly and\nwith a respective nod to its past.\n\nThis year sees Eats Everything launch his new A.T.E alias and event series as he looks to diversify his musical output through a combination of live branded shows, a brand new record label in collaboration with Spanish Techno hero Andres Campo, entitled EI8HT, which also provides him a platform to release no-nonsense European techno with a British twist, and to sign music from his globally renowned peers.\n\nWith 2018 already shaping up to be the biggest and best year so far in the meteoric rise of Eats Everything, the Bristolian native has a range of solid new music soon to be released on Carl Cox\u2019s infamous INTEC imprint, which is a huge honour for him and says \u201cCarl\u2019s always been a childhood hero of mine, and a really great moment in my life was when I got to play at the Discoteca in Space before him\u201d, Dense & Pika\u2019s fledgling Kneaded Pains, along with remixes for Tiga\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Special\u201d on Turbo and an \u2018Eats Rebeef\u2019 of Size 9\u2019s classic \u201cI\u2019m Ready\u201d on Josh Wink\u2019s legendary OVUM, proving Eats Everything to be one of the most consistent premiere names on the scene.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "GoldFish ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7687978.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Tropical House, Melodic House, Organic House", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Before changing the EDM game in South Africa as GoldFish, Dominic Peters and David Poole were mild-mannered students by day\u2014and blew the roof off house parties by night.

Grooverider began his DJing career at illegal raves and warehouse parties in Britain in the late eighties, and rose to prominence with partner Fabio through his innovative sets at influential club nights such as Rage and Speed. At these nights, Grooverider championed the emerging UK breakbeat culture that would eventually split from house and techno to produce Hardcore, and then after another split it became jungle, which would in turn become known as drum and bass.\n\nGrooverider remains an influential figure in the worldwide drum and bass scene, in part due to his successful radio show on BBC Radio 1 (presented in conjunction with Fabio) which has attained a devoted audience outside the United Kingdom. Consequently, he is in great demand as a DJ and works extensively abroad as well as in the UK.\n\nAlthough Grooverider is known primarily as a DJ and presenter, he is also a recording artist and runs one of the most prestigious drum and bass imprints; Prototype Recordings. Prototype is known for its sporadic, yet highly-anticipated, releases showcasing productions from many of the biggest names in drum and bass, including Dillinja, Ed Rush, Photek and Optical.

In 2009, it won the Top Prize in the YAMAHA Asian Beat Band Competition. In the same year, its debut album \"Wan Fo Chao Zong\" (\u842c\u4f5b\u671d\u5b97) won praises from various sectors of society. In 2012, its song \"Provincial Highway 9\" was selected as the \"Best Rock Single\" in the 3rd Golden Indie Music Awards.\n\nThe band combines Western rock music with music played with Chinese instruments, such as suona (\u55e9\u5436), pipa (\u7435\u7436), erhu (\u4e8c\u80e1), gongs (\u947c\u9f13), guqin (\u53e4\u7434), and morin khuur (\u99ac\u982d\u7434), as well as Nanbeiguan, Buddhist, Taoist, Hakka, and Mongolian music.\n\n\nAll the songs are composed by the lead singer Chen Zheng-hang (\u9673\u6b63\u822a). The music elements, along with the band\u2019s performances on stage associated with \u201cTongji (\u7ae5\u4e69)\u201d that refers to the shaman, are unique among Taiwan Indie bands; therefore, they named their own music style \u201cTongji Rock.\"\n\n\nThe group\u2019s name \"ZenKwun\" originated from folk beliefs. It refers to those, in religion or clergy, self-proclaimed living Buddhas or liars claiming to have God's power and extraordinary abilities to carry out activities that are not religious, and are motivated by self-interest or political purposes. Most of these people are leaders of new sects. They recruit followers to help advertise their abilities and ideas, so that the public can believe in and enshrine them, enabling them to achieve their purpose of propaganda.\n\n\nThe head of the band, Chen, explained that the reason for using this name \"ZenKwun\" (the god\u2019s stick in Mandarin) for the group was that it is easy to remember, as it gives people a strong impression. Behind the name is the band\u2019s critique of society. He believes that some people in today's society, such as political figures, continue to use religion to hypnotize the public. This behavior is similar to that of a swindler or \u201cgod\u2019s stick.\u201d A large part of ZenKwun\u2019s music reflects such a phenomenon.\n\n\nThe name of the band also implies the music style. The original intention is to add elements of Hakka music; there are sounds of cymbals, suona, huqin, and Beiguan (\u5317\u7ba1) percussion music. These elements give the band\u2019s music a sense of being like temple fair music, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s associated with the words \"god\u2019s stick.\"\n\n\nWhen the audience hears the band\u2019s music, which combines Western rock music with oriental traditional instruments, they can\u2019t help but marvel that the musical instruments of their grandpa\u2019s generation \u2013 the suona, erhu, and gongs \u2013 can be used to make rock music like this!\n\n\nThe members of the band are often invited to perform at Hakka festivals, such as the annual Yimin Festival and the Tung Blossom Festival. Because their music is full of traditional religious folk elements, it sounds very lively and is very suitable for the occasions of celebration.\n\n\nThe band also participates in live house performances, in addition to performing at music festivals. In 2017, they took part in the closing ceremony of the Summer Universiade in Taipei and performed in a transnational cooperation with the Sibongie African Drumming and Dancing Crew to make the music of ZenKwun Band more diverse.\n\n\nAs an independent band, the creative concept of the ZenKwun is not only to let non-mainstream voices and sounds be heard, but also to criticize the absurd myth and the state of society in the spirit of rock and roll, and to present the strange situation from the perspective of the gods the folk beliefs. Their creative music will not only shock the audience, but also prompt them to think deeper about the insights hidden in their songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rinaly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9178985.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Trance", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rinaly is a Japanese music producer and DJ since 2014.

Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000. She plaid and recorded in St. Petersburg the 5 concerto's for piano from Sergei Prokofiev with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n1998 - 2014 she is invited in a.o.

There's the date they were crowned winners of The X Factor (December 11 2011), and when they scored their second UK Number 1 with their first single proper, Wings (September 2, 2012). But perhaps the moment the pop axis truly shifted was on June 5 2013 when the band's album, DNA, became the highest debut ever in the US Billboard Chart for a British female group's first album. It entered at Number 4 and eclipsed a sixteen-year-old record previously held by the Spice Girls\u2019 Spice album. Within two years, Perrie, Jesy, Jade and Leigh-Anne have gone from obscurity to being one of the biggest bands on the planet. Their growing success was further heightened with the release of their second album, Salute and its hit first single Move. Bold, confident, emotionally-resonate and bursting with character, Salute is a quantum leap forward from what Little Mix have done in the past. In May 2014 they embarked on their biggest UK tour, with dates including London's O2 Arena. They have also supported Demi Lovato on The Neon Lights Tour in the US. In 2015 the girls announced their third studio album, Get Weird, which is due to be released on November 6th. Black Magic, Little Mix\u2019s first single from the new album, was released on the 10th July and went straight to No. 1 in the UK charts, giving them their third No. 1 single to date.

Born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, CA, Perry grew up in a Christian household as the daughter of two pastors. Though she was not allowed to listen to secular music as a child, Perry later found herself captivated by Alanis Morissette and Freddie Mercury, having discovered Queen's music during a slumber party. Religious music remained at the forefront, however, and Perry released a self-titled Christian album in 2001 under the name Katy Hudson. She would later abandon the genre in favor of a pop career. At age 17, the burgeoning songwriter began working with hitmaker Glen Ballard, who had produced and co-written Alanis Morissette's chart-topping Jagged Little Pill in 1995. Several years later, she teamed up with the Matrix, a Grammy-nominated production/songwriting team whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included collaborations with Avril Lavigne, Shakira, and Korn. The Matrix had plans to record their own album, with Perry serving as one of the group's two singers. The project was ultimately shelved, but not before Perry appeared in a 2004 write-up by Blender magazine, who hailed her as \"The Next Big Thing!\" With the Matrix's unreleased album sitting in the vaults at Sony Records, Perry went back to the drawing board and ultimately signed with Columbia in 2007. Her debut single, \"UR So Gay,\" generated some online buzz with its mischievous lyrics and accompanying music video, and Perry's audience grew accordingly. In 2008 her debut album, One of the Boys, was released, and she helped promote it by joining the summer's Warped Tour and appearing in an episode of The Young and the Restless. ~ Andrew Leahey & Jason Birchmeier, All Music Guide", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Calvin Harris ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8479707.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Dance, Electronic", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Calvin Harris (born 17 January 1984), is a Scottish singer, songwriter and record producer.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Leading Edge ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9195248.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Indiepop, Folkpop, Folk, Indie, Indiefolk", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Sound of Post-Indie Folk\n\nSwedish folk-pop ensemble Leading Edge combines the love for catchy melodies and stylish production of Nordic pop with indie folk\u2019s organic instrumental qualities and lyricism.

Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant. The song Ginger Ale and Lorna Doones is a masterpiece, a hard hitting gut punch on every level- voice, melody, words, performance, instrumentation. I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "Each Saturday I'll be playing a lunchtime concert on FACEBOOK.COM/AMYSPEACE from my Closet (or screened in porch) during this strange time.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Berendmuziek ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10352838.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Country, Pop, Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "De 25-jarige Berend Riemersma, afkomstig uit Jirnsum, is in het dagelijks leven werkzaam in de buitenschoolse opvang maar zijn passie ligt bij de muziek.\n\n\n\nEind 2015 is Berend begonnen met het schrijven van eigen liedjes en om zich hier meer in te verdiepen heeft hij de hulp ingeroepen van Sytse Broersma van De Kast.

The artist has been innovatively mixing \u201880s nostalgia with modern music as Let Em Riot since 2010, creating a unique and compelling take on established songwriting conventions. His newest album, The Futurist, is a milestone for both himself and the synthwave genre.\n\nAlan Oakes is the one-man band behind Let Em Riot, and the diverse influences heard in his songs are the culmination of decades spent soaking up new music and playing in bands. An \u201880s baby, Oakes\u2019 earliest influences came from pop culture of the decade. Movie soundtracks were especially important in those formative years, with artists like Cyndi Lauper capturing his imagination from the reels of VHS tapes. Along with other pop acts of the era like Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode, these movie soundtracks remain prominent influences on the music of Let Em Riot.\n\nAn early love for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce also marked a pivotal point in Oakes\u2019 music interests, and rock and punk became increasingly influential as he grew into adolescence. Immersing himself in skate culture, he discovered punk bands that were integral to skate videos of the era, and those artists left a lasting impression on his creative direction.\n\nGrowing up in a southern California college town, Oakes also had plenty of opportunities to see local bands ply their craft. Watching live acts and listening to DJs spin records became a favorite pastime, and spending his days around the college\u2019s radio station introduced him to a wealth of new music including emo, ska, trance, drum and bass, and other contemporary genres.\n\nOakes joined his first band as a freshman in high school and quickly began developing his skills as a singer and guitarist. In time, his role in these acts expanded, and soon he was forming and fronting his own bands. He spent many years in this role writing music, playing shows, and doing the legwork promoting his bands, though as each new endeavor fizzled out and Oakes was left to start from scratch, he found he was tiring of the grind and felt the need to strike out on his own musical journey.\n\nThis led to the creation of Let Em Riot, a fresh and liberating solo project that combined everything Oakes had learned over the years as a music fan and artist. For the first time, he was free to synthesize his many influences into a focused, cohesive, and unmitigated musical expression of his own design. The project quickly developed a unique sound, picking up loyal followers from diverse genres along the way. In early 2018, his career hit a high mark when he released The Futurist through NewRetroWave, the leading record company in synthwave music.\n\nWith his songs reaching a new audience and shaping an exciting new genre of music, Oakes continues to refine and develop the sound of Let Em Riot without ever losing touch with his roots.", "otherInfo": "Live-streaming festival beginning at 2:00PM EST on NEON.FM\n\nPresented by: NEON, Retro Synth Records, Retro Reverb Records and Nightride FM.\n\nAlso Performing:\nVon Kaiser, Turbo Knight, Vampire Stepdad, Neon Nox, d.notive, Honey Beard, Neutron Dreams, Favourite, Blood Panic and Alex Vecchietti."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anti-Flag ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Punk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "'20/20 VISION' out now! https://AntiFlag.lnk.to/2020Vision\nUK & North America tour dates are on sale now!", "otherInfo": "We are stoked to once again have an all star punx cast taking over A-F Records Instagram LIVE this Saturday for TAKEOVER FEST 3!

Unter anderem wie Robert Carl Blank es alleine nur mit seiner Gitarre und Stimme schafft, eine Masse von mehr als 1000 Menschen so zu verzaubern, als w\u00fcrde er f\u00fcr jeden einzelnen singen. Der Konzertbesucher vergisst einen Abend mit dem sympathischen Fallschirmspringer aus Hamburg nur schwer, nachdem seine Songs einmal den Weg in den Geh\u00f6rgang gefunden haben. Robert ist einziges lebendes Roadmovie, der in seinen Liedern seine Erfahrung wiedergibt und das Freiheitsgef\u00fchl mit jeder Pore ausstrahlt. Mr. Blank ist der Prototyp der neuen Generation von Songwritern, die ein aufregendes, spannendes und freies Leben f\u00fchren und ihre Erfahrungen teilen wollen.\n\n\u201eWelcome all you volunteers, jokers, clowns and puppeteers\u201c hei\u00dft es gleich in der ersten Zeile seines neuen Albums \u201eFairground Distractions\u201c, das im Herbst 2016 auf den Markt kam. Robert macht hier ein gro\u00dfes emotionales Fass auf: Ein Album \u00fcber die Liebe zum Leben in seiner ganzen Unvorhersehbarkeit - die gro\u00dfe Freiheit gepaart mit bitter-s\u00fc\u00dfen R\u00fcckblicken. Es ist aber auch ein Album \u00fcber Entscheidungen im Leben geworden. Das Album zeigt wieder einmal, wie gro\u00df das Talent dieses Mannes ist, einfach gute Songs zu schreiben und zu interpretieren. Im Gegensatz zum letzten Album ist der Sound hier 60er Jahre Pop mit vielen Anleihen bei den Gro\u00dfen der Zeit. Den Hamburger mit den tschechischen Wurzeln interessieren keine Schubladen, da ihm das Leben in seiner ganzen Vielfalt daf\u00fcr viel zu schade w\u00e4re. Der inzwischen schon inflation\u00e4r gehandelte Titel des \u201eSinger/Songwriters\u201c ist bei Robert daher auch nur reine Nomenklatur, denn der Pops\u00e4nger und Songschmied ist viel mehr als das. Er ist ein rastloser und leidenschaftlicher Idealist, der sich f\u00fcr ein kompromissloses Musikerleben entschieden hat.\n\nUnber\u00fchrt von den Bequemlichkeiten des b\u00fcrgerlichen Lebens reist er bepackt mit einer Batterie von akustischen Gitarren, einem Fallschirm und einer dicken Portion Soul das ganze Jahr \u00fcber durch die Welt, sammelt Material, beobachtet und schreibt seine Eindr\u00fccke und Erfahrungen als kodierte Reiseberichte nieder. Kaum hat er ein neues Album fertig aufgenommen, gibt es schon Material f\u00fcr das n\u00e4chste. Und dabei sind seine Songs nie am Rei\u00dfbrett entstandene L\u00fcckenf\u00fcller, sondern Reisetageb\u00fccher, inspiriert von intensiven Erfahrungen auf einer selbstgebuchten Welttournee.\n\nSein erster musikalischer Reisebericht nach 10 Jahren Worldwide Travelling - das Deb\u00fctalbum \u201eSoul Circus\u201c 2008 - wurde von der Presse mit Lobeshymnen \u00fcberh\u00e4uft. Das INTRO Magazin lobte beispielsweise das liebevoll aufgenommene Album f\u00fcr seine \u201eRadiotauglichkeit\u201c und ordnete ihn als \u201eHoffnung zwischen Jack Johnson und American Idol\u201c ein. Mit seinem zweiten Album \u201eLast Time I Saw Dave\u201c (2010) konnte er sich nicht nur musikalisch weiterentwickeln, sondern auch sein Deb\u00fctalbum noch toppen. Robert Carl Blank gelang es zweifelsohne zu zeigen, dass er keine Eintagsfliege ist, und g\u00e4be es einen Soundtrack zum Leben, dann h\u00e4tte Robert ihn geschrieben \u2013 eine Wahrheit in und zwischen jedem Song, Ehrlichkeit und k\u00fcnstlerische Tiefe. Arne Schumacher (Radio Bremen) z\u00e4hlt ihn \u201eohne Zweifel zu den talentiertesten englisch textenden Singer/Songwritern in Deutschland\u201c und Heinz Rebellius (u.a. Gitarre & Bass) attestiert ihm \u201eeine au\u00dferordentliche Stimme, die Ausdruck, Volumen, Einzigartigkeit und Nat\u00fcrlichkeit in sich zu vereinen scheint.\u201c\n\nPressestimmen:\n\n\n\u201eEine au\u00dferordentliche Stimme, die Ausdruck, Volumen, Einzigartigkeit und Nat\u00fcrlichkeit in sich zu vereinen scheint\u201c (Heinz Rebellius f\u00fcr Gitarre & Bass)\n\n\u201efantastische Songs mit wunderbaren Chord-Folgen und intelligenten Texten\u201c (Merkur Online)\n\n\u201e\u2026ein Lichtblick zwischen Jack Johnson und American Idol.\u201c (INTRO Magazin)\n\n\"ein echt h\u00f6renswertes Singer/Songwriter-Album mit viel Pop-Appeal\" (amm Musik Magazin)\n\n\"die 12 Titel haben's in sich.

Fans inked vocalist/bassist AJ Perdomo\u2019s words on their skin. Bands cribbed their names from Dangerous Summer song titles. They never broke in the mainstream, but to a rabid underground audience, The Dangerous Summer were a phenomenon.\n\nNow, newly reformed and reunited with Hopeless Records, the band\u2014Perdomo, guitarist Matt Kennedy and drummer Ben Cato\u2014are ready to begin their second chapter with the release of their fourth full-length album in 2018, produced by James Paul Wisner (Underoath, Dashboard Confessional, Paramore).\n\n\u201cIn all of our minds, we thought this was never going to happen again,\u201d Perdomo says. \u201cThere was a point in my life where I thought I was never going to play another Dangerous Summer song again. But the easiest thing in the world is writing music and playing music together. It\u2019s second nature. It feels right again.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s forthcoming album, their first in four years, looks to build on an already accomplished discography. The Dangerous Summer\u2019s first three albums\u20142009\u2019s Reach For The Sun, 2011\u2019s War Paint and 2013\u2019s Golden Record\u2014were more than just critically acclaimed: They were collections of visceral, textured alternative rock that shook audiences to their core with an unrivaled musical heft and lyrical honesty. They were songs that demanded your attention, as catchy as they were introspectively vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking elements of what people always loved about the band and trying to push the limits and push things forward,\u201d Perdomo explains, noting that the band\u2019s new music is more uplifting and upbeat than the stark, bleak Golden Record, which came at a time of both personal and professional turmoil for the group. \u201cOn Reach For The Sun, we had a lot of inspiring songs,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like right now we need to pull out of this dark veil before we do anything else in our story. We\u2019re pulling out of the darkness, and it\u2019s really inspiring and uplifting.\u201d\n\nSo, as The Dangerous Summer approach the next stage of their career, they do so with an overwhelming optimism that\u2019s never been stronger. This isn\u2019t a rehash: It\u2019s a band acknowledging their past with eyes turned squarely toward the future. Most importantly, it\u2019s a reunion led by the music instead of the ancillary trappings of the industry. In their time away, Perdomo, Kennedy and Cato had plenty of time to figure out who and where they wanted to be, and they\u2019ve all returned to the same place.\n\n\u201cNo one owes us anything,\u201d says Perdomo, who became a father during the band\u2019s hiatus. \u201cWe have to prove ourselves again. We\u2019re giving our entire selves to this. We were always just grinding so hard because we needed to do it for a living, just trying to get by. We\u2019re not going to be grinding out 100-day tours; we conquered that.

Jason, told the room off, and he was right to do so then played even harder in reaction, that impressed the shit out of me. Northern Ireland was still traumatised from its recent history, people were still trying to figure out how to be normal, I remember it very clearly and we didn\u2019t know how to dance to a great band.

Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emanne Beasha ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10323098.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Opera, Classical, Classical Crossover", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Emanne Beasha is an American singer born in 2008 who has been singing since she was two years old and has always loved performing on stage.\n\nHer first major crowd of 10,000 was when she performed the National Anthem for a spring training baseball game in Port Charlotte, Florida when she was just seven years old.

On the eve of their 10 year anniversary Swedish hardrock band HORISONT are pleased to announce the next chapter in their illustrious career by putting pen to paper and confirming a worldwide deal with Century Media Records. New album in progress, stay tuned!\n\nBIOGRAHPY, August, 2015.\nBig of moustache and tight of trouser, Horistont drink from the bottomless wellspring of inspiration that\u2019s been bubbling up through the layers of time since the birth of the blues \u2013 or Blue Oyster Cult at the very least.\n\nTheirs is a sound that harks back to the dawn of the 70s, when a new clutch of heads decided it was time to harsh the 60s hippies\u2019 mellow and paint it black; those years when the twin spirit of hard rock and prog rose to redefine sound.\nIn their earlier years Horisont looked and sounded like the last guys standing at the world\u2019s wildest and darkest party; these are the tight bro\u2019s who laced the punch, torched the dance-floor and rode off into the night on their roaring hogs in a puff of green smoke. \u201cPut the five soldiers of Horisont in a time machine 50 years ahead of time and we would still rock the silver socks of any future man, woman or robot,\u201d frontman Axel once declared.\n\nThis quintet\u2019s rock trip might be retro but their songwriting is timeless; a good melody lives forever and Horisont have songs in abundance. New album Odyssey is exactly as its title suggests: an epic journey into the known. A sonic trip. A mighty voyage of sound. You could even call their fourth full release a concept album \u2013 although they themselves prefer \u201cspace saga\u201d. Either way it\u2019s a brave band who open their album with a ten minute-long track, yet on the album\u2019s title track Horisont dive straight into the deep end, delivering space-rock with all the dexterity and deftness of the very best prog rock\u2019s finest, such as early Yes or Kansas.\n\n\u201cI think it was Tom, who during a tour, said that it would be fun to write a ten minute song,\u201d says bassist Magnus Delborg.\u201cWhen that song took shape the idea of a cohesive album was born. Most of the songs are in some way connected to the bigger theme, so \u2013 yes \u2013 it is a concept album. It concerns a supreme race of mysterious being who experiment with the creation of life and start to populate planets around the universe. And this is the story of one of those planets\u2026\u201d\n\nFormed in 2006, Horisont have spent close to a decade kicking ass, taking names and establishing themselves at the forefront of the Scandinavian retro rock revival (see also Witchcraft, Graveyard etc), injecting their sound with early-Status Quo-styled boogie blues, prog complexities, NWOBHM swagger and fire-spitting choruses set to scorch the eyebrows of the first ten rows. This is music made without irony, unafraid to acknowledge an allegiance to past greats such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Cactus, Thin Lizzy, the aforementioned Yes and Judas Priest.\n\nTheir first two albums Tva Sidor Av Horisonten (2009) and Second Assault (2012) earned Horisont a special place in the rock underground, while Time Warriors (2013) was a no-holds barred demonstration of classic rock and metal combined with a fearlessly inventive streak, and took them to a wider international audience. And now comes Odyssey, a bold leap into more expansive and ethereal musical territory. It\u2019s the band\u2019s first to feature native Australian and former Church Of Misery guitarist Tom Sutton.\n\nThe new line-up change sees a definite gear-shift too. Here Horisont play as if their lives depend upon it: dueling guitars do battle in an endlessly thrilling interplay over a rhythm section that gallops like wild horses across the frozen tundra. And cutting through the middle, Axel S\u00f6derberg\u2019s howling heartfelt vocals delivered with a space-age sense of soulfulness.\n\nThere are surprises aplenty throughout \u2013 witness the melodic Jethro Tull-style breakdown in the middle of \u2018Blind Leder Blind\u2019, flamenco/folk flourishes on \u2018Flying\u2019, the fist pumping classic metal anthem of \u2018Back On The Streets\u2019, the almost Ziggy Stardust-esque \u2018Beyond The Sun\u2019 or the elegiac eight minute long album closer \u2018Timmarna\u2019, which evokes the awesome beauty of a dying star careering off into darker distant universe. Then there\u2019s the majestic former single \u2018Break The Limit\u2019, which was accompanied by a gloriously grainy 1980s VHS-style video, complete with much split screen action. This is expansive, emotive music that\u2019s far more than five hirsute men creating a voluminous ruckus.\n\nOdyssey was recorded in Studio Kust in Gothenburg with producer by Henrik Magnusson. It was, the band explain their most harmonious creative period ever.\u201cNo Horisont recording session has ever been this good,\u201d admits Delborg. \u201cWe had worked with Henrik on our \u2018Break The Limit\u2019 single and knew that he was our guy. All the basics where recorded live in just a couple of days. Then we spent a lot of time on the intricate details.\u201d\n\nThe artwork for Odyssey harks back to both classic sci-fi paperbacks and prime prog rock albums of the 70s. \u201cWe wanted a slightly disturbed, Asimov-esque science fiction cover that told the story of Odyssey,\u201d says drummer Pontus Jordan. \u201cTom knew this guy who was really in to old science fiction stuff and he had done the cover for The Order Of Israfel. So we meet the guy and it was the one and only Henrik Jacobsen. And he really nailed it.\u201d\n\nStrap in, sit back and let the Odyssey begin\u2026", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gary Lucas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8516552.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Various", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Guitarist extraordinaire, Grammy-nominated songwriter and composer with over 30 acclaimed genre-defying albums", "otherInfo": "Gary is streaming live solo acoustic concerts on Facebook every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday @ 3pm!!\n\nIn this time of no gigs if you like what you hear, please share your appreciation!

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Entry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

Born to a musical family in Brighton UK, Marsh spent his earliest years learning the piano. In 2009, he embarked on his music production journey and spent three years studying Music Technology at University in London.\n\nMarsh\u2019s passion for electronic music began with the three disk album compilation 'Classic Euphoria\u2019. Over the years his musical tastes deepened, but always remained loyal to the emotions found in early Trance music. These early inspirations have continued to contribute to Marsh\u2019s atmospheric and melodic signature sound heard today.\n\nFollowing his debut, \u2018You'll Be Fine\u2019, released on Silk Music in June 2012, Marsh has earned the spotlight amongst many electronic dance music stars.

The show regularly appears amongst the top 10 most downloaded music podcasts on iTunes and reaches millions of global subscribers.\n\n\u2019Sleeping Now\u2019, released on Silk Music in October 2012 initially grabbed the attention of Above & Beyond and was supported as \u2018Record Of The Week\u2019 and \u2018Web Vote Winner\u2019 on their radio show.

A few years ago, singer-songwriter Jake Benjamin made a left turn from his core self of being a musician that sent him on a winding, self-reflective odyssey through states and states of mind. He announces his return to music with his aptly-titled debut EP, Finally Back Home, an exquisite collection of jazz-tinged pop.\n\n\u201cThe songs on this EP are a culmination of stints of living in Miami, Indiana, and New Jersey, where I grew up. Each song represents a different side of me. Together, this album salutes the journey back home and presents me as I am,\u201d Jake reveals.\n\nJake is one of those rare gifted artists that early on could sing better than they could speak. Yet, when it came time to go to college, Jake decided to pursue a career as a music business professional, and chose not to fine tune his prodigious talents. However, while in college, Jake became reacquainted with songwriting and discovered the beauty of jazz. \u201cI fell in love with the fact that music could be an exchange of energies between two people,\u201d Jake shares\n\nThe New York-based artist earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from University of Miami\u2019s Frost School of Music\u2019s Music Business and Studio Music & Jazz programs, and earned his master\u2019s degree from Indiana University\u2019s prestigious Jacobs School of Music where he studied voice. Because of this formal training, core to Jake\u2019s aesthetic is his sophisticated harmonic compositional vocabulary.\n\nJake tempers this studied musicality with adventurous artistic explorations via a loop station. His innovative approach with this technology treats the loop station as a compositional tool through which he explores the possibilities of vocal layering, beatboxing, and body percussion. \u201cI write original music for the sensitive and heartfelt millenial, and I reimagine jazz repertoire to make tunes my own. The stories in my songs are about me, or somebody I know. I don\u2019t like to make up stories of things I didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Jake says.\n\nThese days Jake is in New York music making within a community of musicians and friends. His next release, however, will showcase his solo artistry with a collection of songs themed around Vincent van Gogh. Theses recording will highlight concepts of the psyche, the human condition, and they will showcase Jake\u2019s innovative use of his looper station.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KDJabove HQ ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8705875.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Jazz Soul & Funk, Dub, House, Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KDJ Above is a groundbreaking music performer straight out of Denver.

We think so for sure.\n\nWhen we started this band one of our guiding notions was to get people dancing. Here in Northern Ireland it seemed to us at gigs there was a distinct lack of boogieing. I remember going to see the Von Bondies, before the Bonnevilles was a thing, in Belfast and they tore the place up but the entire room was pinned to the walls tapping feet but not shaking booty. Jason, told the room off, and he was right to do so then played even harder in reaction, that impressed the shit out of me. Northern Ireland was still traumatised from its recent history, people were still trying to figure out how to be normal, I remember it very clearly and we didn\u2019t know how to dance to a great band. Sometimes being a band thats rooted in the blues it\u2019s too easy to get weighed down by its sheer mass and heavy content.\n\nOver the years we\u2019ve written about death and love, zombies and strippers.

On the eve of their 10 year anniversary Swedish hardrock band HORISONT are pleased to announce the next chapter in their illustrious career by putting pen to paper and confirming a worldwide deal with Century Media Records. New album in progress, stay tuned!\n\nBIOGRAHPY, August, 2015.\nBig of moustache and tight of trouser, Horistont drink from the bottomless wellspring of inspiration that\u2019s been bubbling up through the layers of time since the birth of the blues \u2013 or Blue Oyster Cult at the very least.\n\nTheirs is a sound that harks back to the dawn of the 70s, when a new clutch of heads decided it was time to harsh the 60s hippies\u2019 mellow and paint it black; those years when the twin spirit of hard rock and prog rose to redefine sound.\nIn their earlier years Horisont looked and sounded like the last guys standing at the world\u2019s wildest and darkest party; these are the tight bro\u2019s who laced the punch, torched the dance-floor and rode off into the night on their roaring hogs in a puff of green smoke. \u201cPut the five soldiers of Horisont in a time machine 50 years ahead of time and we would still rock the silver socks of any future man, woman or robot,\u201d frontman Axel once declared.\n\nThis quintet\u2019s rock trip might be retro but their songwriting is timeless; a good melody lives forever and Horisont have songs in abundance. New album Odyssey is exactly as its title suggests: an epic journey into the known. A sonic trip. A mighty voyage of sound. You could even call their fourth full release a concept album \u2013 although they themselves prefer \u201cspace saga\u201d. Either way it\u2019s a brave band who open their album with a ten minute-long track, yet on the album\u2019s title track Horisont dive straight into the deep end, delivering space-rock with all the dexterity and deftness of the very best prog rock\u2019s finest, such as early Yes or Kansas.\n\n\u201cI think it was Tom, who during a tour, said that it would be fun to write a ten minute song,\u201d says bassist Magnus Delborg.\u201cWhen that song took shape the idea of a cohesive album was born. Most of the songs are in some way connected to the bigger theme, so \u2013 yes \u2013 it is a concept album. It concerns a supreme race of mysterious being who experiment with the creation of life and start to populate planets around the universe. And this is the story of one of those planets\u2026\u201d\n\nFormed in 2006, Horisont have spent close to a decade kicking ass, taking names and establishing themselves at the forefront of the Scandinavian retro rock revival (see also Witchcraft, Graveyard etc), injecting their sound with early-Status Quo-styled boogie blues, prog complexities, NWOBHM swagger and fire-spitting choruses set to scorch the eyebrows of the first ten rows. This is music made without irony, unafraid to acknowledge an allegiance to past greats such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Cactus, Thin Lizzy, the aforementioned Yes and Judas Priest.\n\nTheir first two albums Tva Sidor Av Horisonten (2009) and Second Assault (2012) earned Horisont a special place in the rock underground, while Time Warriors (2013) was a no-holds barred demonstration of classic rock and metal combined with a fearlessly inventive streak, and took them to a wider international audience. And now comes Odyssey, a bold leap into more expansive and ethereal musical territory. It\u2019s the band\u2019s first to feature native Australian and former Church Of Misery guitarist Tom Sutton.\n\nThe new line-up change sees a definite gear-shift too. Here Horisont play as if their lives depend upon it: dueling guitars do battle in an endlessly thrilling interplay over a rhythm section that gallops like wild horses across the frozen tundra. And cutting through the middle, Axel S\u00f6derberg\u2019s howling heartfelt vocals delivered with a space-age sense of soulfulness.\n\nThere are surprises aplenty throughout \u2013 witness the melodic Jethro Tull-style breakdown in the middle of \u2018Blind Leder Blind\u2019, flamenco/folk flourishes on \u2018Flying\u2019, the fist pumping classic metal anthem of \u2018Back On The Streets\u2019, the almost Ziggy Stardust-esque \u2018Beyond The Sun\u2019 or the elegiac eight minute long album closer \u2018Timmarna\u2019, which evokes the awesome beauty of a dying star careering off into darker distant universe. Then there\u2019s the majestic former single \u2018Break The Limit\u2019, which was accompanied by a gloriously grainy 1980s VHS-style video, complete with much split screen action. This is expansive, emotive music that\u2019s far more than five hirsute men creating a voluminous ruckus.\n\nOdyssey was recorded in Studio Kust in Gothenburg with producer by Henrik Magnusson. It was, the band explain their most harmonious creative period ever.\u201cNo Horisont recording session has ever been this good,\u201d admits Delborg. \u201cWe had worked with Henrik on our \u2018Break The Limit\u2019 single and knew that he was our guy. All the basics where recorded live in just a couple of days. Then we spent a lot of time on the intricate details.\u201d\n\nThe artwork for Odyssey harks back to both classic sci-fi paperbacks and prime prog rock albums of the 70s. \u201cWe wanted a slightly disturbed, Asimov-esque science fiction cover that told the story of Odyssey,\u201d says drummer Pontus Jordan. \u201cTom knew this guy who was really in to old science fiction stuff and he had done the cover for The Order Of Israfel. So we meet the guy and it was the one and only Henrik Jacobsen. And he really nailed it.\u201d\n\nStrap in, sit back and let the Odyssey begin\u2026", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emanne Beasha ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10323098.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Opera, Classical, Classical Crossover", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Emanne Beasha is an American singer born in 2008 who has been singing since she was two years old and has always loved performing on stage.\n\nHer first major crowd of 10,000 was when she performed the National Anthem for a spring training baseball game in Port Charlotte, Florida when she was just seven years old.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gary Lucas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8516552.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Various", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Guitarist extraordinaire, Grammy-nominated songwriter and composer with over 30 acclaimed genre-defying albums", "otherInfo": "Gary is streaming live solo acoustic concerts on Facebook every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday @ 3pm!!\n\nIn this time of no gigs if you like what you hear, please share your appreciation!

Forming in 1990, they have released seven albums, all through San Francisco label Fat Wreck Chords. They are widely viewed as catalysts for the pop-punk movement of the 1990's, opening the door for some of the subgenre's more mainstream bands.\n\nVocalist Joey Cape also plays guitar in punk rock cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and sang in the recently disbanded experimental punk band Bad Astronaut. Recently, he started a new project called Afterburner, which is expected to be similar to Bad Astronaut. Other members of Lagwagon include guitarists Chris Flippin and Chris Rest, bassist Jesse Buglione, and drummer Dave Raun.\n\nAfter 9 years and 5 records, the band remained silent in 1999-2000. They reunited in 2002 and released a comeback album titled Blaze in the following year. Despite the brief hiatus, the group has never broken up. In 2004, Joey released a split acoustic album with No Use for a Name frontman Tony Sly, which features acoustic versions of songs by both bands. Lagwagon's latest album, entitled Resolve, was released in October 2005 and is a tribute to the life of longtime friend Derrick Plourde (original drummer for Lagwagon and Bad Astronaut), who commited suicide on March 30, 2005.\n\nOn August 12, 2006, it was announced at punkbands.com that Lagwagon is expected to record and release a new album sometime in 2008.\n\nThey are now in the studio recording an EP entitled I Think My Older Brother Used to Listen to Lagwagon due to be released in August 2008.", "otherInfo": "\u23f0MAY 16TH ANNOUNCEMENT\u23f0\nJOEY LIVESTREAM SHOW + FACEBOOK LIVE HANG WITH LAGWAGON AFTER THE SHOW\n\nHeads up!

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit 3rd and Lindsley, Nashville"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dick Valentine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6268346.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rock, Banda, Gamelan, Free Improvisation, R&b, Free Jazz, Jazz, World Fusion", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born a while ago.

Thile had set himself a formidable musical challenge and, as befits this enthusiastically risk-embracing artist, he was more than up to the task. In addition to traveling, planning, rehearsing, and performing on the fifteen episodes of APHC\u2019s 2016\u201317 season, Thile managed each week to create a funny, topical, and at times quite poignant new song he would play with a rotating cast of APHC band-mates and guest stars. These were not throwaway radio bits, but smart, fully realized compositions. They served the needs of the show but were just as timely and engaging on their own.\n\nIn July 2017, Thile went into New York City\u2019s Reservoir Studios with producer and longtime friend Thomas Bartlett and that\u2019s when these songs gained an even deeper resonance. As they listened through the APHC versions, Thile and Bartlett realized that, taken together, these songs could form an album-length narrative. Part of the story Thile found was autobiographical. Thanks for Listening represents perhaps the most direct and personal material Thile has ever recorded. It reflects the changes to his own peripatetic life as he assumes a new role as APHC host and, behind the scenes, as a new dad\u2014while continuing to play with his band Punch Brothers and collaborate with such artists as Brad Mehldau, Edgar Meyer, and Yo-Yo Ma. We learn what delights him (like the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series,) and what alarms him (the polarized state of our nation post-election). But Thile also tells a broader tale\u2014satirically, wistfully, frankly\u2014 about the divisions and disconnects plaguing America today, whether it\u2019s on social media or at the Thanksgiving table. The overarching theme, Thile realized, was about the art of listening\u2014the joys of it, the current difficulties of it, and the necessity of hearing what others have to say, not just the overwhelming desire to be heard.\n\nListening, or the lack thereof, figures prominently on several tracks: \u201cFeedback Loop\u201d lampoons the way social media filters out all but those one agrees with, while \u201cModern Friendship\u201d rues the way old pals can drift apart\u2014and suggests that maybe sharing a well-made night cap could help solve that. \u201cStanley Ann\u201d is a graceful imagining of what Barack Obama might have said to his late mom as he departed the White House in January. The deceptively cheerful \u201cFalsetto,\u201d on the other hand, is an all-too-kind speculation on how the current occupant of the White House might gracelessly scold an activist entertainer\u2014managing to insult the singer\u2019s \u201cgirly falsetto\u201d in the process.\n\n\u201cMy initial working title was Get It out on the Radio\u201d (the name of the song he performs at the end of each APHC episode). But the album pivoted away from the show and toward the listeners\u2014and not just to the listeners of Prairie Home but to anyone who listens to things. They are my heroes\u2014people who listen. I find myself all too often on the other side of the conversation, talking about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to maintain focus or give something enough attention to appreciate it. We\u2019re in a place where listening is a precious commodity. That\u2019s the theme that I noticed rising up, greater than \u2018here is what was happening last week\u2019 or \u2018here is the place we were.\u2019 It\u2019s a celebration of people who haven\u2019t switched off, despite being given every reason to do so.\u201d\n\nThe arrangements have an intimate, dream-like quality to them; the songs feel like reveries, not statements. Thile\u2019s voice is at times double- or triple-tracked, cossetted by subtle echo. He delivers vocal takes that are by turns wry and soulful, frequently deploying a lovely falsetto in an especially evocative way, more Beach Boys than bluegrass. The chorus of \u201cThank You, New York,\u201d performed with singer Gaby Moreno, is a vocal stand-out, a nose-thumbing good riddance to the turbulent year that was 2016 (and a nod to the resilience of New York City and its occupants). Thile\u2019s mandolin playing remains front and center\u2014and it the sole instrument on \u201cBalboa\u201d \u2014but it is often bolstered by Bartlett\u2019s subtle, slightly mysterious, layering of keyboards and electronics.\n\n\u201cI was deeply desirous of a record that sounded like it was coming from your own head. That\u2019s where we veered away from a more archival studio approach\u2014where you go in, perform the songs, and record exactly how those performances sounded,\u201d Thile says. \u201cThe recordings on Thank You for Listening are more fanciful in construction.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I would be at the big room of Reservoir Studios making maps of these songs with whatever stringed instruments seemed appropriate and singing scratch vocals. Then Thomas would take them into his little room and start experimenting on them. And I would start the next map,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would get my pass by having written the song and having created a keep-able demo of the song and then Thomas would get his pass without me looking over his shoulder, telling him \u2018that\u2019s not how it goes.\u2019 Which I\u2019m unable to not do if I\u2019m in the room. It was like an editor editing a novel.\u201d\n\nLike Thile, multi-instrumentalist Bartlett is a musical polymath, comfortable in diverse collaborative situations. He often sits in with the National; he plays piano in the Irish Music group The Gloaming; and he occasionally performs on his own under the Doveman moniker. Rather than enlisting a full APHC-style band in the studio, the pair conceived the project largely as a musical dialogue between them\u2014a listening session of their own, if you will.\n\nThile manned all the stringed instruments, save for bass (from Alan Hampton) and viola (from Nadia Sirota, on the title track). Ted Poor\u2014like Hampton, a member of Andrew Bird\u2019s touring band\u2014played drums on five tracks. Bartlett provided, in Thile\u2019s words, \u201cwhatever sounds weren\u2019t accounted for.\u201d Thile also invited three guest singers to the sessions, all of whom had performed multiple times on APHC: Sarah Jarosz, Gaby Mereno, and Aoife O\u2019 Donovan. He says, \u201cAll three had made really meaningful contributions to how the songs ended up expressing themselves. That goes for all the musicians who played on this last APHC season. They all made such meaningful contributions to these songs. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\n\nThe original \u201cSong of the Week\u201d versions can be easily accessed via YouTube, now that all the APHC shows are live-streamed and subsequently archived. The performances are full of personality and humor, as Thile, a dependably energetic live performer, interacts with a roster of players that include various Punch Brothers, brilliant guitarist Julian Lage, and Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. Contrasting these versions with the new studio recordings, one can appreciate the sort of magical transformation that took place at Reservoir Studios, one that was more about inspiration than analysis.\n\nThe process effected a transformation on Thile too: \u201cBefore hosting Prairie Home, I would listen to music much the way an athlete trains. Listening was like hitting the gym, like a pitcher strengthening his rotator cuff. I was listening to improve specific aspects of my musicianship or nourish it in specific ways. The hosting has brought me back into being a music lover, just listening with the idea of enjoying the three to five minutes of a performance, not worrying about whether it\u2019s rendering my sense of counterpoint more sophisticated or increasing my knowledge of how sonata form works or giving me more arrows in my improvisational quiver.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u2018do I like this? Is my life better since listening to this song?\u2019 That\u2019s what I care about now.\n\n\u201cI think that development led me to ask Thomas to produce Thanks for Listening,\u201d Thile concludes. \u201cHe and I have stayed up late drinking Amaro and listening to records. I often hold vast amounts of myself back to analyze things and Thomas would consistently play me things that would disarm that side of me. I was yearning to make a set of music that maybe hits more of those marks, to have some of that rub off on me. I hope I succeeded with Thanks for Listening.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "otherInfo": "Live From Here with Chris Thile Broadcast: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3XOx7AS4fKGmu4zCaWgFA"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lily Detaeye Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9195887.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Alternative Folk, Indie Rock, Folk Rock, Blues-rock, Folk Singer-songwriter", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Des Moines raised.\n\nHarmonica wielding.\n\nSongstress.\n\nPeanut butter addict.", "otherInfo": "Happy hour!\n\nGrab a drink, hop on Instagram, and enjoy!\n\nDONATE:\n\nhttps://app.tikly.co/admin/events/4531/edit\n\nVenmo: lilydetaeye\n\nPayPal: lily.detaeye@gmail.com\n\nMERCH:\nhttps://lilydetaeyestore.square.site"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Will Wood and the Tapeworms ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10342033.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Cabaret, Alternative, Avant Garde, Experimental, Avant-pop, Antifolk, Indie", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Conceived in the autumn of 1992 despite the use of three forms of contraception, pianist and \"avant-pop\" singer-songwriter Will Wood stumbled out of a hallucinogenic haze and onto the New Jersey independent circuit in 2015.

He supported the record with a sporadically changing group of players in the LA club scene, including keyboardist Carey Frank (Tedeschi Trucks Band, Social Distortion), saxophonist Jeremy Trezona (Saint Motel), bassist Andrew Perusi (Hanson), and drummer Clinton Cameron (Fishbone), to name a few.\n\nOn his brand new 2020 album \u201cWildcards\u201d, Bourne finds himself not only writing and arranging, but also making his debut as producer.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off.

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe.

He eventually moved to Atlanta, where he would go on to make a name for himself as one of the most prominent Southern rappers.\n\n\nEarly years\n\nBridges began his music career as a radio personality and DJ as Chris Lova Lova on Hot 97, an urban radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. He made his recorded debut on \"Phat Rabbit,\" a track from Timbaland's 1998 album Tim's Bio: Life from the Basement. Although both Timbaland and Jermaine Dupri showed interest in signing Ludacris, he decided to release the album \"Incognegro\" independently in 1999. The album sold over 50,000 copies through the Atlanta based independent music distributor, Southern Music Distribution. The same year, he recorded the theme to the video game Madden NFL 2000. Scarface, an original member of the Geto Boys, signed Ludacris in 2000 to Def Jam Recordings, and created a new imprint, Def Jam South, around him.\n\nBack for the First Time\n\nLudacris released his major label debut, Back for the First Time, in October 2000. The album reached as high as #4 on the charts, and was a major success. Ludacris made his mark on the industry with singles such as \"Southern Hospitality\" and \"What's Your Fantasy\", along with his first ever single \"Phat Rabbit\", from 2 years prior. Back for the First Time was the beginning of Ludacris's explosion to the top of the rap world.\n\nWord of Mouf\n\nLudacris promptly completed his next album, Word Of Mouf and released it at the end of 2001. Its lead single, \"Rollout (My Business)\" was boycotted in many American video stations. Despite the controversy, the video was nominated for a 2003 VMA, and Luda performed it live at the awards' pre-show. Ludacris also toured with Papa Roach in 2002 after the release of their sophomore album lovehatetragedy. Ludacris reached a new level of notoriety when TV's Bill O'Reilly expressed outrage that Pepsi had hired Ludacris as a spokesman. O'Reilly repeatedly attacked Ludacris's foul language and called for a nation-wide boycott of Pepsi, who then fired Ludacris and hired Ozzy Osbourne's family instead.\n\nChicken-N-Beer\n\nDuring the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, \"Act A Fool\" from the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. At around the same time, he released the lead single from his upcoming album, Chicken & Beer, called \"P-Poppin\" (short for \"Pussy Poppin'\"). Neither of his new singles were as well-received by either the urban or pop audiences as his previous songs had been, and both music videos received only limited airplay. Chicken & Beer opened strongly, but without a popular single, the album fell quickly.\n\nHowever, in the fall of 2003, Ludacris rebounded with his next single, \"Stand Up\", which appeared on both Chicken & Beer as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip-hop/dance movie, Honey. Produced by Kanye West, \"Stand Up\" went on to become Ludacris' biggest mainstream hit to date, hitting the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, rhythmic, and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, MTV2, and BET.\n\nThe album's next single, \"Splash Waterfalls\", was released in early 2004. Though not a pop hit, it became a success at urban radio and BET. It was Ludacris' most sexual video yet and an R&B remix that featured Raphael Saadiq and sampled Tony! Toni! Tone!'s \"Whatever You Want\". Luda next released \"Blow It Out\", a gritty song that had a heavily low-budget, gritty, and urban-looking music video, which was a huge departure from the colorful, sensual, R&B leanings depicted in \"Splash Waterfalls\". \"Blow It Out\" acted both as a scathing response to the aforementioned criticism levied by Bill O'Reilly and an expression of disgust at Pepsi's cowardice in the affair:\n\nShout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'm'a throw you a curve\nYou mad cause I'm a thief and got away with words\nI'm'a start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves\nPepsi's the New Generation?\u2014Blow it out cha ass!\n\n* On 1 June 2006, a federal jury found that \"Stand Up\" did not infringe on the copyright of a song called \"Straight Like That\" by a New Jersey group known as I.O.F. \"I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame,\" Ludacris said after the verdict. \"This whole experience is proof to me of why I will always fight for what I believe in.\"\n\nThe Red Light District\n\nThe fourth studio album from Ludacris. Although entirely different from the usual antics of the previous albums, Ludacris had taken a more mature approach to his album. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat. Ludacris had recently filmed and recorded the single \"Get Back\" in which he was featured a muscle-bounded hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned his critics to leave him alone. He also was featured on Saturday Night Live playing his song Get Back with Sum 41. The follow-up single was the Austin Powers-inspired \"The Number One Spot\". It was produced by New York City's Hot 97 personality DJ Green Lantern. It used the Quincy Jones sample of \"Soul Bossa Nova\" and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris' rap flow. Ludacris also filmed the video in which he pokes fun at O'Reilly's problems with Andrea Mackris (Hi Mr. O'Reilly / Hope all is well kiss the plaintiff and the wifey). Production credits come also from veteran producers Timbaland, Lil' Jon, The Medicine Men and legendary rapper Doug E. Fresh. Featured artists on the album include Nas, DJ Quik, DMX, Trick Daddy, and Disturbing Tha Peace newcomers Bobby Valentino (of Mista fame) and Dolla Boi and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. And most recently the rapper had used his opportunity to start his own foundation. The Ludacris Foundation started by Ludacris and Chaka Zulu is an organization that helps young middle and high school students motivate themselves in creative arts. Ludacris also has a daughter by the name of Karma. Ludacris had also participated at the Super Bowl and is the spokesman for the Boost Mobile Phone ad-campaign. Ludacris also received his first Grammy Award with Usher and Lil Jon for their hit single \"Yeah\"\n\nRelease Therapy\n\nIn a recent issue of XXL, a hip-hop based magazine, Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for Release Therapy. The album Release Therapy was released on September 26, 2006. Ludacris is going to format the cd to have two sides, a Release side and a Therapy side. With the Release side having songs that allow him to get everything off his chest and the Therapy side being just feel-good music. A song titled \"War With God\" is one of the confirmed tracks from the upcoming album. The first single, \"Money Maker\", which features Pharrell, was released to U.S. radio outlets on July 17. Others songs will be : \"Tell It Like It Is\" (Produced by Elaborate Musik Workshop), \"Runaway Love\" (Feat. Mary J. Blige) and Woozy (Feat. R. Kelly)[1] \"Money Maker\" reached number one on the BET 106 & Park Countdown for the first time on September 15, 2006. The album recently reached number 1 on the Billboard 200 album charts with sales of more than 300,000 in its first week.\n\nTo promote the album, Ludacris will be hosting and performing on Saturday Night Live 18 November. Ludacris is the second and only rapper to host and perform on the same episode (MC Hammer hosted and performed in 1991, on different episodes ).\n\nTheater of the Mind\n\nLudacris's 6th album, Theater of the Mind, is to come out in 2007.\n\nActing career\n\nLudacris has been acting in film since The Wash in 2001, but his big break came in 2005, where he received critical praise for his roles in the Oscar-winning films Hustle & Flow and Crash. Crash includes an ironic sequence where Ludacris's character is dismissive of hip-hop music. Interestingly, in both films, he is physically beaten by characters played by Terrence Howard. He is occasionally credited as \"Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges\".\n\nOn January 29, 2006 he was awarded with a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture for his work in the film Crash. Ludacris also starred in 2 Fast 2 Furious.Ludacris narrated the 2006 Ward Serrill basketball documentary \"Heart of the Game.\" Ludacris recently cut his trademark braids off to project a new image for his upcoming album, Release Therapy.\n\nHe recently appeared in the 28 March 2006 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Ludacris portrayed Darius Randall, the nephew of Detective Fin Tutuola, portrayed by Ice T.\n\nDisputes\n\nFurthering the controversy, in response to the signing of the Osbourne family, popular music hip-hop mogul, Russell Simmons, organized a boycott against the company. Simmons demanded an apology from Pepsi to Ludacris and a 5 million dollar donation to one of Ludacris' charities. Eventually Simmons and Pepsi settled on an agreement to stop the boycott, right before it was to officially begin-- while Pepsi did not formally apologize to Ludacris, they did agree to donate millions of dollars over years to Russel Simmon Hip-Hop Summit Action Network.\n\nLudacris' song \"Blow It Out\" (from the Chicken & Beer album), acted as a scathing response to his critics, namely O'Reilly.\n\nIn another song, \"Hoes in My Room\", he tells a story about anonymous prostitutes being left in his room, and at the end of the last verse he says:\n\nThen it got to my head and Somethin' remind me\n\nI know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly.\n\nThen, in 2004, in \"Number 1 Spot\"\n\nRespected highly, Hi Mr. O'Reilly.\n\nHope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris criticized Oprah Winfrey about his appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. During the interview, the conversation veered from the movie and Winfrey chose to speak on Ludacris' lyrical content, which he felt was unfair as he was visiting her show in the capacity of an actor and not a rapper. Also, Ludacris was upset that some of his responses were later edited from the show's airing. He was later joined by other rappers such as 50 Cent, Ice Cube and Killer Mike who argued that Winfrey had an anti-hip hop bias.\n\nWinfrey responded by saying that she's opposed to rap lyrics that \"marginalize women,\" but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. Ludacris later said the media had blown his comments out of proportion and said he respects Winfrey and considers her \"a great individual.\"\n\nIn 2004, before the release of his debut album Straight Outta Ca$hville, Nashville, Tennessee native and G-Unit member Young Buck would enlist the services of fellow Atlanta emcee T.I., also known as T.I.P. in his native Bankhead neighborhood of westside Atlanta. They would create a track entitled \"Stomp\" amid growing tension between Buck's good friend Ludacris and T.I. On the track, T.I. takes subliminal shots at Ludacris including the line \"me gettin' beat down, that's ludicrous.\" Buck, immediately sensing the tension, decided before releasing the track to notify Ludacris that T.I. had mentioned him since he didn't want to position himself as encouraging T.I.'s actions. Ludacris hears the track and asks Buck if he can add his own verse to which Buck agrees. The results end up being costly for T.I. as he is berated throughout Ludacris' verse and called out by name in his last line. Representatives from T.I. notify Buck that T.I.'s vocals will not be cleared for the album unless T.I. is allowed to change his verse, and also have Ludacris change his. Buck refuses this offer and T.I. prohibits his vocals from being used. Buck has hypeman and fellow rapper D-Tay replace T.I. on the song and D-Tay himself is eventually replaced by The Game on the official release.\n\nAlthough T.I. was removed, the street cut featuring him and Ludacris had already been leaked to DJs in Atlanta and New York. T.I. was unable to stop the track's distribution throughout the streets of the nation at this point. It is widely accepted that T.I. \"lost\" this battle with Ludacris easily being the victor. The beef between Ludacris and T.I. was then put to an end behind closed doors as T.I. said that the problems between them have ceased.\n\nIn 2006 however, T.I. would release his highly anticipated fourth solo album entitled KING. In his Just Blaze produced track titled \"I'm Talkin To You,\" T.I. lyrically attacks one or more unknown targets who have widely been speculated to be either Ludacris, New Orleans emcee Lil Wayne, or Houston rapper Lil' Flip (whom T.I. also had beef with but has since ended their animosity behind closed doors) or a combination of all three. It is still unknown whether or not T.I. was in fact battling Ludacris again or anyone else for that matter at all. A closer listen to the song, however proves that T.I. isnt dissing Ludacris. In one of T.I.s lines he quotes \"had it out with 'Cris, but he still my nigga...sat down civilized talked about it like niggas\", alluding to the sit down that he and Ludacris had to end their beef. As a matter of fact during the taping of MTV's My Block 'Atlanta', T.I. and Ludacris are shown greeting each other respectfully.\n\nIn July of 2006, a track entitled \"War with God\" would see Ludacris return after some time off in movies. In the track, Ludacris goes on the offensive against an unknown rapper who has sold drugs, and makes repeated references to shooting guns in his songs, isn't as rich as he (Ludacris) and likes to give himself titles - all very well known characteristics and facts directly relating to T.I and Young Jeezy (or countless other less popular rappers) or the newcoming rappers Yung Joc and Young Dro. In this instance it also unknown whether or not Ludacris is indeed aiming his disses at Young Jeezy, T.I. or if the track is even a song recorded recently. Ludacris recently stated that the song was deeper than just a diss, and the song is more about him than anyone else, it's showing that he isn't just the 'cartoon entertainer' type rapper that he has always been portrayed as, when asked about who specific rhymes were aimed at he said \"The guilty will speak\". The track has been confirmed to be a selection from Ludacris' upcoming album Release Therapy this September. The song is not aimed at Young Jeezy as he features on the latest album. \"War with God\" uses a beat written by Don Cheegro and Dirty Harry.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nelly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9049470.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rap, Hip-hop, Hip Hop", "Time": "10:59 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Name at birth: Cornell Haynes, Jr.\n\nNelly became a hip-hop and pop superstar after the success of his solo 2000 release, Country Grammar.

On Italian Ice, the New Jersey-bred singer/songwriter conjures the romance and danger and wild magic of a place especially close to her heart: the Jersey Shore in all its scrappy beauty. Inspired by the boardwalk\u2019s many curiosities\u2014the crumbling Victorian mansions, the legendary funhouse, the Asbury Park rock-and-roll scene she played a key part in reviving\u2014Atkins transforms her neverending fascination into a wonderland of her own making.\n\nFor help in capturing the shore\u2019s kinetic spirit, Atkins assembled a studio band whose lineup feels almost mythical. Recorded at the iconic Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama, Italian Ice finds the Nashville-based artist joined by Spooner Oldham and David Hood (both members of The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who played on classic records from the likes of Aretha Franklin and Etta James), Binky Griptite of The Dap Kings, Jim Sclavunos and Dave Sherman of The Bad Seeds, and drummer McKenzie Smith (St. Vincent, Midlake). With special guests including Spoon frontman Britt Daniel, Seth Avett of The Avett Brothers, Erin Rae, and John Paul White, the album is a testament to Atkins\u2019s uncommon talent for uniting musicians of radically different sensibilities. As Atkins explains, the abundance of collaborations on Italian Ice partly stems from a freak accident in which she stumbled into a sinkhole in a Knoxville parking lot\u2014an incident that left her with a profound longing to fill her life with the people and experiences that bring her the most joy.\n\nCo-produced by Atkins and Ben Tanner of Alabama Shakes, Italian Ice makes brilliant use of its A-list personnel, unfolding in a kaleidoscopic sound that Atkins likens to \u201can acid trip through my record collection.\u201d At turns as opulent as symphonic pop and gritty as garage punk, the album wanders into shades of psych-rock and honky-tonk and girl-group melodrama, endlessly spotlighting the tightly honed musicianship and unbridled originality at heart of Atkins\u2019s artistry.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sheryl Crow ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7560403.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A nine-time GRAMMY AWARD recipient, Sheryl Crow is an American music icon.

The core of the band is completed with Gina Rebelo on bass (formerly of Three Day Threshold) and influences from Bootsy Collins to John Paul Jones, and Peter Douskalis a skillful guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, creating the foundational surge for the listener to truly become part of the music. Using the depth of life experiences as inspiration for their lyrics, the band strive to connect with the listener through rock-and-roll infused messages of overcoming obstacles with a tinge of sorrow-filled hope. Guitar riffs, keyboards, string section, bass lines, drum rhythms and a strong emotionally-charged stage presence add to the radio-ready experience of TIS.\n\n\"We're all trying to escape the static that surrounds us,\" says Athan. \"We all seem to be trapped in some way, and the theme of our music is to find ways to break free from the things that hold you back.

Hailing from Wyckoff, New Jersey, the band consists of three brothers: Kevin Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas. They have released three albums: It's About Time (2006), Jonas Brothers (2007), and A Little Bit Longer (2008).\n\nThe band started as a solo project of Nick Jonas. When Nick was six years old, he was discovered while singing at a salon and was referred to a professional show business manager. At the age of 7, Nicholas began performing on Broadway. He has acted in several plays, including A Christmas Carol (in 2000 as Tiny Tim and Scrooge at eight), Annie Get Your Gun (in 2001 as Little Jake), Beauty and the Beast (in 2002 as Chip), and Les Mis\u00e9rables (in 2003 as Gavroche). After Les Mis\u00e9rables closed, he performed in The Sound of Music (as Kurt) at the Paper Mill Playhouse.\n\nIn 2002 while performing in Beauty and the Beast, Nick wrote a song with his father called \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\". With background vocals from the Beauty and the Beast cast, Nick performed the song on the 2002 annual Broadway \"Equity Fights AIDS\" album, Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 4. In November 2003, INO Records received a demo copy of \"Joy To The World (A Christmas Prayer)\". The label released the song to Christian radio, where it quickly became popular on Record & Radio's Christian Adult Contemporary Chart. While Nick was working on his solo project, Joe followed in his footsteps to Broadway, appearing in Baz Lurhmann's production of La Boheme.\n\nBy September 2004, an executive at Columbia Records found out about Nick's song. Nick was soon jointly signed to INO Records and Columbia Records and released the single \"Dear God\". A second single, a new solo recording of \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\", was released on November 16. It was supposed to be followed by a December release of a self-titled solo album Nicholas Jonas, but the album had been pushed back; it did, however, get a limited release. Nick, along with Kevin and Joe, had written several other songs for the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. After meeting with Nick and hearing the song, \"Please Be Mine,\" written and performed by the brothers, Daylight Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act.\n\nAfter being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers.\"\n\nThroughout 2005, the Jonas Brothers went on several tours, including being the opening act of Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five.They spent the latter portion of the year on an anti-drug tour with Aly & AJ and The Cheetah Girls. Additionally, they opened for The Veronicas in early 2006.\n\nFor the album, titled It's About Time, the band collaborated with several writers, including Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne), Michael Mangini (Joss Stone), Desmond Child (Aerosmith, Bon Jovi), Billy Mann (Destiny's Child, Jessica Simpson) and Steve Greenberg (Joss Stone, Hanson). The album was initially supposed to be released in February 2006, but was pushed back several times.The delay was due to executive changes at Sony (the parent company of Columbia) and the executives' desire to have \"another lead single\" on the album. For the album, the Jonas Brothers covered two hit songs by UK band Busted - \"Year 3000\" and \"What I Go to School For\".\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' first single, \"Mandy\", was released on December 27, 2005. Its music video was shown on MTV's Total Request Live on February 22, 2006 and reached number four. Another song, \"Time for Me to Fly,\" was released on the Aquamarine soundtrack, also in February. In March, \"Mandy\" was featured in the Nickelodeon television film Zoey 101: Spring Break-Up and the Zoey 101: Music Mix soundtrack album, with Nicholas Jonas listed as the artist name. The group's music was also featured on Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoon Fridays.The band covered \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" from Pirates of the Caribbean for the DisneyMania 4 album, released on April 4, 2006. Over the summer of 2006, the Jonas Brothers went on tour with Aly & AJ. The Jonas Brothers also created the theme song for the second season of American Dragon Jake Long, airing from June 2006 to September 2007 on the Disney Channel.\n\nIt's About Time was finally released on August 8, 2006. According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of 50,000 copies, so the album can be bid on auction sites like eBay for up to $200-$300 USD. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels.\n\nOn October 3, 2006, Nick's 2004 solo single, \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer),\" was re-released on Joy to the World: The Ultimate Christmas Collection. Also in October, the Jonas Brothers covered \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid. Along with a music video, the song was released on a two-disk special-edition release of The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The second single from It's About Time was \"Year 3000.\" The song became popular on Radio Disney, and the music video debuted on Disney Channel in January 2007.\n\nThe band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.\n\nAfter shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007. Around the same time, brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle. On March 24, two additional songs on two different albums were released: \"Kids of the Future\" from the Meet the Robinsons soundtrack (Based on Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\"), and \"I Wanna Be like You\" from DisneyMania 5.\n\nTheir self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007. It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week. Two singles with music videos were also released around this time - \"Hold On\" two weeks before, and \"S.O.S.\" just after the release of the album.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008 with CDVU+ technology, just like their last album, Jonas Brothers. On June 24, 2008, iTunes announced that it would be releasing four songs from A Little Bit Longer, one roughly every two weeks. The purchase of each of the songs will go toward the price of the entire album, and one will be able to buy it using the Complete the Album feature after the album is released. Each song will also feature a new podcast episode from the boys. The schedule: June 24, 2008 for \"Burnin' Up\"; July 15, 2008 for \"Pushin' Me Away\"; July 29, 2008 for \"Tonight\"; and August 5, 2008 for \"A Little Bit Longer.\" Now that all of the singles have been released, all of them have occupied the number 1 spot on iTunes for at least 3 days.\n\nThe band filmed a Disney Channel Original Movie called Camp Rock where they play a band called \"Connect Three.\" Joe plays the lead male role and lead singer \"Shane Gray\"; Nick plays the role of \"Nate,\" a guitarist; and Kevin plays the role of \"Jason,\" also a guitarist. A soundtrack for the movie was released on June 17, 2008. It debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 with 188,000 copies sold in its first week.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers made history being the first group ever to sell more than 100,000 digital downloads for three consecutive singles: \"Burnin' Up\", 183,000+ first week sales, \"Play My Music\", 109,000+ sales, and \"Pushin' Me Away\", 116,000+ sales. In addition, \"Burnin' Up\", \"Pushin' Me Away\", and \"Tonight\" all charted as #1 on the iTunes \"Top Songs\" Chart for several days, pushing off Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\", which had been charting for weeks on #1 already.", "otherInfo": "Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dryes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9957553.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Alt-country, Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The first time the public got a taste of country duo The Dryes was in May 2018.

It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Nights Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Austin Haynes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10190259.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Rock, Alternative, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Austin Haynes is an AlternatIve/ Folk artist from Texas.

We have created much of our own sound by taking bits and pieces of every genre we love and smashed it together to make what is our sound today! We have been told we sound like a mash up of Lamb of God, Slayer ,Black Label Society, Slipknot and now even some Killswitch! Taking the heavier edge, we love and bringing back the mind numbing solos from the past. Nothing beats thunderous drums, heavy vocals, killer bass riffs and a screaming lead guitar!!! Time to get rid of the cookie cutter bands and music and get back to our roots kicking ass! We pride ourselves in being able to please every fan no matter what genre you are into we have something for you!!! So sit back relax and prepare for you mind to be melted!\n\nDead Reckoning\u2122 was formed by Mike K-OS Spriggs originally from Albuquerque NM, at the time an active duty soldier stationed at Fort Benning GA in the spring of 2012 with the goal to mix old and new metal elements to create something powerful, lasting and unique. He began to build a foundation from bands like Slayer, Lamb Of God, Children of Bodom, BLS, Pantera and many others to create what has become the Dead Reckoning\u2122 Sound. Ryan Lake has taken over on Drums to bring true clarity and power to the rhythm section with fast pummeling rolls and dynamic foot work. On Bass, Brian Silverstein is now holding down the low end with a bass finger style reminiscent of Iron Maiden and early Metallica with his killer sound. New vocalist Curt Esparza was once the bassist for us and found himself down a different path but once he heard we were looking for a new singer he quickly made his way back. Within days of tryouts he was signed to the band with a very unique sounding range of screams, growls and even cleans bringing us to a new level for upcoming albums. Dead Reckoning\u2122 now stands ready to make their charge down the path of world domination, now as a national touring band looking to reset the world's mind on metal and get back to our ass kicking roots.

Hailing from Wyckoff, New Jersey, the band consists of three brothers: Kevin Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas. They have released three albums: It's About Time (2006), Jonas Brothers (2007), and A Little Bit Longer (2008).\n\nThe band started as a solo project of Nick Jonas. When Nick was six years old, he was discovered while singing at a salon and was referred to a professional show business manager. At the age of 7, Nicholas began performing on Broadway. He has acted in several plays, including A Christmas Carol (in 2000 as Tiny Tim and Scrooge at eight), Annie Get Your Gun (in 2001 as Little Jake), Beauty and the Beast (in 2002 as Chip), and Les Mis\u00e9rables (in 2003 as Gavroche). After Les Mis\u00e9rables closed, he performed in The Sound of Music (as Kurt) at the Paper Mill Playhouse.\n\nIn 2002 while performing in Beauty and the Beast, Nick wrote a song with his father called \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\". With background vocals from the Beauty and the Beast cast, Nick performed the song on the 2002 annual Broadway \"Equity Fights AIDS\" album, Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 4. In November 2003, INO Records received a demo copy of \"Joy To The World (A Christmas Prayer)\". The label released the song to Christian radio, where it quickly became popular on Record & Radio's Christian Adult Contemporary Chart. While Nick was working on his solo project, Joe followed in his footsteps to Broadway, appearing in Baz Lurhmann's production of La Boheme.\n\nBy September 2004, an executive at Columbia Records found out about Nick's song. Nick was soon jointly signed to INO Records and Columbia Records and released the single \"Dear God\". A second single, a new solo recording of \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\", was released on November 16. It was supposed to be followed by a December release of a self-titled solo album Nicholas Jonas, but the album had been pushed back; it did, however, get a limited release. Nick, along with Kevin and Joe, had written several other songs for the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. After meeting with Nick and hearing the song, \"Please Be Mine,\" written and performed by the brothers, Daylight Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act.\n\nAfter being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers.\"\n\nThroughout 2005, the Jonas Brothers went on several tours, including being the opening act of Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five.They spent the latter portion of the year on an anti-drug tour with Aly & AJ and The Cheetah Girls. Additionally, they opened for The Veronicas in early 2006.\n\nFor the album, titled It's About Time, the band collaborated with several writers, including Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne), Michael Mangini (Joss Stone), Desmond Child (Aerosmith, Bon Jovi), Billy Mann (Destiny's Child, Jessica Simpson) and Steve Greenberg (Joss Stone, Hanson). The album was initially supposed to be released in February 2006, but was pushed back several times.The delay was due to executive changes at Sony (the parent company of Columbia) and the executives' desire to have \"another lead single\" on the album. For the album, the Jonas Brothers covered two hit songs by UK band Busted - \"Year 3000\" and \"What I Go to School For\".\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' first single, \"Mandy\", was released on December 27, 2005. Its music video was shown on MTV's Total Request Live on February 22, 2006 and reached number four. Another song, \"Time for Me to Fly,\" was released on the Aquamarine soundtrack, also in February. In March, \"Mandy\" was featured in the Nickelodeon television film Zoey 101: Spring Break-Up and the Zoey 101: Music Mix soundtrack album, with Nicholas Jonas listed as the artist name. The group's music was also featured on Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoon Fridays.The band covered \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" from Pirates of the Caribbean for the DisneyMania 4 album, released on April 4, 2006. Over the summer of 2006, the Jonas Brothers went on tour with Aly & AJ. The Jonas Brothers also created the theme song for the second season of American Dragon Jake Long, airing from June 2006 to September 2007 on the Disney Channel.\n\nIt's About Time was finally released on August 8, 2006. According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of 50,000 copies, so the album can be bid on auction sites like eBay for up to $200-$300 USD. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels.\n\nOn October 3, 2006, Nick's 2004 solo single, \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer),\" was re-released on Joy to the World: The Ultimate Christmas Collection. Also in October, the Jonas Brothers covered \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid. Along with a music video, the song was released on a two-disk special-edition release of The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The second single from It's About Time was \"Year 3000.\" The song became popular on Radio Disney, and the music video debuted on Disney Channel in January 2007.\n\nThe band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.\n\nAfter shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007. Around the same time, brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle. On March 24, two additional songs on two different albums were released: \"Kids of the Future\" from the Meet the Robinsons soundtrack (Based on Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\"), and \"I Wanna Be like You\" from DisneyMania 5.\n\nTheir self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007. It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week. Two singles with music videos were also released around this time - \"Hold On\" two weeks before, and \"S.O.S.\" just after the release of the album.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008 with CDVU+ technology, just like their last album, Jonas Brothers. On June 24, 2008, iTunes announced that it would be releasing four songs from A Little Bit Longer, one roughly every two weeks. The purchase of each of the songs will go toward the price of the entire album, and one will be able to buy it using the Complete the Album feature after the album is released. Each song will also feature a new podcast episode from the boys. The schedule: June 24, 2008 for \"Burnin' Up\"; July 15, 2008 for \"Pushin' Me Away\"; July 29, 2008 for \"Tonight\"; and August 5, 2008 for \"A Little Bit Longer.\" Now that all of the singles have been released, all of them have occupied the number 1 spot on iTunes for at least 3 days.\n\nThe band filmed a Disney Channel Original Movie called Camp Rock where they play a band called \"Connect Three.\" Joe plays the lead male role and lead singer \"Shane Gray\"; Nick plays the role of \"Nate,\" a guitarist; and Kevin plays the role of \"Jason,\" also a guitarist. A soundtrack for the movie was released on June 17, 2008. It debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 with 188,000 copies sold in its first week.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers made history being the first group ever to sell more than 100,000 digital downloads for three consecutive singles: \"Burnin' Up\", 183,000+ first week sales, \"Play My Music\", 109,000+ sales, and \"Pushin' Me Away\", 116,000+ sales. In addition, \"Burnin' Up\", \"Pushin' Me Away\", and \"Tonight\" all charted as #1 on the iTunes \"Top Songs\" Chart for several days, pushing off Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\", which had been charting for weeks on #1 already.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ MADD\u00d8G ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10282312.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Electro House, Electronic, House, Techno", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "MADD\u00d8G has shared lineups with such artists as Ke$ha, Betty Who, Big Freedia, Matt & Kim, Girl Talk, and Big Dipper to name a few.

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Disco Biscuits ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8206122.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Jamband, Electronica, Electronic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Comprised of Jon Gutwillig (vocals/guitar), Marc Brownstein (vocals/bass), Aron Magner (keyboard/vocals), and Allen Aucoin (drums), the quartet continues to bridge the gap between the jamband and electronica/dance worlds by drawing on elements from seemingly disparate genres. This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee.

With no two shows ever the same, word of mouth has quickly grown a ravenous fanbase eager to hear their favorite studio tracks explored and extended as part of a live community. As seasoned KSC fans can tell you, any one of their songs could easily turn from a fun sing-along, into a cacophonous headbanging garage-rock soundscape, to a Klezmer-disco dance party, and then resolve into a peaceful ambient meditation that evokes the nostalgia of your childhood.\n\nAveraging over 100 shows per year since 2013, the band is currently comprised of Louis Smith [Acoustic guitar, vocals], Brian Roy [Bass, vocals], Ryan Wood [Drums], Ben Laderberg [Electric guitar], and Jake Vanaman [Saxophone]. For such a young band, their accomplishments are sincere. Kendall Street has performed at festivals such as Lockn\u2019, Roosterwalk, Floydfest, Resonance, and Domefest and has opened for acts such as Papadosio, Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Tauk, and Leftover Salmon. All the while, the band has proudly released three records and two EPs. Their most recent 2019 release, \u201cLunar Dude\u201d showcases their versatility and virtuosity, and was met with overwhelming support.\n\n2020 is building up to be the biggest year yet for the band. Along with two (or perhaps three) new records on the horizon, their upcoming Winter/Spring tour will take them all across the country in Woody Guthrie fashion. From Louisiana to Texas, Colorado to Wisconsin, Ohio to Boston, New York City and more, the band has no intent of slowing down any time soon.

An acoustic re-imagining of the songs from the rock record, the tracks are presented in stark, stripped-down contrast to its predecessors.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Hell of a Time... is a Saturday night record,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThis version is for the hangover on Sunday.\u201d\n\nRe-contextualizing the songs offers a new window into the lyrics. What he once described as a \u201cparty-rock record for the brokenhearted\u201d transforms into a reflective and beautiful dive into false escapism, grief, love, and loss. \"The stripped-down record lends clarity and depth to his already nuanced lyrics, revealing a deep thinker who seeks honesty in his craft, and in life.\" - Beatroute\n\nThe recording came amidst a particularly busy time for Matt Mays. During a period when he headlined his first Massey Hall concert and supported sold out shows with The Gaslight Anthem all over North America, Matt teamed up with co-producer Eric Ratz to record at studios around Toronto between touring commitments.\n\nTwice Upon a Hell of a Time\u2026 was originally conceived as a straight-up solo interpretation, similar to the iTunes Session recorded with Ratz in 2011. As the songs took shape, however, Matt decided to incorporate extra vocals and instrumentation. Tapping musicians Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Lee Harvey Osmond) on pedal steel, Anthony Carone (Arkells) on piano, and guest singers Andrew Rodriguez, Kate Dyke, and Melissa Payne, the album\u2019s arrangements are lush and large without straying from the \u2018unplugged\u2019 vibe he sought from the outset.\n\nLead track \u201cOla Volo\u201d is inspired by a Vancouver-based mural artist of the same name who also created the original album art for both records. \u201cHer paintings and drawings all have a theme that I picked up on,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature. To me, it\u2019s from another dimension, a very curious dimension that draws me in. Her pieces are very edgy and real-life at the same time. I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance).

It\u2019s a formula that quickly took them from local favorites, playing around Annapolis, to a national stage. With a wildly infectious sound, tattoo-worthy lyrics and an itch to take their music to the masses, the band piled into the van years ago and have rarely seen home since.\n\nThe Bumpin Uglies\u2019 origin story begins with singer/guitarist Brandon Hardesty playing open mics around Maryland. He met bassist Dave Wolf not too long after and Bumpin Uglies was born. With a proper set of wheels and TJ Haslett on drums, they went off to spread their music across the country like modern day Johnny Appleseeds. The group recently added Chad Wright on keyboards, expanding on their sound.\nRaised on everything from Bad Religion and The Beach Boys to Sublime and Reel Big Fish, Bumpin Uglies have managed to take inspiration from some of the best out there, run it through their own distinctive filter and end up with a truly original take on the various genres creating an original hybrid. With a unique sound that\u2019s nearly impossible to ignore, the band has gotten everyone from dreadlocked kids to PBR-fueled tattooed punks moving their heads to their music at festivals and on headlining tours across the country.\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t on the road, they\u2019ve been camped in the studio, churning out three full lengths, two EPs and a live record. Their latest, 2016\u2019s Keep It Together came out on Right Coast Records and is proof that the band has found their groove. The album consists of a dozen stand-out tracks, any one of which could be considered instant classics for the band.

It\u2019s a journey that has seen the country-rocker tour with superstars like Taylor Swift and Alan Jackson, play to over 50,000 people in Nashville at the world\u2019s biggest country music festival and build a large, devoted following as he\u2019s played the length and breadth of his native land and across the USA. Morgan has made his mark on the Australian musical landscape with a sound that fused contemporary country with melodic rock, fueled by a unique passion and energy all Morgan\u2019s own. His music is driven by an optimism shaped by life\u2019s bumpy journey, a faith in the power of love and hard work to overcome the obstacles we all face every day. Growing up in the working class beach city of Newcastle in NSW, Morgan turned the blue-collar ethic of his neighborhood into a relentless drive for energy and connection in his live shows. After seeing him whip a festival crowd into a frenzy, Warner Music Australia offered Morgan a recording contract. In 2013, after releasing two hit EPs that yielded three #1 singles, Morgan was named New Oz Artist of the Year at the CMC Music Awards. The fan voted award solidified his status as the hottest young performer in Australian country and was followed by four more trophies over the next two years, including back-to-back Male Oz Artist of the Year awards. Soon Morgan returned to Nashville to record his debut album with an all-star group of A-list musicians and Nashville based Aussie ex-pat producer Jedd Hughes. \u201cTo hear guys who played on the songs that inspired me to become a musician, playing on my songs, blew my mind,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt reminded me of why I was doing this in the first place and pushed me to take my vocals and guitar playing on the album to the next level\u201d. The songs that make up Morgan Evans are the result of a relentless songwriting schedule for almost a year that took Morgan to Nashville and back, and saw him tap into the deepest parts of himself. Morgan wrote eleven of the twelve tracks - some by himself, some with local artists and many with A-list Nashville writers. The album, released in March 2014, immediately shot to #1 on the iTunes and ARIA Country Album Charts and debuted at #20 on the ARIA Mainstream Album Chart. The impact of the acclaimed album has been immense \u2013 3 #1 singles (One Eye for an Eye, Best I Never Had and record-equaling Like A Tornado) and his first APRA nominations just for starters. The release also garnered international attention, leading to an invitation to return to Nashville\u2019s massive CMA Music Festival and perform at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, which prompted William Morris Endeavor \u2013 the world\u2019s largest talent agency \u2013 to sign Morgan up for international representation. Morgan\u2019s charisma and talent for engaging audiences led to his signing as the face of Foxtel\u2019s Country Music Channel, which has already seen him nominated for an ASTRA Award and a TV Week Logie Award \u2013 a first for an Australian country music star. He hosts television coverage of the CMC Rocks music festival, artist interviews and the CMC Music Awards. He was joined in 2016 by international co-host Kelsea Ballerini for the live national broadcast. A major career milestone was capped off when Morgan received a message from Grammy-winners Lady Antebellum informing him that he\u2019d been awarded the prestigious 2015 CMA Global Artist Award. The award recognizes outstanding achievement by an international country star in furthering the popularity of country music in their home country. Morgan joins an exceptional list of previous winners including Tommy Emmanuel, Kasey Chambers and Lee Kernaghan. Since then, Morgan has his sights set once again on Nashville, relocating to Music City where he has been writing with the A-list of songwriters for his upcoming US debut release and recently made return performances to CMA Music Fest and the Grand Ole Opry. His growing fanbase in both Australia and the USA is eagerly awaiting new music from Morgan, expected to be released later this year. http://www.morganevansmusic.com \"Kiss Somebody\" Out Now: https://wmna.sh/me_kisssomebod Twitter: @Morgan_Evans Instagram: @morganevansmusic Snapchat: themorganevans", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.circleplus.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sweet Baby James ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9968067.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Acoustic, Rock, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sweet Baby James - the Music of James Taylor delivers an evening of JT music just for you... with an authenticity and sincerity that is unrivaled.

I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance).

Evidence: Before the World Was Made. The Austin-based songwriters\u2019 debut collaboration spotlights celebrated troubadours in peak form (\u201cBefore We Come to Our Senses\u201d). \u201cThese are modern day country duets \u00e0 la George Jones and Melba Montgomery,\u201d producer Gurf Morlix says, \u201cbut with very sophisticated songwriting.\u201d Before the World Was Made began taking shape three years ago right as Leigh\u2019s solo high watermark The Box stirred waves far and wide. (Lee Ann Womack, Sunny Sweeney and the Carper Family have covered her defiantly traditional country songs.) By that point, Leigh was well rooted in Austin, where she moved after growing up playing in a family band in Minnesota. \u201cI was attracted to the scene in Austin,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to learn and get better at what I do.\u201d Meanwhile, McKay fronted the regionally popular McKay Brothers (Cold Beer and Hot Tamales), a band legendary songwriter Guy Clark had been championing for years. \u201cNoel and Brennen are great songwriters,\u201d says Clark, whose new album My Favorite Picture of You contains the McKay co-write \u201cEl Coyote.\u201d \u201cAnd Brennen plays guitar like a motherfucker.\u201d Before the World Was Made proves his point. \u201cSome of these are songs that Noel had from a long time ago that we reconstructed,\u201d Leigh says, \u201cand some we wrote together recently. Writing duets is just almost like writing from one point of view and splitting it and making it make sense. Like \u2018Ball in Chain,\u2019 is not like a fight song. Same with \u2018Breaking Up and Making Up Again.\u2019 They\u2019re dysfunctional, but the characters are happy with their situation, so it\u2019s almost from one point of view.\u201d The singular duo effortlessly balances wit (\u201cLet\u2019s Don\u2019t Get Married\u201d) and whimsy (\u201cLet\u2019s Go to Lubbock on Vacation\u201d) throughout. \u201cI\u2019ve loaded up the Nomad and the tank is full of gas/We\u2019ll ride along across the High Plains fast,\u201d the latter goes. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the sweetest spot on God\u2019s creation, my pretty little turtle dove/Let\u2019s go to Lubbock on vacation.\u201d Punch line: \u201cThen we\u2019ll know we\u2019re really in love.\u201d The pair consistently doubles down with sharp snapshots charting equally unpredictable romantic byways (\u201cSalty Kisses in the Sand,\u201d \u201cGreat Big Oldsmobile\u201d). \u201cWe kind of set out to make out a record of songs that we were singing together, even if it wasn\u2019t specifically duet songs,\u201d McKay says. \u201cWe both have solo careers to think about, but we\u2019ll probably revisit this over and over and it\u2019s a nice thing we can keep doing.\u201d \u201cWe got to where people were asking us about certain songs and lumping us together in their mind,\u201d Leigh adds, \u201cso we thought we should make something to pay homage to that. Of course, people like the funny ones the best.\u201d Good reason: Only kindred spirits allow a song as wickedly waggish as \u201cBe My Ball and Chain.\u201d Priceless. Everyday conversation suggests Leigh and McKay indeed share a single mindset. The pair simply compliment each other in every way. \u201cBrennen\u2019s really great at melodies,\u201d McKay says. \u201cShe\u2019s always kicking around a melody around the house and it\u2019s great and she\u2019ll attach it to a lyric idea that\u2019s equally great. She writes characters in her songs like a novelist.\u201d \u201cNoel always has the line,\u201d Leigh counters. \u201cIt\u2019s like, How are we gonna wrap this up? How are we gonna bring it around so it makes sense? He always ties it up. He always knows.

Kendall Street has performed at festivals such as Lockn\u2019, Roosterwalk, Floydfest, Resonance, and Domefest and has opened for acts such as Papadosio, Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Tauk, and Leftover Salmon.

He invited the band to play at his festival, MerleFest, helping to launch their career. Shortly thereafter the band was hired to entertain crowds between shows at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, TN.\n\nIt\u2019s been over twenty years since these humble beginnings. The band has gone on to receive the honor of being inducted as members of the Grand Ole Opry, and have won two Grammy Awards: \u201cBest Folk Album\u201d for Remedy (2014) and \u201cBest Long Form Music Video\u201d for Big Easy Express (2013).

They\u2019ve toured with artists such as Willie Nelson & Family, Brandi Carlile, Mumford & Sons, The Lumineers, John Prine, The Avett Brothers and others. The band also took part in the historic Railroad Revival Tour, traveling from California to New Orleans on a vintage train, which was captured in the Emmet Malloy directed Grammy award-winning documentary, Big Easy Express.\n\nOld Crow Medicine Show now has six studio albums to their name, three of which were released by Nettwerk Records \u2013 O.C.M.S.

Maybe that\u2019s it. Maybe that\u2019s why some people don\u2019t like country and yet... they like him.\nThe most common question a singer will be asked is, \u201cWhen did you start singing?\u201d Buckstein has always had the same answer: \u201cWhen I found out that the chicks dig it.\u201d Sounds like a punchline but it\u2019s actually the truth.\nHe was 13, at summer camp, trying to figure out how to meet girls like everyone else. A couple of girls were singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and he shyly scooted up next to them and started singing along. \u201cWhen they found out I could sing they immediately introduced me to all the other girls in the camp,\u201d he grins. \u201cI\u2019ve been singing ever since.\u201d\nHis love of country music is thanks to his father who played it all the time when he was young even though he hated the genre. \u201cIt takes one good country song to hook ya!\u201d Buckstein warns. \u201cMine was probably \u2018Thunder Rolls\u2019 by Garth Brooks or \u2018This Ain\u2019t No Thinking Thing\u2019 by Trace Adkins. I heard those tunes when I was about 11 or 12 and something just clicked\u2014I was hooked.\u201d\nHe continued to grow up a country boy at heart often retreating to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. However, since he always lived in the city, the rest of his musical tastes fall outside of the expected box, running a gamut that includes blues, rock, rap, classics from the \u201950s, and whatever was on Top 40 radio at any given time.\nBuckstein studied theater in college, earning his BA from California State University, Fullerton. Prior to \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d he had moved to LA to pursue a career as an actor. \u201cBig surprise, it wasn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d he confides. \u201cOne day a few friends of mine went to the \u2018American Idol\u2019 auditions, which was the hottest show on TV at the time. They wanted some company so I went along. I got through and they didn\u2019t. It was Idol that set me on a different path.\u201d After appearing on the finale of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d in Season 5, he returned to Denver with music on the brain.\nHe started singing with whomever would back him up, growing along the way, learning his craft, year after year, little by little, making friends, music, mistakes, and big moves, all leading him to today. \u201cThose years were invaluable,\u201d he says. \u201cThey call it \u2018paying your dues.\u2019 It always sounded like a bad thing. But I found out paying your dues can be some of the most fun you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years Buckstein has traveled all over Colorado and the Midwest region performing for soon-to-be-lifelong fans. He admits to laughing to himself when other performers come to Colorado and complain about how hard it is to sing at such a high altitude. Buckstein, being a true native of the 5280 state, has never had a problem.\n\nWith the help of his band, \u201cThe Heard\u201d (his rotating roster of professionals), he has rocked crowds opening for Charlie Daniels, Dustin Lynch, Old Dominion, Eli Young, John Michael Montgomery, Mark Chesnutt, Vanilla Ice, and many, many others. He\u2019s gained local fame as a regular guest star on Denver\u2019s hottest country station 98.5 KYGO and also as the writer and performer of \u201cThe Grizzly Rose,\u201d which is a popular song about the famous Denver nightclub, and he produced a music video for the track. Buckstein wrote the song about his personal experiences after his first week playing at the legendary venue.\n\nHe began, as most do, singing covers of all of the artists he was most influenced by. Buckstein embraces covers and thinks that no matter what, \u201cthere should always be room in your set to pay homage to the artists and songs that have touched your life. Even when you\u2019re selling out arenas with your own stuff you can do that. I have a saying: \u2018Today we play the songs that others have written\u2026 so that someday we may play the songs that we have written\u2026 so that someday others may play the songs that we have written.\u2019 You gotta put those pauses in there for dramatic effect,\u201d he laughs.\n\nBuckstein is currently embarking on his next chapter with his newest EP, Country Side. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of heart in these five tunes,\u201d Buckstein says. \u201cMaking them has been a very valuable experience. It has shown me not only where I am but where I want to go from here.\u201d\n\nBuckstein\u2019s goal is to bring soul to everything he does. \u201cWhat people seem to respond most to in my live performances is my passion, so I worked hard to bring that passion to the record. My sound gets compared a lot to the great bass-baritones of my time: Trace Adkins, Toby Keith, Josh Turner, and Chris Young. But I personally hate comparisons. I don\u2019t think Josh Turner wants to hear he sounds like Don Williams,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI just wanna sound like me. If my sound were a drink, I'd like to think it would come in a bottle with a cork instead of a twist cap. And I'd like to say it's got a crisp bite with a smooth finish.\u201d\n\nHe gives all the thanks in the world to his fans and his crew: \u201cWithout the people who support me, on stage and off, this would all be for nothing.

Her new music is the beauty created beneath the destruction.\n\nRaised in a small town in south-central Wisconsin, Madison was an anomaly in her little city. She started sneaking into rural dive bars at the age of 15 to play cover music for patrons until 2 am, paid only in pizza & tips. She spent the next seven years building a following in the Midwest, gigging in restaurants, around the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, clubs, bars, banquet halls, four to six times a week just to pay the bills & get her voice heard.\n\nAfter seven years of performing other people\u2019s music, Madison felt inclined to evolve and write about her own troubadour experiences. To pursue this neon journey of self-discovery, Madison moved to Los Angeles in late 2016. When Madison first arrived in Los Angeles, she began writing songs for artists at Sony Music, creating music for commercials at Barking Owl in Santa Monica, and landing featuring slots on high-profile artists' tracks (Anthony Federov [American Idol], Leonell Cassio, Raye Zaragoza, APZE, Mic Kellogg). She also began making a name for herself as a songwriter at the world famous, Hotel Caf\u00e9, after selling out both stages and opening for artists like Kaleo, Wrabel, Rozzi Crane, Vincint, Lucy Rose Parton, Ari Herstand, & Tall Heights. Through all of these experiences, Madison was developing her personal artistry.\n\nCurrently, Madison is in the studio working on a new EP. It is produced by Justin Glasco (Ron Pope, Christina Perri, The Lone Bellow), mixed by Bryan Cook (U2, OneRepublic, Radiohead, Delta Rae) and mastered by Grammy-award winning, Hans DeKline (U2, Diplo, Pixies).\n\nMadison Malone has written for artists at Sony Music, Warner and more as well as performed at some of the world's largest music festivals including SXSW and SUMMERFEST, where she was voted \u2018Favorite Emerging Artist\u2019. The singer-songwriter performs across the country selling out high-profile venues in cities including Los Angeles, and New York City. She also recently headlined a European tour expanding her fan base world wide. Madison Malone is continuing the next chapter of her musical endeavor with her feet planted and her voice directed toward connecting us all. \u2018Quiet Down 2\u2019 & music video are due for release summer 2019.\n\nMadison Malone intends for her music to be the saving grace in times of distress.

Some songs speak to her directly and muse on the experience of fatherhood, while others reflect on a personal experience that has a lesson or a moral. Pope's 2017 release, the critically-claimed \"Work\" drew comparisons to Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen, while also refusing to put him squarely into one category. Uncompromising and relentless, Pope has evolved into one of the top grossing independent acts in the business while garnering a legion of devoted fans the world over.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "Live from Cordovas HQ: Facebook and Instagram Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Hitman Blues Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8672039.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Galactic ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8997515.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Funk & Electronic Soul Music, Funk", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New Album \"INTO THE DEEP\" out NOW!\nhttp://tinyurl.com/zdk5ty7", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lady Antebellum ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9405569.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "This vocal trio slammed into the Country Music scene with their self-titled debut CD on April 15, 2008.

Marsden combines influences of Neil Young, John Frusciante, Alice in Chains, and Pink Floyd to create his own take on 90\u2019s era acoustic guitar based grunge rock. Marsden first garnered attention in 2016 as one of the top 3 finalists in 105.5 Triple M\u2019s Project M Singer Songwriter Competition with his intricate guitar playing, powerful vocals, and passionate performances. Over the next year, Marsden took this momentum and successfully crowd-funded his debut outer space concept album, \u201cGravity\u201d.\n\nDescribed as \u201ca beautifully dark adventure away from earth\u201d, the creative process of \u201cGravity\u201d was carefully thought out and executed. Marsden\u2019s goal was to use guitar tones, song moods, selective vocabulary, and emotional delivery in the new spacey acoustic rock songs he was writing to tell a story arc of an adventure through the stars. J. Marsden managed to crowd-fund over $3000 to help pay for the necessary production costs to do justice to his vision of Gravity. Marsden, a professional audio engineer for over 10 years, did much of the recording and producing himself but chose to hire talented mix and master engineers to take \u201cGravity\u201d to a higher level than he could on his own. \u201cGravity\u201d was released in August 2017 with an excellent reception to its concept. Mike Huberty of Maximum Ink writes, \u201cPlenty of technical skill, a great sense of melody, and most importantly a surplus of heart\u2026 Listening to the whole thing in a sitting, there\u2019s no question that Marsden\u2019s Gravity is a clear statement of mood and genre.\u201d Rick Tvedt of Local Sounds typed, \u201cMarsden\u2019s music is for the thoughtful listener, has an artistic integrity, and is expertly crafted, exploring existential topics that are laced with love, loss, and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWanting to have a platform to meet and showcase local solo artists, J. Marsden has hosted quarterly singer songwriter nights at The Frequency. He\u2019s also been an active participant in the local singer songwriter circle events where he enjoys the intimate attentive atmosphere and the camaraderie between writers. Marsden believes that music is meant to connect people to one another and to themselves, and he strives to use his own (sometimes very personal) experiences to tell stories that the listener can truly connect with on their own level.\n\nLong before his solo career J. Marsden had many diverse musical experiences, playing a variety of genres in multiple bands and one-off acts. Oldies and 90\u2019s pop radio primed Marsden\u2019s interest in music at age 6. However playing the trumpet in the 5th grade was the first time he fell in love with being a musician, and he became thoroughly involved in anything band related. At the beginning of his teenage years, Marsden picked up playing the guitar and started his first garage band, Blue Furnace. Their strange classic rock/jam/n\u00fc metal sound morphed into a funk metal band called Wall Of Funk where Marsden first got excited about band management and the music business. Over the next six years, he carried the band through one hunderd live shows, a full length album and an EP, seven Christmas songs, and tribute shows as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Deftones. During this time, J. Marsden also established himself in the local music scene by joining the popular party punk/ska band, 4 Aspirin Morning, and playing in several pop-up custom cover set wedding bands and an Offspring tribute band.\n\nJ. Marsden is currently performing throughout the Midwest in support of \u201cGravity\u201d and is writing material for his next acoustic rock adventure. He is always stashing song ideas in his back pocket and plans on also diving into new genres with ideas ranging from progressive metal to ambient relaxation music. Original and cover song videos are also on the horizon as well as a small west coast tour this summer. Marsden is available for booking private events, festivals, listening rooms, weddings, and guitar or songwriting clinics and lessons.", "otherInfo": "Join J.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

Musically it features a horn section and extended guitar solos. The lead off track, \"Still My Girl\" tells a relatable story of finding a significant others flaws and imperfections to be what you love most about them. The title track is the story of a troubadour who travels around working odd jobs and various 9-5's in an attempt to follow societal norms. \"Feel Like Gold\" is a polite jab at today's society. \"If we stick to hate, then all that's left to do is wait and see.\"\n\nAndy says about his new EP, \"Perhaps for the first time in my life I do feel a sense of fulfillment. Life is good. I've met the right lady, I go for long runs in the morning, I'm constantly inspired by my job. I enjoy myself. What gives me wicked dreams is not achieving my career goals. When I was 17, I promised myself that by 30 I'd be headlining 500 cap rooms and playing stages like the Telluride Blues & Brews Festival and eTown. Perhaps my goals were ignorant statements at the time, but I'm 28 (quickly approaching 29) and I'm nowhere near where I want to be. Yes, I'm thankful for what I have! Yes, I'm happy! But there's a lot of work to do. I'm far from satisfied.\"\n\nAndy has had the opportunity to open up for artists such as: Chase Rice, Koe Wetzel, Dick Dale, Brett Dennen, Anders Osborne, Tab Benoit, Shane Smith & The Saints, Delbert McClinton, Samantha Fish, and Chuck Prophet. His 2018 release, Reasons for Departure, brought positive reviews from press outlets including Pens Eye View and No Depression. It was also nominated for an LA Music Critic Award and two Colorado Playlist Best of Awards.\n\nWhen Andy isn\u2019t touring the US and Canada, he spends his time talking to other creatives and professionals in the music industry on his podcast, Middle Class Rock Star.", "otherInfo": "EP RELEASE SHOW!

Marsden combines influences of Neil Young, John Frusciante, Alice in Chains, and Pink Floyd to create his own take on 90\u2019s era acoustic guitar based grunge rock. Marsden first garnered attention in 2016 as one of the top 3 finalists in 105.5 Triple M\u2019s Project M Singer Songwriter Competition with his intricate guitar playing, powerful vocals, and passionate performances. Over the next year, Marsden took this momentum and successfully crowd-funded his debut outer space concept album, \u201cGravity\u201d.\n\nDescribed as \u201ca beautifully dark adventure away from earth\u201d, the creative process of \u201cGravity\u201d was carefully thought out and executed. Marsden\u2019s goal was to use guitar tones, song moods, selective vocabulary, and emotional delivery in the new spacey acoustic rock songs he was writing to tell a story arc of an adventure through the stars. J. Marsden managed to crowd-fund over $3000 to help pay for the necessary production costs to do justice to his vision of Gravity. Marsden, a professional audio engineer for over 10 years, did much of the recording and producing himself but chose to hire talented mix and master engineers to take \u201cGravity\u201d to a higher level than he could on his own. \u201cGravity\u201d was released in August 2017 with an excellent reception to its concept. Mike Huberty of Maximum Ink writes, \u201cPlenty of technical skill, a great sense of melody, and most importantly a surplus of heart\u2026 Listening to the whole thing in a sitting, there\u2019s no question that Marsden\u2019s Gravity is a clear statement of mood and genre.\u201d Rick Tvedt of Local Sounds typed, \u201cMarsden\u2019s music is for the thoughtful listener, has an artistic integrity, and is expertly crafted, exploring existential topics that are laced with love, loss, and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWanting to have a platform to meet and showcase local solo artists, J. Marsden has hosted quarterly singer songwriter nights at The Frequency. He\u2019s also been an active participant in the local singer songwriter circle events where he enjoys the intimate attentive atmosphere and the camaraderie between writers. Marsden believes that music is meant to connect people to one another and to themselves, and he strives to use his own (sometimes very personal) experiences to tell stories that the listener can truly connect with on their own level.\n\nLong before his solo career J. Marsden had many diverse musical experiences, playing a variety of genres in multiple bands and one-off acts. Oldies and 90\u2019s pop radio primed Marsden\u2019s interest in music at age 6. However playing the trumpet in the 5th grade was the first time he fell in love with being a musician, and he became thoroughly involved in anything band related. At the beginning of his teenage years, Marsden picked up playing the guitar and started his first garage band, Blue Furnace. Their strange classic rock/jam/n\u00fc metal sound morphed into a funk metal band called Wall Of Funk where Marsden first got excited about band management and the music business. Over the next six years, he carried the band through one hunderd live shows, a full length album and an EP, seven Christmas songs, and tribute shows as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Deftones. During this time, J. Marsden also established himself in the local music scene by joining the popular party punk/ska band, 4 Aspirin Morning, and playing in several pop-up custom cover set wedding bands and an Offspring tribute band.\n\nJ. Marsden is currently performing throughout the Midwest in support of \u201cGravity\u201d and is writing material for his next acoustic rock adventure. He is always stashing song ideas in his back pocket and plans on also diving into new genres with ideas ranging from progressive metal to ambient relaxation music. Original and cover song videos are also on the horizon as well as a small west coast tour this summer. Marsden is available for booking private events, festivals, listening rooms, weddings, and guitar or songwriting clinics and lessons.", "otherInfo": "Join J.

The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\".

Pursuing every avenue she came across from the glam rock of Bowie and T Rex, the showmanship of Elvis, the soul music of Aretha to the singer-songwriters of Joni Mitchell et al. Tina honed her skills, writing songs and playing every bar, club and festival that would have her.\n\nEndless touring helped her cultivate not only a dedicated following but a distinctive, blues driven and raspingly passionate vocal style reminiscent of Janis Joplin. She released several albums on her own label Movement Records with the B-Sides and soon signed a major record deal with Sire Records in 1996.\n\nThe band released two CD\u2019s for Sire, \u201cSalvation\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s All Just The Same\u201d, with their songs featured in commercials and major movie soundtracks such as \u2018The Traveller\u2019, \u2018Very Bad Things\u2019, and \u2018A Simple Plan\u2019.

During that time, Tina was even asked to play the role of Janis Joplin in Paramount\u2019s \u201cPiece of My Heart\u201d a film about the late singer\u2019s life.\n\nIn 1999, and after heavy touring and sale of Sire to Elektra, the band decided to go on hiatus indefinitely. To commemorate their 10 plus years of hard work, they played 2 sold out nights at the legendary First Ave and released a double live CD of the event, \u201cThe Last Polka\u201d which was the last release for the B-Sides.\n\nSchlieske moved permanently to California to bring up her family while continuing to travel the country doing solo acoustic shows.\n\nShe formed and played with several other bands, Lola and the Red Hots (now Lola and the Red Family Band), Tina\u2019s Elvis and most recently California-based, Tina Schlieske and the Graceland Exiles.\n\nAlso during that time Double Trouble (Stevie Ray Vaughn\u2019s band) asked her to tour singing lead and playing rhythm guitar in support of their 2001 album \u201cBeen A Long Time\u201d. She garnered rave reviews as the bands front woman touring that summer in the States and Canada with popular blues artist Kenny Wayne Sheppard.\n\nIn 2005 Tina released her first solo album produced by Sheldon Gomberg, \u201cSlow Burn\u201d which features such renowned musicians as Don Heffington (Dylan, Emmy Lou Harris), Benmont Tench (Tom Petty), Marc Ford (The Black Crows) and Rami Jaffe (The Wallflowers). To her enduring thrill, she even had Elvis Presley\u2019s guitarist James Burton play on two of the tracks.\n\nIn 2008 Schlieske released \u2018Evil Gal Blues\u2019, (also produced by Gomberg) an homage to her favorite female blues singers.

It\u2019s an out reach after school program for at-risk teens in the community, teaching self esteem and expression through music. Schlieske acts as musical director for the teens as well as a mentor. She has also donated her time teaching songwriting in her son\u2019s elementary school in which they wrote songs about all the subjects they were learning. They even got to go into a studio to record their songs and release it on a CD.\n\nMusic is Tina\u2019s lifeblood and she still goes back and forth playing in her different bands in Minnesota as well as in California, with friends, musicians and colleagues \u201cI just love music and need to play it whenever, where ever and with who ever I can!\u201d\n\nNext up for Tina is the release of \u201cPinned Up\u201d, an EP of cover songs by various Minneapolis artists from her band One Of The Boys as well as the release of \u2018Sweet Relief III\u2019 on Vanguard Records on July 9th.
