That 2008 release, with its gorgeously melodic writing and improvising and deft use of indie-rock, electronica and hip-hop elements, established Parks as one of the most gifted and original young voices in jazz. \u201cThis is the natural successor to that record,\u201d says the New York-based artist, 34. \u201cIt\u2019s taking the ideas of that project and doubling down on them\u2014fully committing to that direction.\u201d\n\nLittle Big also marks the recorded debut of the intuitive working group that gives the album its title (and which takes its name from a fantastical novel by John Crowley\u2014a favorite book of Parks and, the pianist notes, Wayne Shorter). Parks handled the production duties, with engineering by Daniel Schlett (whose credits include The War on Drugs and Ghostface Killah). The album was mixed by both Schlett and Grizzly Bear bassist/producer Chris Taylor, the latter of whom Parks met in a Seattle big band at the age of 10. \u201cWe put a lot of time and care into the way this record sounds, and the result\u201d\u2014simultaneously crystalline and warm, postmodern and natural\u2014\u201cmakes me really happy,\u201d Parks adds.\n\nAfter experimenting with various lineups and sessions, Parks landed on three musicians ideally suited for this atmospheric, genre-bending new work. \u201cThis feels like a real band, one that will be around for a while,\u201d he says. Greg Tuohey is the longest-running member, a guitarist who places taste and tone ahead of chops-focused bravado\u2014or, as Parks puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s chasing Miles Davis\u2019 phrasing with Jimi Hendrix\u2019s attitude.\u201d On electric bass is David \u201cDJ\u201d Ginyard Jr., a left-handed player with a distinctively lyrical approach and an aptitude for seeing the bigger musical picture. \u201cHe really understands what the bass does, and he thinks super compositionally,\u201d Parks says, noting how some of Ginyard\u2019s basslines have become integral to the songs. Anchoring the unit is Tommy Crane, a forward-looking, stylistically resourceful drummer who brings both explosive creativity and a producer\u2019s knack for precision. \u201cHe has a very unique ability to internalize and commit to the particular heartbeat of each song,\u201d Parks explains, \u201cbut always with this vital and elastic human element, which is rare to hear in combination with the kinds of grooves we\u2019re exploring.\u201d\n\nTogether they interpret a panoramic set of Parks\u2019 original compositions\u2014from the 21st-century fusion of \u201cKid,\u201d to the odd-metered studio jam \u201cProfessor Strangeweather,\u201d to the trip-hop ambiance and folkish melody of \u201cBells.\u201d The psychedelic \u201cAquarium\u201d\u2014\u201cprobably the sexiest tune on the album,\u201d Parks says, chuckling\u2014conjures up the trippy, sultry neo-soul vibe of Meshell Ndegeocello, before Tuohey offers a solo that channels Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood. \u201cDigital Society\u201d somehow manages to evoke Afrobeat, bluegrass and Aphex Twin. \u201cLilac\u201d is, as Parks describes it, \u201ca solo-piano pop tune.\u201d The leader\u2019s \u201csecret favorite\u201d cut, \u201cDoors Open,\u201d seeks inspiration in late Talk Talk and the \u201cearnestness\u201d of Brian Blade & the Fellowship Band. That closing track is \u201cdefinitely not afraid to go straight for your heart,\u201d Parks says with a laugh.\n\nA prodigal talent raised outside of Seattle, Parks moved with his family to study at the Manhattan School of Music when he was 16. Two years later, on the recommendation of a teacher, NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron, he was invited to join trumpet great Terence Blanchard\u2019s band. That tenure began the relationship with Blue Note that would yield Invisible Cinema, released when Parks was just 24. In The Guardian, John Fordham called the album \u201ca real independent vision,\u201d adding that \u201cParks is a fast-rising star.\u201d In the September 2008 issue of JazzTimes, Parks was named a \u201cNew Jazz Visionary\u201d alongside current giants like Esperanza Spalding, Robert Glasper and Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. Over the ensuing decade, Parks certainly made good on that early promise. He was an essential presence in Kurt Rosenwinkel\u2019s band, including on the guitarist\u2019s well-received double album from 2012, Star of Jupiter. As a member of the supergroup James Farm, also featuring saxophonist Joshua Redman, bassist Matt Penman and drummer Eric Harland, Parks put out two celebrated albums on Nonesuch. In 2013 he released his first disc as an ECM Records artist, Arborescence, which DownBeat\u2019s J.D. Considine called \u201ca forest-invoking solo-piano effort marked by wonderfully detailed narratives and a harmonic palette worthy of Ravel.\u201d Find the Way, an ECM trio session with bassist Ben Street and drummer Billy Hart, followed last year and garnered equally enthusiastic reviews.\n\nOn Little Big, Parks taps into the lessons he\u2019s absorbed throughout those far-reaching experiences, while also progressing some of the au courant sounds he investigated on Invisible Cinema. \u201cThis feels like the most personal record I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he says. What\u2019s more, the album reflects his worldview, an outlook in which optimism and inclusion supersede politics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot out there right now to protest against, and it feels like it\u2019s the artist\u2019s duty to create music that reckons with the issues of the day. Nonetheless, this is not a protest record. It\u2019s not against anything; it\u2019s much more for something. What we\u2019re aiming to do is blend genres and ideas in an open and fluid way, so that structure and freedom work together to serve the larger concept of the song. It\u2019s a way of working together that feels representative of the kind of world I could imagine many of us might want to live in.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Medhane ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Medhane with Akai Solo & Maassai"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Maassai ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8278398.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "femcee | activist. brooklyn, NYC. wordplay + vibrational revolution, yo. confrontational. uncomfortable. but Healing. & love full.", "otherInfo": "Medhane with Akai Solo & Maassai"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Elementfortyseven ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8984917.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Alternative, Grunge", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "We play a mix of rock and alternative music such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, Foo Fighters, U2, R.E.M., Coldplay, and some of our own.

For although the world seems strangely intent on fixing him in his early twenties (or more specifically, a series of internet sites who have seemingly overlooked the fact that biography ages require a yearly update!), the time has come to acknowledge that DJ and producer James Holden is not quite so young anymore. The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Thom Yorke"}, {"Address": "45-58 Vernon Blvd, Queens County, NY 11101", "Artist": "Eleanor Dubinsky ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10137525.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.952819, 40.747015], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Jazz, World, Pop, Jazz Fusion", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "LIC Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Eleanor Dubinsky has found the tender edge where jazz, world, and pop sensibilities meet emotionally forthright songwriting.

His\nmusical influences have ranged from Joe Cocker to Justin Bieber, however he never truly felt that he \"fit\nin\" with any particular style.\nDan turned his tiny cabin on the cruise ship into a home-recording studio, churning out several original\ndemos.

His company Wood Violins is the premier manufacturer of electric violins, violas and cellos worldwide and he holds the patent for the first-ever self-supporting violin. The company stands behind its claim to have made the most important change to the violin in 400 years and is often referred to as the \u201cStradivarius of electric violins.\u201d With a design as stunning as their sound, Wood Violins pack both sonic and visual punch. Their premier electric violin, The Viper, has found favor with musicians as varied as Lady Gaga\u2019s violinist Judy Kang, Carrie Underwood\u2019s violinist Jimmy Herman, and Big and Rich\u2019s violinist Shawn Bailey.\n\nWood is a world-renowned performer who rose to fame as string master and original member of the internationally acclaimed Trans Siberian Orchestra.

His commission credits include The Juilliard School and extensive TV broadcast music including The Winter Olympics and The Tour de France (for which he won an Emmy).\n\nIn addition to his continued solo and commission work, Wood has collaborated with and appeared alongside some of the biggest names in music such as Lenny Kravitz, Celine Dion, and Kanye West.

Today EYS visits upwards of 75 schools per year and there is a waiting list of schools wanting to participate. The organization has been featured on The Today Show and CBS Evening News and in countless local media outlets.\n\nBut for Wood, it\u2019s all about the kids. He\u2019s dedicated to providing educators with the opportunity to ignite their students\u2019 passions and to inspiring students to open their minds and unlock their potential. His book \u201cElectrify Your Strings: The Mark Wood Improvisational Violin Method\u201d (published by Cherry Lane) is regarded as the definitive electric violin method book. The first in a series of forthcoming educational books, Wood is passionate about providing educators and students with the tools they need to succeed in the classroom and beyond.\n\nA genuine family man, Wood runs his operations alongside his wife, business partner, and longtime collaborator Laura Kaye out of their home in Port Washington, New York.

Concertgoers can look forward to a unique live music experience. Zach plays a different set every night as an ultimate expression of living in the moment, with the hopes of opening windows to people's souls to remind them of how good it feels to be alive.\n\nOn his path towards becoming a successful touring musician, Deputy serendipitously landed a solo gig in his early 20s by walking into a bar just after that night's featured artist had bailed. Deputy soon introduced the world to the sound he'd eventually dub \"island-infused, drum 'n' bass, gospel-ninja-soul.\" By 2008 he'd released his debut album Out of the Water and-thanks to his ingenuity in looping-made his name as an unforgettable one-man-band live act. The new music kept flowing, and since then Deputy has released four critically acclaimed full length studio albums. As a special sneak peek into his new music, Zach will sprinkle songs from his upcoming album throughout his sets this fall.\n\nReflecting on his live shows, Zach says \"music to me is about bringing people together from all walks of life and living in the moment with a joyful heart!\" Deputy's one man show creates a unique experience straight from the soul every night, raw and uncut with absolutely nothing prerecorded. As a pioneer of looping and synth guitar work well ahead of his time, he's taken the technology to uncharted lands delivering a pocket groove unique to the ears. Zach says, \"call me crazy, but I've always believed live music should always be live, but I've also always loved a good tranced out dance party too.\" With this in mind he tailored his performances to meet his convictions. Combining his family roots Island vibe with his low country southern soul, a pinch of tranced out hippy hop, and a vast amount of talent, Zach's sound emerges in focus.\n\nSelect shows will feature Zach's vibrant band The Yankees, a bluesy jam band who will be supporting Deputy with keys, Drums, Bass, and a whole lot of soul. Alongside Deputy on tour, supporting acts will include powerhouse musicians Audacity Brass Band, Afterfunk & Sarah Blacker, the Trailheads, and Mike Pinto.\n\nThis fall Zach Deputy will hit the road and perform live across the east coast of the United States.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers.

Either way, allow us to present the real story from the horse\u2019s (man\u2019s) mouth\u2026\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: (No animals were harmed in the making of this bio.)\n\nThroughout over three decades in music, Steve Poltz did it all and more\u2014often shared by way of his rockin\u2019 countrified folk slices of sardonic Americana (hatched in Halifax). Of course, he co-wrote Jewel\u2019s multiplatinum Hot 100-topping megahit \u201cYou Were Meant For Me,\u201d but he also went on a whale watch with her and a few federales that turned into a drug bust. The two still share the story at every festival they play together. He made his bones as the frontman for underground legends The Rugburns, who burned rubber crisscrossing the continent on marathon tours and still pop up once in a while for the rare and quickly sold out reunion gig.\n\nIn 20 years since his full-length solo debut, One Left Shoe, he blessed the world\u2019s ears with twelve solo records, spanning the acclaimed 2010 Dreamhouse and most recently Folk Singer in 2015. NPR summed it up best, \u201cCritics and fans alike now regard Poltz as a talented and prolific songwriter.\u201d By 2016, he survived a stroke, endured anything the music industry could throw at him, and still performed like \u201c280 days a year.\u201d\n\nHowever, he still never lived in Nashville, which represents a turning point in the story and the genesis of his 2018 Red House Records debut, Shine On\u2026\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend Sharon sold the condo we were living in, and I was ready to live in a van, which seemed like a good idea for one night\u2014then I decided I wanted a kitchen and a closet,\u201d he admits. \u201cSharon wanted to move to Nashville, because she thought it would be good for me. It caused a huge fight. I\u2019d been in San Diego since 1980, and that\u2019s where I cut my musical teeth. I thought I\u2019d never leave. In fact, at the height of our fight, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving San Diego. I am San Diego!\u2019 This makes me laugh now. As soon as I got to Nashville, I immediately knew I wanted to make a record in \u2018Music City\u2019.\u201d\nSo, the man who once protested \u201cI am San Diego\u201d made Shine On in his new home of Nashville with one of its elder statesman behind the board, Will Kimbrough [Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell]. Holing up in the studio at Kimbrough\u2019s house, nothing would be off limits. Together, they unlocked the kind of creative chemistry you only hear about in band bios\u2014but for real.\n\n\u201cI respect Will so much, and I\u2019d always wanted to work with him,\u201d says Steve. \u201cLike two mad scientists, we just took our time and had fun. We didn\u2019t overthink things. Everything felt organic. We ate soul food and drank lots of really good coffee. We tried out weird sounds, and the songs always started with voice and guitar\u2014no click track, just how I\u2019d play them. I road tested many of them, and they were ripe for the picking when recording time came around.\u201d\n\nEvoking themes of \u201chope, love, contemplation, celebration of Wednesday, pharmacists, and the fact that windows are not inanimate objects and they sometimes have conversations with each other,\u201d the record represents Steve at his most inspired and insightful. The opener and title track \u201cShine On\u201d pairs a delicate vocal with lithely plucked acoustic strings as he urges, \u201cShine on, shine on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song was a gift,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI woke up really early in Encinitas, California at Sharon\u2019s sister\u2019s house. The sun was just coming up. I was all alone in perfect solitude. My guitar was there. The sky was gorgeous. I wrote it as a poem. Everyone always told me, \u2018Never start a record with a really slow song.\u2019 So, seeing that I have O.D.D. (Oppositional Defiance Disorder), I started my record with one. I love the mood it sets. It\u2019s almost like my mission statement, trying to find some semblance of positivity and light in a sometimes ruthless world.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cPharmacist,\u201d rustling guitar and harmonica propel a tale of \u201cthis dude having a crush on his pharmacist.\u201d It also serves as an extension of his friendship with neighbor Scot Sax\u2014with whom he shares the podcast \u201cOne Hit Neighbors\u201d (since they\u2019ve both had one hit song). Meanwhile, he joined forces with Molly Tuttle on \u201c4th of July,\u201d which, of course, came to life on the 3rd of July. \u201cBallin On Wednesday\u201d drew its title and chorus from a diner checkout girl (with a super cool gold tooth) who Steve paid with a $100 bill and she replied, \u201cOooh, ballin\u2019 on a Wednsday.\u201d The finale \u201cAll Things Shine\u201d skips along on sparse instrumentation as Steve sends a message.\n\n\u201c\u2018All Things Shine\u2019 came about after one of the many mass shootings on this planet,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI was feeling overwhelmed. So, I wanted to put my feelings into words and melody. I was thinking that even if we\u2019re feeling hopeless that there is still beauty. All things shine in their own way.\u201d\nWho could contend that?\n\nIn the end, for everything you can call him \u201csearcher, smartass, movie freak, lover of technology, news junkie, baseball fan to nth degree, lapsed catholic who still believes in god even though all his friends are atheists and think he\u2019s an idiot, and maker of fun,\u201d you might just call Steve that little light in the dark we all need in this day and age.\n\nOr Nashville\u2019s Canadian Jiminy Cricket\u2026\n\n\u201cI hope Shine On makes listeners smile and feel welcome, and they want to share it with their friends,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic means energy to me.

How does having no idea how you\u2019ll ever retire affect planning your future?\u201d\n\nSonically, the new album does an incredible job of reflecting these anxieties. To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording. On the album, Denitzio is joined by new guitarist Frank Piegaro, and longtime drummer Mikey Erg and bassist Nick Psillas. Unlike their previous releases, 2015\u2019s Imaginary Life (Don Giovanni) and 2017\u2019s Survival Pop (Side One Dummy/reissued by 6131 Records), the band recorded the majority of the album live in the studio. The result is a rock epic for these times, imbued with heart that is felt throughout the album.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1286 Hicksville Rd, Massapequa, NY 11758", "Artist": "Cuthbert Live ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9298868.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.48267, 40.71377], "Date": "Tue Mar 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-31", "Genre": "Rock, Country And Soul., Pop", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Paddy's Loft", "moreBioInfo": "Paul C.

For although the world seems strangely intent on fixing him in his early twenties (or more specifically, a series of internet sites who have seemingly overlooked the fact that biography ages require a yearly update!), the time has come to acknowledge that DJ and producer James Holden is not quite so young anymore. The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Due to restrictions put in place to minimise the spread of COVID-19, we regret that the North American leg of the Thom Yorke Tomorrow?s Modern Boxes tour is postponed.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1160 Broadway 5th floor, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Kris Davis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7317675.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988693, 40.744678], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "The Jazz Gallery", "moreBioInfo": "Pianist-composer Kris Davis has blossomed as one of the singular talents on the New York jazz scene, a deeply thoughtful, resolutely individual artist who offers \u201cuncommon creative adventure,\u201d according to JazzTimes.

Paradoxical Frog, the trio\u2019s 2010 album on Clean Feed, was included on Best of the Year lists by National Public Radio, The New York Times and All About Jazz. In addition to her work as a leader, Davis has performed with such top figures as Paul Motian, Bill Frisell, Tim Berne, John Hollenbeck, Michael Formanek and Mary Halvorson. Davis started playing piano at age 6, studying classical music through the Royal Conservatory in Canada and formulating her desire for a life in music by playing in the school jazz band at age 12. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in Jazz Piano from the University of Toronto and attended the Banff Centre for the Arts jazz program in 1997 and 2000. The pianist received a Canada Council grant to relocate to New York and study composition with Jim McNeely, then another to study extended piano techniques with Benoit Delbecq in Paris. She holds a master\u2019s in Classical Composition from the City College of New York, and she teaches at the School for Improvised Music. The Jazz Gallery has given Davis a commissioning residency to write for her trio with Rainey and John H\u00e9bert to take place in May 2013, and the Shifting Foundation awarded her a grant to compose and record a large-ensemble project.

For 40 years, the Southern Rock legends celebrated triumphs, endured tragedies and survived legal nightmares to remain one of the most influential and best-loved bands of the genre. Now The Outlaws return with new music, new focus and an uncompromising new mission: It\u2019s about a band of brothers bound together by history, harmony and the road. It\u2019s about a group that respects its own legacy while refusing to be defined by its past. But most of all, it\u2019s about pride.\n\nIt\u2019s About Pride is the new album from The Outlaws, a record 4 years in the making and perhaps 20 or more in the waiting. And for original Outlaws singer/ guitarist Henry Paul, it\u2019s a hard-fought revival whose success can be measured in old fans and new music. \u201cBecause The Outlaws have been out of the public eye for so long, it\u2019s almost like starting over,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut because of the band\u2019s history, we\u2019re seeing this as a new chapter. We\u2019ve written and recorded this album on our own terms, and we\u2019re out to make a significant impression. What our fans loved then they still love now, because we are just as good or even better than we were. Most of all, they recognize the heart of what it is we still do.\u201d For co-founding drummer Monte Yoho, the journey is both bittersweet and jubilant. \u201cI still think about the friends we made when we first came into this industry, how we struggled to define this thing that became known as \u2018Southern Rock\u2019,\u201d Yoho says. \u201cThis new album embodies all the things we shared musically and personally, as well as the relationships we have with our fans to this day. It\u2019s about where we\u2019ve been, where we\u2019re going, and why we still love to do this.\u201d\n\nHistory lesson: Formed in Tampa in 1972, The Outlaws \u2013 known for their triple-guitar rock attack and three-part country harmonies \u2013 became one of the first acts signed by Clive Davis (at the urging of Ronnie Van Zant) to his then-fledgling Arista Records. The band\u2019s first three albums The Outlaws, Lady In Waiting and Hurry Sundown \u2013 featuring such rock radio favorites as \u201cThere Goes Another Love Song\u201d, \u201cGreen Grass & High Tides\u201d, \u201cKnoxville Girl\u201d and \u201cFreeborn Man\u201d \u2013 would become worldwide gold and platinum landmarks of the Southern Rock era. Known as \u2018The Florida Guitar Army\u2019 by their fans, The Outlaws earned a formidable reputation as an incendiary live act touring with friends The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Marshall Tucker Band and The Charlie Daniels Band as well as The Doobie Brothers, The Who, Eagles and The Rolling Stones. Henry Paul left after the group\u2019s third album to form The Henry Paul Band for Atlantic Records, and later the multi-Platinum country trio Blackhawk. Over the next 20+ years, The Outlaws would experience rampant personnel changes, tonal missteps, ill-fated reunions and bitter trademark battles that left fans \u2013 not to mention Paul and Yoho \u2013 frustrated and saddened. And with the tragic deaths of co-founding members Frank O\u2019Keefe and Billy Jones in 1995, and especially vocalist/lead guitarist Hughie Thomasson in 2007, it was feared that The Outlaws\u2019 trail had come to an end.\n\n\u201cThe Outlaws were the one area of my career where I had regrets,\u201d admits Paul. \u201cMore importantly, I think it was the one area in my career where I thought I still have something to prove. I felt compelled to stick my neck out and take a chance of putting this band back together. I knew we would be judged, but I hoped we would be judged on our abilities.\u201d Along with founding members Paul and Yoho, the band features several of Southern Rock\u2019s most respected veterans: Lead guitarist and longtime Outlaw Chris Anderson is well known for his collaborations with artists that include Dickey Betts, Lucinda Williams, Hank Williams Jr., and Skynyrd. Co-lead guitarist Steve Grisham - who joined the band in mid-2013 following the medical leave of guitarist Billy Crain - is a former member of the Soldiers Of Fortune era Outlaws, a noted songwriter whose tracks include The Henry Paul Band's Top 40 hit \"Keepin Our Love Alive\", and a co-founder of the Southern Rock all-stars, Brothers of the Southland. Keyboardist/vocalist Dave Robbins is a co-founding member of Blackhawk and has written hit songs for artists that include Restless Heart, Kenny Rogers and Eric Clapton. Bassist/vocalist Randy Threet has performed with Pam Tillis, Trisha Yearwood and Blackhawk, and is familiar to TV audiences from USA Network\u2019s \u2018Nashville Star\u2019. \u201cFrom the very beginning, our band had a heart,\u201d Monte Yoho says. \u201cAnd a lot of people who come out and see this incarnation of the band respond to the exact same things we used to put on that stage in the \u201870s and \u201880s.\u201d\n\nOn that stage, the band burns hotter than ever: \u201cThe Outlaws helped define Southern Rock for me and for generations of fans,\u201d wrote music journalist Bill Robinson in June 2012 in The Huffington Post. \u201cSeeing them onstage with The Charlie Daniels Band, Marshall Tucker Band, Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd or countless others was, for a long time, one of the best experiences I could have. And so it was again when I saw The Outlaws play recently.\u201d The Outlaws\u2019 live shows \u2013 more than 150 per year \u2013 are blazing 2+ hour tributes to the band\u2019s rich history and fiery rebirth. Classic tracks and fan favorites from the first three albums \u2013 as well as The Henry Paul Band\u2019s definitive \u201cGrey Ghost\u201d \u2013 share the spotlight with songs from the new disc that are already being embraced by audiences. \u201cI think the new songs go back to those first three classic albums, when the band was proud of its influences from country, blues and jazz,\u201d says Billy Crain. \u201cPlus, Chris Anderson and I have honored and maybe even stepped up the legacy of the \u2018guitar army\u2019. Fans are coming away from shows feeling a part of the Outlaws experience.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s the new album \u2013 produced by Michael Bush and Henry Paul \u2013 that brings the experience home. The disc opens with \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Another Night\u201d, a scorching take on the band\u2019s history complete with monster harmonies and a killer hook. \u201cHidin\u2019 Out In Tennessee\u201d delivers classic Outlaws country/bluegrass energy. \u201cBorn To Be Bad\u201d is badass biker boogie and \u201cLast Ghost Town\u201d is kickass guitar rock. \u201cNothin\u2019 Main About Main Street\u201d is an affecting Springsteen/Seger style look at lost small-town life. \u201cThe Flame\u201d \u2013 Hughie Thomasson\u2019s nickname \u2013 is a potent tribute to the much-loved late Outlaw. Chris Anderson\u2019s \u201cTrail Of Tears\u201d electrifies via bitter history, intense vocals and searing guitars. \u201cRight Where I Belong\u201d, \u201cAlex\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cTrouble Rides A Fast Horse\u201d could easily be lost tracks from any of the band\u2019s first three albums. The disc\u2019s closer, \u201cSo Long\u201d is a haunting re-recording of Henry\u2019s 1979 classic. \u201cIt was the first song on the first Henry Paul Band album, and it\u2019s the final song on this record,\u201d explains Paul. \u201cI wanted it to be a sort of coda to the new music, but I also want it to be a relevant part of the new Outlaws landscape. I think it\u2019s one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever written, and I think we\u2019ve done an admirable job of giving it a new personality.\u201d But the new album\u2019s true centerpiece is its title track, co-written by Henry Paul and Billy Crain. \u201cIt\u2019s About Pride\u201d is both tribute and testimony from a band that has lived it all, played it all, and returns to reclaim it all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a part of something that started long ago,\u201d Henry Paul sings reflectively, \u201ca Southern band of brothers bound together by the road/They came from Florida, Georgia, Carolina and Tennessee/With old guitars, tattoos and scars, straight from the heart of Dixie/And our rebel pride.\u201d From its towering chorus to its searing guitar-onslaught finale, \u201cIt\u2019s About Pride\u201d is a fierce first-person anthem to the genre, delivered with the poignancy and power of absolute survivors. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional song,\u201d Paul says. \u201cDepending on my mood and the night, sometimes it\u2019s all I can do to get the words out without crying. It summons up a lot of images of people who are no longer with us, of times we shared standing tall together for the first time. When I first wrote the end of the second verse \u2013 \u201cThe reason \u2018Sweet Home Alabama\u2019 means so much to me/Is it\u2019s about pride\u201d \u2013 I knew that people would feel a lot of those same emotions. It\u2019s about an accumulated experience of separation, loss and success.\u201d Almost instantly, the song \u2013 and the entire album \u2013 is classic Southern Rock and classic Outlaws.\n\nRight now, The Outlaws are headed back on the road, back on the radio and back into the hearts of fans nationwide. \u201cI\u2019m seeing this thing we\u2019ve had for four decades be exposed to whole new audiences,\u201d Monte Yoho says. \u201cWe\u2019re having a second life as a band, and it feels better than ever. Best of all, I\u2019m still doing it with some of the same people I\u2019ve known for most of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want people to hear this album and see our show and realize that The Outlaws are back,\u201d says Henry Paul. \u201cOur goal is to unite the fans and bring the band back into the light. In a way, this is like a second chance at my first love. It\u2019s about finishing what we started.\u201d For Henry, Monte, Chris, Steve, Dave and Randy, it\u2019s about a band of brothers who love playing their own style of rock, and who 40 years ago first got the chance to take it from Florida to the world.\n\nFor The Outlaws, it\u2019s still about the music. And now more than ever, it\u2019s about pride.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1120 Manhattan Ave, New York, NY 11222", "Artist": "Spylacopa ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/122036.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.955172, 40.736777], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Saint Vitus Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Candiria guitarist John Lamcchia brings forth stunning dark ambient heaviness with his solo project Spylacopa."}, {"Address": "6 Delancey St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "BIIANCO ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9849189.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993383, 40.720353], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Pop, Downtempo, Electronic, Chillwave, Electro Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bowery Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "BIIANCO is the electronic chill-wave brainchild of LA-based multi-instrumentalist and producer, Gabby Bianco.", "otherInfo": "Opening for VERITE"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Worriers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9979873.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Punk, Melodic Punk, Pop Punk, Rock, Queer, Feminist", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Town Hall Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Worriers' new album You or Someone You Know is an ambitious rock record that dares to push the genre forward. On the album, songwriter Lauren Denitzio (they/them) addresses themes of reconstructing and reexamining relationships as they relate to the current zeitgeist. \u201cI thought a lot about how the state of the world makes any sort of partnership stressful. The album is partially autobiographical but it\u2019s also addressing more universal questions that people have to ask these days. Do we have kids? Do we move to a place that could be underwater in 20 years? How does having no idea how you\u2019ll ever retire affect planning your future?\u201d\n\nSonically, the new album does an incredible job of reflecting these anxieties. To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording. On the album, Denitzio is joined by new guitarist Frank Piegaro, and longtime drummer Mikey Erg and bassist Nick Psillas. Unlike their previous releases, 2015\u2019s Imaginary Life (Don Giovanni) and 2017\u2019s Survival Pop (Side One Dummy/reissued by 6131 Records), the band recorded the majority of the album live in the studio.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences. I can\u2019t stop, this is what I do.\u201d\n\nA crowd pleaser whose music is impossible to classify but very easy to enjoy, KJ Denhert is in her own special category.", "otherInfo": "First Wednesday of every month.

Favorite musste daraufhin einen Gro\u00dfteil seiner Jugend in Waisenh\u00e4usern verbringen und wurde nat\u00fcrlich durch diese Zeit sehr beeinflusst. Er musste sich alleine durchschlagen und sammelte viele Erfahrungen, die ihn gepr\u00e4gt haben.\n\nIn dieser Zeit kam auch der erste Kontakt mit Rapmusik zustande. Er merkte schnell, dass er einfach rappen muss und so entstanden im Alter von 15 Jahren seine ersten Texte und Aufnahmen.\n\n\u00dcber Umwege geriet Favorites Demotape 2004 an Slick One, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt gerade mit der Gr\u00fcndung von Selfmade Records besch\u00e4ftigt war. Sofort war er von dem Talent, der ausdrucksvollen Stimme und dem Rapstil des damals 18j\u00e4hrigen beeindruckt und somit wurde Favorite der erste Newcomer, der fest zu Selfmade Records geh\u00f6rte.\n\nNach dem Einstand mit dem Track \u201eRuhrpott 4 Life\u201c auf dem Schwarzes Gold Sampler machte sich Favorite an das Album mit seinem Rapkollegen Jason, welches im Oktober 2005 unter dem Titel \u201eRappen kann t\u00f6dlich sein\u201c \u00fcber Selfmade Records erschien und f\u00fcr einen Einstand nach Ma\u00df sorgte. Danach konnte er mit diversen Features, u.a. auf dem \u201eZuh\u00e4ltertape\u201c des neuen Labelmates Kollegah, \u00fcberzeugen.\n\nAm 26. Januar 2007 erscheint nun Favorites erstes Soloalbum \u201eHARLEKIN\u201c. Die Produktionen stammen von den TOP Producern RIZBO, FLIPSTAR und JIMMY LEDRAC (SWE). Der Albumtitel beschreibt die zwei Seiten des mittlerweile 20-j\u00e4hrigen Newcomers: Einmal die humorvolle und provokante Seite und andererseits die ernste und nachdenkliche Gegenseite, gepr\u00e4gt von Favorites Vergangenheit. Diese Gegens\u00e4tze werden auch durch das Cover ausger\u00fcckt, welches von Prinz Pi gestaltet wurde.\n\nAuf \u201eHARLEKIN\u201c wird deutlich, welche beachtliche Vielseitigkeit und thematische Variation m\u00f6glich ist, und dies auf einem konstant hohen technischen Niveau.

The musical is comprised of the book by Joe Masteroff, lyrics by Fred Ebb and music by John Kander.\nIt is based on John Van Druten's play I Am a Camera, which was in turn based on the novel Goodbye to Berlin by Christopher Isherwood. Its initial run was produced and directed by Hal Prince and starred Bert Convy, Jack Gilford, Jill Haworth, Lotte Lenya, Joel Grey, Peg Murray, and Edward Winter.

Their sound is heavily influenced by glam rock, also incorporating some Brazilian rock elements. Currently (as of February 2007) the band is comprised of Marvel (vocals), Myself Deluxe (bass), Peter Glitter (guitar) and De la Foca (drums).\n\nCabaret has somewhat of a cult status after their first album, \"Cabaret\", received a wide span of good reviews from both the alternative and mainstream Brazilian music press. The band is also known for their theatrical live performances, often gaining new fans after energetic performances, specially of underground hits \"Messias Pessoal\", \"Dama da Noite\" and \"Cad\u00e1ver no Palco\". The band's website is http://www.radiocabaret.com.br .\n\n\n- The Polish Cabaret was formed in 1997 by two friends: Jaros\u0142aw Pawlik and Mariusz Radecki. But it is the year 2000, when a new musician - Micha\u0142 \u2018IA\u2019 Bieniek (ex-Noise Gate) - joins CABARET, that can actually be considered the initial date of the band\u2019s conscious artistic activity.

He is best known for his opera Carmen.\n\nHe was born in Paris. He was registered with the legal name Alexandre-C\u00e9sar-L\u00e9opold Bizet, but was baptized Georges Bizet and was always known by the latter name. A child prodigy, he entered the prestigious Paris Conservatory of Music a fortnight before his tenth birthday.\n\nIn 1857 he shared a prize offered by Jacques Offenbach for a setting of the one-act operetta Le docteur Miracle and won the Prix de Rome. As per the conditions of the scholarship, he studied in Rome for three years. There, his talent began to mature with such works as the opera Don Procopio. Besides this stay in Rome, Bizet lived in the Paris area for his entire life.\n\nFollowing his stay in Rome, he returned to Paris where he dedicated himself to composition. Early into his return to Paris, Georges's mother died. In 1863 he composed the opera Les p\u00eacheurs de perles (The Pearl Fishers) for the Theatre-Lyrique. During this period Bizet also wrote the opera La jolie fille de Perth, his well-known L'arl\u00e9sienne (written as incidental music for a play), and the piano piece Jeux d'enfants (Children's games) He also wrote the romantic opera Djamileh, which is often seen as a percursor to Carmen. His first symphony, the Symphony in C Major, was written at the Paris Conservatory when he was only seventeen years old, evidently as a student assignment. It seems that Bizet completely forgot about it himself, and it was not discovered again until 1935, in the dusty archives of the Conservatory library. Upon its first performance, it was immediately hailed as a junior masterwork and a welcome addition to the early Romantic period repertoire. A delightful work (and a prodigious one, from a seventeen-year-old boy), the symphony is noteworthy for bearing an amazing stylistic resemblance to the music of Franz Schubert, whose work was virtually unknown in Paris at that time (with the possible exception of a few of his songs). A second symphony, \"Roma\" was not completed.\n\nBizet's best-known work is his 1875 opera, Carmen, which was based on an 1846 novel of the same name by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e. Influenced by Giuseppe Verdi, he composed the title role in Carmen for a mezzo-soprano. Not an immediate success, Bizet became despondent over the perceived failure, but praise came from such luminaries as Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Tchaikovsky, and Debussy, who recognized its greatness. Their views were prophetic, as the public eventually made Carmen one of the most popular works in operatic history.\n\nAlthough most known as a composer, Bizet was also an extraordinarily fine pianist, whose playing was praised by no less a judge than Franz Liszt himself. After Bizet flawlessly sightread a complex piece, Liszt said he considered Bizet one of the three finest pianists in Europe.\n\nBizet had long suffered from quinsy, a painful inflammation of the tonsils associated with angina and never got to enjoy Carmen's success. Just a few months after the opera's debut, he died on his sixth wedding anniversary at the early age of 36, the official cause of death being listed as a failed heart due to \"acute articular rheumatism\". He was interred in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.\n\n[source: wikipedia 2006 07 21 \u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bizet]", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "881 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "J\u00f6rg Widmann ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9205710.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980276, 40.764881], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Schumann\u2019s lyrical fairy stories and fantasy pieces set the tone for this program of colorful tales and wild flights of fancy.

The group consists of Nick Anderson (vocals), Nick Schmidt (guitar), Aaron Kelley (bass), and Billy Nally (drums). Heavily influenced by groups such as The Pixies, The Strokes, Weezer, and Vampire Weekend, this 5-piece isn't afraid to blend undeniably catchy choruses, with self-deprecative, honest lyrics and vocals that pull you right to the center of each song.\n\nThe band actually recorded their debut EP on a whim, alongside friend and engineer Andrew D\u2019Angelo, when they were surprised with the news that a friend had been granted access to a studio for just a few days. With a total budget of $0, and only a week as a band under their belts, the group set out to record the best songs that they could in 3 days. After working ridiculous hours through the night, and to the next day whenever they could get in the studio, the 3 days were over and the EP was cut. Little did the band know, they were not even allowed to be in the studio that week. So through feelings of guilt and worry, they cleaned every bit of information of theirs from the studio computer, every crumb of Dominoes from the studio couch, and they were off with their entire EP on an hard drive in a backpack.\n\nThe homemade \"We Are The Wrecks\" EP was self-released in March 2016. After hundreds of spins on Sirius XM's Alt Nation, and features on some of Spotify's biggest rock playlists, the band signed to Another Century/Sony Music in December of 2016. Their debut single Favorite Liar broke the Top 40 on alternative radio, has over 6 million plays on Spotify, and spent almost a dozen weeks in the top 10 of Alt Nation's Alt-18 Countdown. After signing their record deal, The Wrecks sought out to record a new EP in Los Angeles. 3 weeks into recording, and after blowing almost the entire budget, the band decided the music was going in the wrong direction and threw the EP away. \"I just felt that we had strayed too far from the core of the band's sound,\" says frontman Nick Anderson. \"It sounded like we were trying really hard to get on the radio or something, and I feel like that rarely gets you on the radio anyway.\" So after getting their label and management on board, The Wrecks decided to move into Anderson's grandmother's house in his small hometown (Wellsville, NY) to work on the new record in a barn studio that their friend Patrick Barry owns. Co-produced again by Nick Anderson and Andrew D'Angelo, The Wrecks say their new upcoming EP \"comes from a genuine place, and is something we're all truly proud of.\"", "otherInfo": "The Driver Era"}, {"Address": "311 West 34th Street, New York City, NY 10001", "Artist": "James Holden ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8672091.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.994274, 40.752704], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Techno, Electronic, Progressive House", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Manhattan Center Hammerstein Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "James Holden is far from your average DJ-producer.\n\nThe wunderkind James Holden has finally come of age, and has delivered up the debut album to prove it: and at 28, about time too! For although the world seems strangely intent on fixing him in his early twenties (or more specifically, a series of internet sites who have seemingly overlooked the fact that biography ages require a yearly update!), the time has come to acknowledge that DJ and producer James Holden is not quite so young anymore. The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Due to restrictions put in place to minimise the spread of COVID-19, we regret that the North American leg of the Thom Yorke Tomorrow?s Modern Boxes tour is postponed.

Their sound is characterized by a synthesis of orchestral backing, lounge jazz, and soul; the lush orchestrations of multi-instrumentalist Dickon Hinchliffe and the smoky baritone of lead vocalist Stuart A. Staples are the band's hallmarks. Tindersticks have employed electric guitars, as most rock bands have done, but augment their instrumentation with a wide array of instruments: Rhodes piano, glockenspiel, vibraphone, violin, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, bassoon, Hammond organ, and many more are prominently utilized in the music of Tindersticks.\n\nThe band has a cult following in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, although the eclectic and unique sound Tindersticks possesses never made significant inroads in the mainstream.\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Stuart Ashton Staples, born 14 November 1965 - Lead voice, guitar, melodica\n* Dickon James Hinchliffe, born 9 July 1967 - violin, guitar, voice, piano, string and brass arrangements\n* Neil Timothy Fraser, - born 22 November 1962 - lead guitar, vibraphone\n* David Leonard Boulter, born 27 February 1965 - keyboards, percussion\n* Alasdair Robert De Villeneuve Macaulay, born 2 August 1965 - drums, percussion, trumpet\n* Mark Andrew Colwill, born 12 May 1960 - bass guitar\n\nThe band formed in late 1991, Staples, Boulter, Frazer, Macauley and Hinchcliffe having previously been members of Asphalt Ribbons. The final band line-up for the \"old horse\" mini-LP (1991) was: Stuart Staples (vocals) Dave Boulter (organ & accordion) Neil Fraser (guitar) Dickon Hinchliffe (Guitar & strings) Al Macauley (percussion & drums) John Thompson (bass). Mark Colwill was recruited when John Thompson left the Asphalt Ribbons, but it is not sure if he played any gigs under the Asphalt Ribbons name. Then they changed their name to Tindersticks after Stuart A. Staples discovered a box of German matches on a Greek beach.\n\nTindersticks started recording demo tapes in 1992, and were signed by Tippy Toe Records who released their first single, \"Patchwork\".\n\nTheir self-titled first and second albums established their signature sound and received widespread critical acclaim. Their live performances, often augmented by large string sections and even, on occasion, a full orchestra, were rapturously received. (The live album Bloomsbury Theatre 12.3.95 is a recording of one such concert.) By the time of the third album, Curtains, however, it was clear that a change of direction was called for. There was a certain ennui to the songs, and the lengthy \"Ballad of Tindersticks\" was a weary swipe at the pressures of being a touring band.\n\nThe fourth album, Simple Pleasure, lived up to its title with a series of snappy, direct songs influenced by soul music. The female backing vocals on several tracks, and the respectful cover of Odyssey's \"If You're Looking For A Way Out\", signalled the band's wish to move towards lighter, more soulful material. However, the inner sleeve's documentation of the number of takes each track went through was evidence that the band continued to adopt a painstaking approach to recording.\n\nThe fifth album, Can Our Love, continued the band's soulful direction, in particular evidence on the tender \"Sweet Release\" and in the nod to the Chi-Lites in the title of \"Chilitetime\".\n\nThe sixth and most recent album, Waiting For The Moon, was more stripped down and introspective in nature, particularly on the harrowing \"4.48 Psychosis\" (based on the play of the same name by the British playwright Sarah Kane) and \"Sometimes It Hurts\". Only the bouncy \"Just A Dog\" lightened the otherwise melancholy mood of the album.\n\nIn 2005 Staples embarked on a solo career and there was resultant speculation that the band had split. Staples has so far produced two solo albums, Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04 and Leaving Songs. The title of the second album, and Staples' notes on it, indicate that Tindersticks may indeed be at an end: \"These are songs written on the verge of leaving the things I loved and stepping into a new unknown life, both musically and personally. I was always aware that these songs were the end of something, a kind of closing a circle of a way of writing that I started so long ago and I knew I had to move on from.\"\n\nIn September 2006, the band played a one-off concert at London's Barbican Centre, performing their second album in full with a nine-member string section and two brass players, including former collaborator Terry Edwards on trumpet. This concert brought the band's members back together. A new recording process in 2007 resulted in a new album, The Hungry Saw, which was released on April 28th 2008.\n\nIn the meantime, in July 2007, Island Records had released The BBC Sessions, a double CD compilation of the band's sessions for BBC radio programmes.\n\nAs well as their six studio albums, the band has produced the soundtracks for two films by the French director Claire Denis, Nenette et Boni and Trouble Every Day.\nThey recorded a cover of the Four Tops song, \"What Is A Man\", for the theme to the British TV series The Sins.\nThe Tindersticks song Tiny Tears was featured prominently in the Series 1 episode \"Isabella\" of HBO's The Sopranos. Additionally, a version of \"Running Wild\" was played during the ending credits of the penultimate episode of the series, \"The Blue Comet\". In the Season One Finale of Brotherhood, \"El Diablo En El Ojo\" is used twice.\n\n* Tindersticks (aka First Album) (This Way Up, 1993)\n* Tindersticks (aka Second Album) (This Way Up, 1995)\n* Curtains (This Way Up, 1997)\n* Simple Pleasure (Island, 1999)\n* Can Our Love...

Music was always one of his passions, but not something he seriously pursued until coming face-to-face with death. Ollie shifted his focus to creating dynamic deliveries and engaging lyricism to reflect his experiences \u2014 including those concerning overcoming obstacles, facing adversity, and being proud of who you are. This path lead him to become the person he is today \u2013 an artist inspiring others using the mantra, \u201cMore Than Music.\u201d\n\nPulling inspiration from hip-hop/r&b, pop, rock and country, the latter of which serving as a representation of his small town upbringing, Ollie\u2019s music presents itself as a unique catalogue of sounds and cadences. Moreover, Ollie\u2019s skillset highlights his ability to adapt to different genres effortlessly, creating a series of lyrical paintings that are not only captivating, but relatable.\n\n\u201cI started off being heavily influenced by hip-hop, and as time went by, I learned to appreciate a lot more music. When I began exploring different genres, my music and sound started to take form. I found my voice,\u201d notes the Toronto-based artist.\n\nEarly in his career, Ollie was heavily involved in the YouTube community. At the age of 16, he opened his first YouTube channel and began uploading gameplay commentaries. This eventually drove him to create a music channel where he would promote the sounds of up-and-coming artists. Ollie\u2019s desire to promote other undiscovered talent only further inspired him to begin releasing his own music under an alias that took form from his father's childhood nickname. He began, writing, recording and releasing these songs, quickly getting featured on videos of popular gamers and personalities, building awareness around Ollie in the YouTube community. This subsequently translated to over 18K subscribers on YouTube, and over 430K monthly listeners on Spotify. In turn, this created an unbreakable bond between an artist and his constantly growing fanbase.\n\nWith a focused vision, and a clear message behind his music, Ollie\u2019s newest endeavor, a 3-track EP titled, Lost, is setting a promising foundation for 2019. This release coincides with shows in Europe, the U.S. and Canada. Lost, which explores themes of insecurities, paranoia and relationships, adds a complex layer to Ollie\u2019s music, once more highlighting his musicality and fearlessness of being himself, and giving fans something to connect to intimately.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of messages and comments from people talking about how a certain song was able to impact their life, or how they found a form of comfort through my words,\u201d he explains. \u201cI try and spend as much time as I can everyday talking with my fans one-on-one, not just about my music, but on a personal level, something \u2018More Than Music\u2019.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Maybe We Were Supposed To Tour"}, {"Address": "North Plainfield, NJ", "Artist": "Tam Garcia ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9215170.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.4274, 40.6301], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Reggae, Pop, Alternative, R&b", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Mi Casa", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-Songwriter Tam Garcia has been performing since he was fourteen years old.

The Z3\u2019s \u201cFunky Takes on Frank\u201d began as Tim, Beau and Bill\u2019s way of playing the music they\u2019ve obsessed over for years to the audiences that come to see them right now. With nothing but guitar, Hammond organ/keys, drums and three voices, The Z3 tackled everything from Freak Out to Broadway the Hard Way with a playful and adventurous spirit that has thus far tickled the fancies of both diehard FZ fans as well as those that \u201cnever knew they liked him.\u201d\n\nAnd then they met Ed Mann.\n\nEd played mallet instruments, percussion, sang and did a mean Bob Dylan impersonation in the Frank Zappa band from 1977-88, in addition to his many solo albums and other collaborations. He first jammed with the Z3 on a single gig in January 2013, then again about 8 months later. After he accompanied the band on a blizzard-laden four-show run in December 2013 both parties agreed that the collaboration was much deeper than a \u201cspecial guest\u201d situation. So Ed Mann joined the band. Now he keeps the Z3 young and hip with his table full of mallet instruments, iPads, Kaos pads and various other electro-acoustic devices.\n\nOrganist Beau Sasser and drummer Bill Carbone discovered a shared passion for Frank Zappa while touring together in the band of guitarist Melvin Sparks. They daydreamed of a trio in the organ-funk style that performed nothing but Zappa, but who would complete the triumvirate and serve as the missing-link to bridge the two genres was a mystery. When guitarist/vocalist Tim Palmieri, a diehard Zappa fan, ended up on a string of regular Wednesday night funk gigs with The Beau Sasser Trio in November 2011, the Z3 was born. The three musicians knew each other from years working in the Northeast music scene, their chemistry was undeniable, and the transition from pickup band to the Z3 was as smooth as passage of quintuplets in 9/8.\n\nThe Z3 was created for fun, and that\u2019s probably why audiences find it so enjoyable. The initial run of Z3 shows in Northampton, MA were jammed with fans of the individual musicians and of FZ, and, as the band worked toward engaging both the FZ material and the audience, the temperature has risen. The Z3 has since rocked the Blue Note Jazz Club in NYC, peppered the summer festival circuit with their Funky Takes on Frank, and delivered a legendary 3+ hour set at the Zappanale 24 festival in Bad Doberon, Germany. Give thanks for Frank!\n\nThe Z3 is:\n\nTim Palmieri (www.timpalmieri.com)\nTim Palmieri is one of the most impressive guitarists on the national music scene today. Playing with his bands Kung Fu and The Breakfast alongside artists such as moe., Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Tea Leaf Green, and Phish\u2019s Mike Gordon, the New Haven native has amassed a loyal following of obsessive fans who keep tabs on just about every note.\n\nWhile prominent in the jam scene for his aggressive and improvisational guitar style, Palmieri has grown equally comfortable behind an acoustic guitar and tours tirelessly as a solo performer. His acoustic showcases are peppered with a mix of thoughtful originals, classic covers and unexpected rarities, each of which he makes his own through a distinctive style of rhythmic looping.\n\nAt the same time, Palmieri refuses to get too comfortable as a performer and thrives on challenging himself in new ways. He has covered the entire Beatles catalogue in alphabetical order and knows a shocking number of FZ tunes among so many others. His current main project, Kung Fu, has been hailed as a modern super group.\n\nBeau Sasser (www.beausasser.com)\nBeau Sasser hit the music scene at a young age, traversing the snowy highways of Colorado for both All-State high school band gigs and shows with legends like John Denver and Jimmy Ibbotson of The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In the mid-90s Sasser headed east for a stint at Berklee College of Music and soon found himself back on the highways with the successful jamband Uncle Sammy.\n\nAround the year 2000 Sasser began performing almost exclusively on the Hammond Organ. In addition to his tenure as Melvin Sparks' preferred organist Sasser leads his own trio whose residency at Bishop's Lounge in Northampton, MA is now in its fifth year, performed for several years in the trio of Soulive\u2019s Alan Evans, and freelances like crazy.\n\nTouring throughout the United States and internationally, Beau has performed with with Maceo Parker (James Brown), Warren Haynes(Allman Brothers), Alan Evans (Soulive), Nikki Glaspie (Beyonce), Michael Feingold (Erykah Badu), Mike Keneally (Frank Zappa) and jazz greats Fareed Haque and Melvin Sparks.\n\nBill Carbone (http://www.billcarbone.com)\n\nBorn in the suburban cultural vacuum of CT, drummer Bill Carbone managed to graduate from his initial fascination with the dramatic plinkings of Rush and Yes to a broader palette of loves. Recently he\u2019s played jazz and boogaloo with guitarist Melvin Sparks, funk with organist Beau Sasser's trio, jam-rock with Max Creek and Zach Deputy, original quirky jazz-type music with the sax 4tet plus bass and drums Dead Cat Bounce, and reggae and experimental dub music with his own group Buru Style and various vocalists such as Makengo (Sierra Leone Refugee All Stars), Ajahni, Toussaint Liberator, Shasha Marley and others. As a percussionist he's tickled the Billboard charts with ROIR recording artists 10 ft Ganja Plant, graced several John Brown\u2019s Body tracks and also recorded with the founding members of Jamaica's legendary Soul Syndicate Band.\n\nCarbone is currently a PhD candidate in ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT, where he also teaches drums and steel pan while pecking away at a dissertation about gender and the Hammond Organ soul-jazz scene of the 1960s-70s. His writing has been featured in Wax Poetics, Modern Drummer, and in his bi-weekly New Haven Advocate column. He also teaches courses in ethnomusicology and world music at Central Connecticut State University.\n\nEd Mann vibes/percussion/electronics\n\nAward-winning mallet player/percussionist Ed Mann began his international professional career in 1977 when he joined Frank Zappa's band as percussionist, synthesist and background vocalist. Said to be the single-most recorded musician in the Zappa catalog, Ed performed and recorded with Zappa in electric and symphonic settings which are documented on over 35 albums from the 1977 release \"Live in New York\" through Zappa's last electric band project in 1988. During his tenure with FZ, Ed took on additional responsibilities of rehearsal director, keyboardist and electric sound designer, the latter function yielding technologically ground breaking digital music performance systems and the uniquely expressive sound set of sampled human vocalizations which characterize the social setting of Zappa's final electric band tour in 1988, as heard on the albums \"Broadway The Hard Way\", \"Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life\" and \"Make A Jazz Noise Here\".\n\nHaving released 5 critically acclaimed albums of original music, Ed has also performed and recorded with luminaries such as Don Ellis, Mark Isham, Shadowfax, Tavares, Hans Zimmer, Richie Lee Jones, Kenny Loggins, Don Preston, Bruce Fowler, Repercussion Unit, Andy Summers, Michael McDonald, Sting, Los Lobos, John Cage, Bill Eddins, the London Symphony Orchestra, Edmonton Symphony among many others and has taught and facilitated educational programs throughout the USA and Canada.", "otherInfo": "Get funky with the fellas on the music of Frank Zappa, reimagined for our tough times!\n\nTim Palmieri (Kung Fu) - guitar & vocals\nBeau Sasser (Kung Fu) - keys & vocals\nBill Carbone (Max Creek) - drums & vocals\n\nAwesome Double bill with Lo Faber & Tim Perozzi duo!"}, {"Address": "10 Theatre Alley, New York, NY 10038", "Artist": "Barbara Martinez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7952074.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.006765, 40.711508], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Alley Cat Amateur Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "B\u00e1rbara MartInez grew up performing in New York City.

His soulful, Southern gospel and rock infused voice can soar over the top of any song, and draw you in with a hushed Tom Waits whisper. Underneath his voice is the framework of the organ and keyboards which can roar like a ten ton locomotive and wrap you up like a Stevie Wonder love song. The singing and playing come together to create a complete package. What else could you need?\n\nSo when the rhythm section kicks in, it\u2019s hard to believe that you could have more funky power coming your way. But there is more! The Heavy Duty Horns, the hard charging horn section led by founder Justin Flynn, adds the the top layer of energy and excitement that makes you dance, shout, and holler.\n\nThe band draws on a solid funk and soul tradition of remakes which take hits from other musical styles and other bands and spins them into something new. Examples of this are the bands remakes of The Beatles \u201cDaytripper\u201d as a funky, dance hall tune, or an updated \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u201d that celebrates Marvin Gaye\u2019s urban cry while using the horns to up the urgency and drive home the song\u2019s message. \u201cLove The One You\u2019re With\u201d sounds fresh driven by four horns yet retains a funky 70\u2019s vibe while \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel\u201d sounds like the an alternate version right out of Michael Jackson\u2019s heyday.\n\nThe band\u2019s live sets contain these songs mixed in with their originals. This is where you\u2019ll find the band\u2019s heart and soul. Drawing from influences including Prince, Tower of Power, Joe Cocker, The Doobie Brothers, and James Brown, the band mixes a dose of latin and jazz music in to create it\u2019s own unique sound. A sound that is always funky and always makes you want to move!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Primitive Heart ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9061585.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Shoegaze, Indie, Dreamgaze, Electronic, Electro Pop, Ambient, Dream Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Primitive Heart is a synth-pop project by multi-genre producer & visual artist Dani Mari.

Whether performing with his own quartet or supporting Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett on tour, Newman\u2019s expert trumpeteering and effervescent stage presence reignited a big band scene in New York City, and has since enticed a new generation of jazz fans across the globe. The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance. His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows.

La respuesta es \u00e9l mismo, un artista que no tiene miedo a la hora de arriesgar y tomar decisiones importantes para poder vivir de lo que le gusta, la m\u00fasica.\n\nEste joven artista nacido el 28 de junio de 1986 en la ciudad de Chivilcoy, se enamor\u00f3 del rock y de la guitarra a los 8 a\u00f1os al ver un show de los Rolling Stones en Argentina. La figura de Keith Richards lo marc\u00f3 y lo llev\u00f3 a emprender un camino que sigue hasta el d\u00eda de hoy.\n\nA temprana edad, llev\u00f3 el estudio y el conocimiento de la guitarra a tal nivel que llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n de grandes personalidades del instrumento como Diego Mizrahi, que le dio un lugar en su escuela para que diera clases.\n\nPero la vida de conservatorio y de escuela no era todo para Juan, que con apetito de nuevas experiencias se lanz\u00f3 a la ruta con como dice \u00e9l \u201c3 viejos lobos del rock\u201d para poder comenzar no solo a vivir el otro lado de esta profesi\u00f3n sino para poder sentir lo que era trabajar con la m\u00fasica por primera vez. Todos los fines de semana sal\u00eda de gira por el interior del pa\u00eds con el \u00fanico objetivo de tocar y tocar.\n\nTerminada la secundaria, Juan tuvo que tomar su primera gran decisi\u00f3n: querer estudiar m\u00fasica. En sus palabras comenta \u201cNo vengo de una familia de m\u00fasicos, para nada. No puedo decir que cuando era chico escuchaba practicar a mi pap\u00e1 o a mi mam\u00e1 cantar canciones. No, no s\u00e9 lo que es eso. Por este motivo, la discusi\u00f3n con ellos sobre mi futuro, fue dif\u00edcil\u201d. Pero Juan pudo hacer entenderles a sus padres que la m\u00fasica es todo para \u00e9l, y as\u00ed aplic\u00f3 para la ITMC, una escuela terciaria de m\u00fasica ubicada en Saavedra, Buenos Aires, en donde obtuvo una beca completa por un a\u00f1o.\n\nSalir a tocar y al mismo tiempo estudiar, lo llev\u00f3 a conocer mucha gente y a tener diversas experiencia que lo llevaron a entender lo que era tocar para la gente, y para su propio ego. \u201cEntend\u00ed que un m\u00fasico arriba del escenario se tiene que entregar al 100% o por lo menos yo lo creo as\u00ed\u201d, afirma.\n\nPero como todos saben, la vida del m\u00fasico es dif\u00edcil, y mucho m\u00e1s en Argentina. Por eso, por un tiempo Juan debi\u00f3 recurrir a la herencia laboral familiar, trabajar en un banco. Durante 7 largos a\u00f1os debi\u00f3 cumplir un horario pero sin dejar atr\u00e1s su pasi\u00f3n. Mientras contaba plata detr\u00e1s de un mostrador, Juan se dio el lujo de pasar por diversas experiencias musicales, desde bandas de country y western, hasta proyectos de reggae y rock. Ha tocado en lugares m\u00edticos como el Gran Rex, abriendo para bandas como SOJA y\n\nGroundation, junto a Calican Groove, y en el Luna Park teloneando a Ivete Sangalo. Adem\u00e1s, junto a Aitor Gra\u00f1a, le abrieron el show a Manu Chao en el Estadio de Ferro.\n\nLejos de perder la motivaci\u00f3n, comenz\u00f3 a estudiar nuevamente guitarra con Pino Marrone y canto con Susana Rossi. \u201cCon ellos aprend\u00ed a ver mi instrumento y la m\u00fasica desde otra perspectiva. Mas como un pintor que como un m\u00fasico que solo toca por tocar\u201d.\n\nCon mayor confianza, lleg\u00f3 el momento en donde sus primeras composiciones empezaron a aparecer por la necesidad de sacar todo lo que ten\u00eda adentro. Y se hicieron realidad con su proyecto junto a Dami\u00e1n Chavez llamado Moos, con el cu\u00e1l grabaron su primer disco con la producci\u00f3n del gran Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez. Pero al no poder plasmar del todo su m\u00fasica, decidi\u00f3 armar un tri\u00f3 junto a Aitor Gra\u00f1a en bater\u00eda y Yulie Ruth en bajo para grabar \u201cIdas y Vueltas\u201d y \u201cBlow the Truth\u201d, sus dos primeros temas como solista.\n\nPero se avecinaba otra gran decisi\u00f3n en la historia de Juan.

Their sound is characterized by a synthesis of orchestral backing, lounge jazz, and soul; the lush orchestrations of multi-instrumentalist Dickon Hinchliffe and the smoky baritone of lead vocalist Stuart A. Staples are the band's hallmarks. Tindersticks have employed electric guitars, as most rock bands have done, but augment their instrumentation with a wide array of instruments: Rhodes piano, glockenspiel, vibraphone, violin, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, bassoon, Hammond organ, and many more are prominently utilized in the music of Tindersticks.\n\nThe band has a cult following in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, although the eclectic and unique sound Tindersticks possesses never made significant inroads in the mainstream.\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Stuart Ashton Staples, born 14 November 1965 - Lead voice, guitar, melodica\n* Dickon James Hinchliffe, born 9 July 1967 - violin, guitar, voice, piano, string and brass arrangements\n* Neil Timothy Fraser, - born 22 November 1962 - lead guitar, vibraphone\n* David Leonard Boulter, born 27 February 1965 - keyboards, percussion\n* Alasdair Robert De Villeneuve Macaulay, born 2 August 1965 - drums, percussion, trumpet\n* Mark Andrew Colwill, born 12 May 1960 - bass guitar\n\nThe band formed in late 1991, Staples, Boulter, Frazer, Macauley and Hinchcliffe having previously been members of Asphalt Ribbons. The final band line-up for the \"old horse\" mini-LP (1991) was: Stuart Staples (vocals) Dave Boulter (organ & accordion) Neil Fraser (guitar) Dickon Hinchliffe (Guitar & strings) Al Macauley (percussion & drums) John Thompson (bass). Mark Colwill was recruited when John Thompson left the Asphalt Ribbons, but it is not sure if he played any gigs under the Asphalt Ribbons name. Then they changed their name to Tindersticks after Stuart A. Staples discovered a box of German matches on a Greek beach.\n\nTindersticks started recording demo tapes in 1992, and were signed by Tippy Toe Records who released their first single, \"Patchwork\".\n\nTheir self-titled first and second albums established their signature sound and received widespread critical acclaim. Their live performances, often augmented by large string sections and even, on occasion, a full orchestra, were rapturously received. (The live album Bloomsbury Theatre 12.3.95 is a recording of one such concert.) By the time of the third album, Curtains, however, it was clear that a change of direction was called for. There was a certain ennui to the songs, and the lengthy \"Ballad of Tindersticks\" was a weary swipe at the pressures of being a touring band.\n\nThe fourth album, Simple Pleasure, lived up to its title with a series of snappy, direct songs influenced by soul music. The female backing vocals on several tracks, and the respectful cover of Odyssey's \"If You're Looking For A Way Out\", signalled the band's wish to move towards lighter, more soulful material. However, the inner sleeve's documentation of the number of takes each track went through was evidence that the band continued to adopt a painstaking approach to recording.\n\nThe fifth album, Can Our Love, continued the band's soulful direction, in particular evidence on the tender \"Sweet Release\" and in the nod to the Chi-Lites in the title of \"Chilitetime\".\n\nThe sixth and most recent album, Waiting For The Moon, was more stripped down and introspective in nature, particularly on the harrowing \"4.48 Psychosis\" (based on the play of the same name by the British playwright Sarah Kane) and \"Sometimes It Hurts\". Only the bouncy \"Just A Dog\" lightened the otherwise melancholy mood of the album.\n\nIn 2005 Staples embarked on a solo career and there was resultant speculation that the band had split. Staples has so far produced two solo albums, Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04 and Leaving Songs. The title of the second album, and Staples' notes on it, indicate that Tindersticks may indeed be at an end: \"These are songs written on the verge of leaving the things I loved and stepping into a new unknown life, both musically and personally. I was always aware that these songs were the end of something, a kind of closing a circle of a way of writing that I started so long ago and I knew I had to move on from.\"\n\nIn September 2006, the band played a one-off concert at London's Barbican Centre, performing their second album in full with a nine-member string section and two brass players, including former collaborator Terry Edwards on trumpet. This concert brought the band's members back together. A new recording process in 2007 resulted in a new album, The Hungry Saw, which was released on April 28th 2008.\n\nIn the meantime, in July 2007, Island Records had released The BBC Sessions, a double CD compilation of the band's sessions for BBC radio programmes.\n\nAs well as their six studio albums, the band has produced the soundtracks for two films by the French director Claire Denis, Nenette et Boni and Trouble Every Day.\nThey recorded a cover of the Four Tops song, \"What Is A Man\", for the theme to the British TV series The Sins.\nThe Tindersticks song Tiny Tears was featured prominently in the Series 1 episode \"Isabella\" of HBO's The Sopranos. Additionally, a version of \"Running Wild\" was played during the ending credits of the penultimate episode of the series, \"The Blue Comet\". In the Season One Finale of Brotherhood, \"El Diablo En El Ojo\" is used twice.\n\n* Tindersticks (aka First Album) (This Way Up, 1993)\n* Tindersticks (aka Second Album) (This Way Up, 1995)\n* Curtains (This Way Up, 1997)\n* Simple Pleasure (Island, 1999)\n* Can Our Love...

Since bursting on to the folk scene at the end of the Noughties, Sam Lee has blazed a trail as an outstanding singer and song collector. He\u2019s also been the driving force behind the eclectic, award-winning folk club The Nest Collective, which has brought traditional music to all kinds of new stages and venues, as well as the founder of a burgeoning song collectors\u2019 movement that inspires a new generation of performers to draw on living source singers rather than books and records. Lee is a 21st-century artist, collecting new versions of old songs on his iPhone and laptop, but his repertoire is steeped in the reek and smoke of folk history and lore, its tales of love, parting, exile and murder bound by a sympathetic magic still resonant today, parting the veil on vivid scenes from our islands\u2019 deep history. Awarded the 2011 Arts Foundation prize and nominated for the 2012 Mercury Award for his debut album, \u2018Ground Of Its Own\u2019, he has taken his music worldwide to more than 20 countries, appeared in \u2018Peaky Blinders\u2019 on TV, and joined The Unthanks to commemorate the Great War at the Barbican in London. Lee reached an even larger audience with his performance of \u2018The Tan Yard Side\u2019 to the accompaniment of a nightingale on Radio 4 on 19 May 2014. This remarkable recording marked the 90th anniversary of the first-ever outside broadcast of \u2018Singing with the Nightingales\u2019 by cellist Beatrice Harrison on 19 May 1924. Sam Lee and his band comprise cellist Francesca Ter-Berg, trumpeter Steve Chadwick, violinist Flora Curzon, percussionist Josh Green and koto player Jonah Brody. They entered Imogen Heap\u2019s Hideaway Studio in Essex with Penguin Cafe\u2019s Arthur Jeffes and Jamie Orchard-Lisle as co-producers, and spent three months laying down tracks and layering music for Sam\u2019s new album, The Fade In Time. \u201cThere were a huge amount of toys and instruments to play with at Imogen's,\u201d says Lee. \u201cWe had these tools at hand, a lot of percussion, big drums. We didn't go in with an agenda. It was taking the live band and seeing how we could expand on that, layering the strings to make it more orchestral, thickening up the brass.\u201d Impassioned and hugely ambitious in scope, The Fade In Time is a major statement from an artist and group extending the borders of their music beyond its national boundaries to encompass Bollywood beats, Polynesian textures and contemporary classical music. From the blaring brass and martial drums of opening track, Johnnie O the Brine through to the softly closing account of The Moss House, with just Sam\u2019s voice and Arthur Jeffes\u2019 beautifully minimalist, elegant piano, the instrumental textures and vocals \u2013augmented by the Roundhouse Choir on Lovely Molly \u2013 make The Fade In Time a distinctive and radical reinterpretation of the British folk tradition. Several of its songs, including opener Johnnie O the Brine, were learnt from Lee\u2019s mentor, Stanley Robertson. It\u2019s a tale of hunting, poaching, slaughter and magic, and to form its soundscape, \u201cI wanted something with rhythm, punch and drama to it,\u201d says Lee. \u201cI heard this tarantella approach, and the horns are hunting horns, inspired by Tajikistan wedding bands, spattering and spitting out these sounds. They\u2019re characters in the song,\u201d he adds, \u201crecreating this world of the green wood.\u201d Lee recalls Robertson taking him to Monymusk in Aberdeenshire, where the story took place \u2013 its hero and his dogs in slumber after drinking the blood of the venison, and the sound of the foresters approaching. \u201cThe connection I had, knowing where it came from, the hunting of the deer, the communion of drinking the blood,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt has such poetry and romance.\u201d Also from Robertson comes the great ballad, Lord Gregory. Lee\u2019s version begins with an archive recording of Hamish Henderson with the singer Charlotte Higgins, an elder cousin of Robertson\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s an old song, old and a long, long time ago\u2019 says Higgins as Henderson coaxes the words from her, and you realise you\u2019re putting an ear to something ancient, stories thought extinct but found alive and well in your own backyard. \u201cStanley learnt it from his mother, who recited it as a poem,\u201d says Lee. \u201cHe\u2019s condensed it with absolutely everything there is about rejection, love, conviction, forgiveness, empathy and compassion. It\u2019s the song I\u2019m most proud of, singing-wise. That\u2019s the one I\u2019m emotionally most connected to. It\u2019s the centre of the album.\u201d Poignantly, The Moon Shone By My Bed Last Night, was the last song Robertson taught Lee. \u201cIt was the last song he\u2019d learnt from his aunt, the great singer Jeannie Robertson,\u201d says Lee. \u201cOne day Stanley said to me, I want to teach you a song, and that was the one. It holds a very special place for me.\u201d A classic song with its own special place in the tradition is The Blackbird, recast here with propulsive piano, strong percussion and a wall of brass. \u201cThis is one of two songs on the album that I didn\u2019t collect,\u201d says Sam. \u201cIt comes from May Bradley, a gypsy singer from Shropshire who was recorded in the 1950s. \u201cShe has this amazing modal tune for it, unlike anyone else\u2019s. And lyrically, hers is so much more punchy and tenacious \u2013 about loving this soldier, being pregnant, being cast out by her community \u2013 \u2018Let them go talking say what they will, while there\u2019s breath in my body I\u2019ll love my lad still\u2019 \u2013 I just love that conviction.\u201d The powerful, condensed version of the famous Napoleonic song Bonny Bunch of Roses comes from Freda Black, an octogenarian gypsy singer Sam has visited many times on the Hampshire-Sussex borders. As Lord Gregory began with the voices of Henderson and Higgins, so Bonny Bunch begins with an archive recording, an Eastern European cantor singer from whom Sam takes the lead as the band rises with a driving fife and drum accompaniment. These and Lee\u2019s own field recordings have a key role on the album.

From the sold out shows and billboards lining the streets of Europe to infinite releases on some of the globe\u2019s leading dance labels, we\u2019ve got the goods on Gil. Enlisting his roots in the open format world, Gil had a light bulb moment with house music that lit up his profile. At the top of his game, his resonation with pioneering talent like EDX, Oliver Heldens, Nora En Pure was obvious and he met his match! Serious with his craft, Gil is a legitimately trained musician (no he doesn\u2019t just press buttons) having studied a spectrum of music theory, business and production at the New York University- Clive Davis School of Recorded Music, giving him a well-endowed lead in the industry. Signing music across Sirup Music, Enormous Chills, No Definition and more, Gil\u2019s drive for dance-floor ready monsters is evident. Gaining global support from Tiesto, Don Diablo, Sam Feldt and a plethora of other boss icons in electronic music, there is no lying about the 300k+ Spotify streams and Beatport top 100 records, lining five up under his belt including \u2018Can\u2019t Let You Go\u2019 via Dirty Soul, where Bakermat and MK also hold high regard. At the clubs, on the stage, the dance floors, the pool parties and more, Gil isn\u2019t shy of a an enviable show. From sold out headlining shows to residencies across the US, it has lead him to global tours around the world including Australia, Europe, Asia and main slots at Exit Festival Serbia for 60,000+ people. On the back of this, the World Club Dome Festival in Frankfurt lit up while the hottest summer parties in Ibiza and the Greek Islands (Mykonos) alongside David Guetta and Tiesto and he even had the opportunity to play back to back with Martin Garrix, Calvin Harris, Marshmello and Kygo have been standouts. Holding high regard in electronic music and a resume of milestones, the only other thing you need to know right now is Gil Glaze has two upcoming tracks set to be his best work yet and a blazing summer ahead, so stay tuned.
