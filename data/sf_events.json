Charming. Unstoppable. America first became acquainted with the Country music trio Restless Road while watching Season 3 of The X Factor USA and these are just some of the words that immediately came to their minds. The breakout act didn\u2019t just leave a lasting impression on audiences, but also mesmerized the show\u2019s judges including Simon Cowell and Kelly Rowland. \"X Factor\" of course refers to that undefinable and innate \"something\" that a star simply embodies. And fans and tastemakers recognize that Restless Road has got it times three. Zach Beeken (22), Garrett Nichols (21) and Jared Keim (24) each bring their own \u201cAll- American\u201d experience to a transformed Restless Road. Evident in their self-taught musical skills, these three guys do share one important thing in common above all else: determination. Zach\u2019s very first job was pollinating corn on a farm in Iowa where he discovered his love for Country music and taught himself how to sing. Garrett on the other hand, grew up in Alabama and was involved in everything from school musicals to baseball. One day at age 12 though, he picked up an acoustic guitar and never looked back. Also at a young age, Jared\u2019s community watched in awe as he performed on stage at his local church in Missouri; he found his calling before he could tie his own shoes. Into his teens, Jared trained himself on the guitar, piano and drums. \u201cGetting together to write or record is great because we all grew up with the same hard- working attitude and approach our music in the same way together,\u201d says Zach. It\u2019s this dedication and positive outlook that\u2019s responsible for so much of the group\u2019s success. One of Restless Road\u2019s biggest accomplishments to date is landing at #1 on the iTunes Country Chart. With a Country spin, the group covered one of the most popular songs of 2013, Avicii\u2019s \u201cWake Me Up,\u201d and quickly realized that they had a growing and passionate fan base to satisfy. One of these fans was legendary music manager Johnny Wright. Wright has helped launch Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC and Jonas Brothers (to name a few), so he thoroughly understands what it takes for a group of guys to be successful and began working with Restless Road in 2014. With Wright\u2019s ear for talent and Restless Road\u2019s capability, this Country \u201cman band\u201d (as they refer to themselves) was ready to show the world what they could do and took their live show on the road in 2015. The group has since toured nationwide, secured a coveted performance slot during NASCAR\u2019s AAA Texas 500 Weekend at Texas Motor Speedway in Ft. Worth, brought down the house at Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Draper James fashion line launch party, opened up for songstress Demi Lovato and contributed their talents to an annual Country Music Hall of Fame fundraiser event. Jared sums it up well by explaining, \u201cWe\u2019re three guys who have something to prove. We love what we're doing, we're real and we're going to carve out a place in music history for ourselves.\u201d 3 guys who love singing country music.

The breakout act didn\u2019t just leave a lasting impression on audiences, but also mesmerized the show\u2019s judges including Simon Cowell and Kelly Rowland. \"X Factor\" of course refers to that undefinable and innate \"something\" that a star simply embodies. And fans and tastemakers recognize that Restless Road has got it times three. Zach Beeken (22), Garrett Nichols (21) and Jared Keim (24) each bring their own \u201cAll- American\u201d experience to a transformed Restless Road. Evident in their self-taught musical skills, these three guys do share one important thing in common above all else: determination. Zach\u2019s very first job was pollinating corn on a farm in Iowa where he discovered his love for Country music and taught himself how to sing. Garrett on the other hand, grew up in Alabama and was involved in everything from school musicals to baseball. One day at age 12 though, he picked up an acoustic guitar and never looked back. Also at a young age, Jared\u2019s community watched in awe as he performed on stage at his local church in Missouri; he found his calling before he could tie his own shoes. Into his teens, Jared trained himself on the guitar, piano and drums. \u201cGetting together to write or record is great because we all grew up with the same hard- working attitude and approach our music in the same way together,\u201d says Zach. It\u2019s this dedication and positive outlook that\u2019s responsible for so much of the group\u2019s success. One of Restless Road\u2019s biggest accomplishments to date is landing at #1 on the iTunes Country Chart. With a Country spin, the group covered one of the most popular songs of 2013, Avicii\u2019s \u201cWake Me Up,\u201d and quickly realized that they had a growing and passionate fan base to satisfy. One of these fans was legendary music manager Johnny Wright. Wright has helped launch Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC and Jonas Brothers (to name a few), so he thoroughly understands what it takes for a group of guys to be successful and began working with Restless Road in 2014. With Wright\u2019s ear for talent and Restless Road\u2019s capability, this Country \u201cman band\u201d (as they refer to themselves) was ready to show the world what they could do and took their live show on the road in 2015. The group has since toured nationwide, secured a coveted performance slot during NASCAR\u2019s AAA Texas 500 Weekend at Texas Motor Speedway in Ft. Worth, brought down the house at Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Draper James fashion line launch party, opened up for songstress Demi Lovato and contributed their talents to an annual Country Music Hall of Fame fundraiser event. Jared sums it up well by explaining, \u201cWe\u2019re three guys who have something to prove. We love what we're doing, we're real and we're going to carve out a place in music history for ourselves.\u201d 3 guys who love singing country music.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "\u25aa\ufe0fABOUT THE SERIES\n\"All Dressed Up & Nowhere to Show\" is a virtual concert series presented by SPACE.

His second album, Misguided Roses, spawned I'll Be, a major single in 1998. Two more albums (Messenger and Far From Over) followed, but at the end of 2001, he split from Lava. In 2003 he released a collection of acoustic versions of songs both old and new called The Austin Sessions via ATC Records, a Nashville-based independent record label (at which McCain was the first artist signed following its creation in 2001). Mid-2004 saw the arrival of his first studio album in three years, entitled Scream & Whisper, which was released on another indie label, DRT Entertainment.\n\nHe has released two DVDs to date. The first was through ATC records in late 2002, called Mile Marker: Songs and Stories from the Acoustic Highway, and it consisted of interviews, live performances, and other material. The other was in late 2004, Tinsel & Tap Shoes. It was his first live concert DVD, recorded at The House of Blues in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nA new CD was released in April, 2006 titled, Lost in America.

Sara has previously been featured at Variety, Huffington Post, Yahoo! Music, PopMatters, Magnet Magazine, the homepage of Apple Music, and more. She\u2019s appeared in numerous films and TV shows, including The Wonder Years and Frasier, while her songs have been featured in Grey\u2019s Anatomy and in a national Chevy campaign. Sara has shared the stage with Ben Folds, Juliana Hatfield, Ben Lee, Inara George, Neil Halstead, and Lissie, and provided backing vocals for Moby on The Tonight Show and for The Dandy Warhols and Mojave 3 on KCRW\u2019s Morning Becomes Eclectic.\n\nWild & Precious Life was co-produced by Melson, multi-instrumentalist/guitarist Danny Hechter (Badflower, Jordan McGraw) and Rick Parker (Lord Huron, Joseph Arthur, BRMC, Jeremy & The Harlequins). Hechter brought in bassists Sean Sobash (Dominic Fike) and Nick Diiorio (Jordan McGraw), drummer Jonas Streffer, second guitarist Jake Faun, and violinist Koi Anunta (Jules Galli). Violinist Kerenza Peacock (Adele) also added to the recordings, with additional production and remixing by Eric Breiner of PeachMusicLA.\n\nWritten and performed on piano and guitar, Sara\u2019s songs reflect on hard-won lessons and her tireless journey toward self-acceptance. \u201cIt\u2019s high time I learn to love myself before I\u2019m dead,\u201d she sings in the soulful and heartfelt \u201cComing Out\u201d \u2014 a defiant, weary, and yet serene \u201cI-don\u2019t-give-a-f-ck\u201d anthem for anyone who is ready to shed the mask and step fully into one\u2019s authentic self. \u201cState of Ease,\" written in deep meditation, is a prayer for transcendence \u2014 the quest to maintain a state of equanimity in the face of life\u2019s challenges. \u201cNo one can escape pain, physical or emotional,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we choose to react.\u201d Ethereal and swelling vocals, haunting piano, and swirling guitar lines evoke the bliss of flight, peace and surrender. \u201cSame River\u201d, inspired by the quote from Greek philosopher Heraclitus, No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river, and he's not the same man, is a reminder that the only constant is change -- in the fleeting, morphing moment.\n\nWith classical training at the age of eight, Sara began to gravitate toward the melancholy darkness of Chopin and the fanciful romanticism of Debussy. The daughter of two professors, she grew up in an intellectual Jewish household in a small college town in Indiana. Surrounded by cows and cornfields, her parents\u2019 home was an oasis of culture and worldliness, with books lining the shelves from floor to ceiling, and the best record collection in the neighborhood.\n\nShe graduated from Harvard with an English degree and initially moved out West to become an actor. However, after one too many traumatizing \u201c#MeToo\u201d encounters, Sara went \u201con strike,\u201d as she puts it. \u201cI just refused to go out on any more meetings or auditions. I lived on residuals for a while and spent all day playing guitar and piano, and writing songs. That was when I decided I was going to take that turn from the acting into music. It\u2019s not like that stuff doesn\u2019t exist in the music industry, because it does; but at least you have creative control. You can stand behind a finished product \u2014 your song \u2014 and not have to rely solely on what you look like, or your perceived value, or lack thereof, as a sexual object.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief marriage to Justin Webb, son of famed songwriter Jimmy Webb, the loss of a pregnancy at five months, and an ensuing divorce, Sara struggled with depression, and turned to yoga for salvation, developing a serious daily practice that began to inform her songwriting with new revelations about surrender, acceptance, growth and change. It also slowed her anxious breath to a fluid wave. \u201cYoga is like peeling an onion, gradually removing layers that cover up your true essence. There may be some tears in the process, but it\u2019s delicious, good for you, and worth it.\u201d\n\nThe EP reflects Sara\u2019s spiritual seeking, a deep understanding of her own mortality, and an urgency to make the most of life while she\u2019s here. \u201cWalk Softly\u201d is a plaintive letter of life instructions, penned to herself, invoking the perspective of her older, wiser self advising its younger, more distracted and insecure counterpart: \u201cPlease be gentle, please be kind; you can\u2019t read anybody\u2019s mind. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through. So don\u2019t be quick to your defense, \u2018cause we all hide behind pretense; and it\u2019s got nothing to do with you.\" Title track \u201cWild & Precious Life\u201d inspired by the line in the Mary Oliver poem, The Summer Day (\u201cTell me, What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?\u201d) is a rousing, anthemic call to fulfill one\u2019s full potential, despite the naysayers.\n\nSara will tour in support of the new EP, both solo and with a stripped-down version of her beloved band. She muses that, just as one can never step into the same river twice, her shows take on different forms. \u201cThere is a power in connecting one-on-one with an audience that is its own special magic,\u201d Sara says. \u201cHearing my songs come to life around me with a full band is euphoric. They\u2019re two different experiences, both for me and for the audience, and I live for both.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": [-122.23, 37.732], "Artist": "Aaron Goodvin LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/2999240.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.23, 37.732], "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aaron Goodvin\u2019s new Warner Music Canada / Reviver Records release \u2014 V \u2014 is available now.

LaRue is known for his real life, thinking man\u2019s music.\n\nUS TIME is a collection of songs from the native Texan who now resides in Oklahoma reflecting on his own dreams that openly shares with his longtime fans. \u201cThis project is a tribute to my fans. We have developed a strong relationship and I appreciate all of them,\u201d says LaRue. \u201c Together, we have built a compilation of fan favorites from the live shows that reflect the complexion of our time together in music, it is simply our US Time, \u201c he continues. This sentiment rings even louderafter LaRue took a hiatus from touring this summer to re-center his life that seemed to be lost.\n\nLaRue says, \u201cBeing able to record such timeless songs as \u201cEmpty Glass,\u201d \u201cInto the Mystic\u201d and \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d aside some of original tunes, all selected by my fans make me feel validated as an artist and hopefully it gives the fans exactly what they are looking for.\u201d\n\nBeing able to connect with fans the way we can today is mind blowing to LaRue. When this journey started over 15 years ago, communication was restricted mainly to the stage, written letters and before show meet and greets. Today\u2019s instant social media connection is what helped generate this collection of songs. \u201cI just kept a list of songs that fans would either request via Twitter and Facebook or yell to me on stage,\u201d says LaRue. \u201cUs Time is a very collaborative effort with them. Also, having RS Fields as the producer on this project was a good call. This is our first time working together and he totally nailed the production and we totally were in sync on how it should sound. I am very happy with the end result, it feels live and it feels real, and that is what music is all about,\u201d he continued.\n\nIndependently charged, LaRue has sold over 300,000 records over his career and plays 200-plus shows a year.

Like a picture perfect painting, Wills\u2019 music is a vocal work of art that walks right off the canvas and into the hearts of country music lovers alike.\n\nBringing the Wills\u2019 dimension to some of the greatest songs ever written, he\u2019s not necessarily become known for being trendy, hip or even on the cutting edge, but rather and simply as a damn good singer!\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a good storyteller to make a son g meaningful. Whether romantic or \u2018reality,\u2019 my focus is on the music delivery to make it my own for the people who listen\u2014so that they can make it their own.\u201d\n\nAnd the people listen...\n\nHis list of accolades is his testament. Mark Wills is a multi-platinum selling country music star with eight top 10 hits to his name including \u201c19 Something,\u201d \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Laugh At Me;\u201d all of which received nominations for Single, Song and Video of the Year by the Country Music Association. Wills won the Academy of Country\nMusic's award for Top New Male Vocalist in 1998. In 2002, his single \u201c19 Something\u201d spent six consecutive weeks at No. 1, was Billboard\u2019s top country hit of the year and was the second most-played song of the decade in 2009.\n\n\u2026and that\u2019s just a chapter in Mark Wills\u2019 life story.\n\nSince garnering his Top New Male Vocalist recognition in 1998, Wills has become a staple in country music, like salt and pepper on a table; the chapters may have changed, but the story continues. The father of two daughters, a husband and the head of household, Mark\u2019s role in life and music are one in the same.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019ve seen all sides of me! I\u2019ve become more aware of who I am not only as an artist, but as a father, a husband and a friend\u2026and as a dad, I want to put out music my children can listen to; all in all, I take more ownership in it.\u201d\n\nHis ownership is made evident in his newest collection of recordings on the CD entitled LOOKING FOR AMERICA; an assortment of tunes Mark describes as different, yet the same.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA is a project with no \u2018sacrifices.\u2019 With titles like \u201cSmoking Gun,\u201d \u201cWhere Did I Lose You,\u201d \u201cA Whole World\u201d and \u201cRocking The Country,\u201d the tracks are not just about a rhyme and a hook, they\u2019re a menagerie of people-stories--a musical exhibition of heart-heavy, romantic, comedic all-American existence with apple pie flavor. Describing the hue of the music, Wills colors his music \u201cdark blue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of many personalities with a lot that I want to say. There\u2019s a fun, down-home side of me, and then there\u2019s an emotional, serious side. I think LOOKING FOR AMERICA, topically, is a human interest story of love, tragedy and life\u2019s unexpected.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has ever seen him in concert, or has met with him personally, knows that inside this humble, good ol' boy, country singer dwells a soul who just wants to speak to and for all with his music. LOOKING FOR AMERICA delivers music with a no-holds-barred edge softened with a trademarked tenor vocal that will capture the attention of music lovers from every genre from first cut to last.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA clearly raises the flag to demonstrate the responsibility he feels to Americans alike, and specifically our military, with the title cut and \u201cCrazy Being Home.\u201d\n\nWills has made more seven trips to entertain our troops; he is familiar with the places they\u2019ve been. His trips have taken him to Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. He has also performed at several events for the Champions for Champions Organization, the USO\nand a variety of Fallen Soldier Charities here in the U.S. Having become personally acquainted with the faces of our brothers and sisters of the military, LOOKING FOR AMERICA is dedicated in part to these brave individuals.\n\n\"First of all, it's a privilege to provide a little joy and entertainment for these people. The first time I went, it was a life-changing experience. The freedom that we have is not something that I take for granted--they're literally giving their lives for us. By playing a show for them or releasing a song that shares their emotional story, it\u2019s my way, however minimal, to say \u2018Thank You.\u2019\u201d\n\nSupporting our troops is just one of a number of philanthropic endeavors Mark Wills dedicates his time and effort to. He has aligned with USA Cares to launch a national awareness campaign surrounding the severity of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Since 2007, Mark has been the\nspokesperson for the Children\u2019s Miracle Network and its annual celebrations.\n\nAs an active representative, he accompanies miracle children to Walt Disney World and then to Washington each year as part of a national awareness campaign; the children enjoy lunch with Congress and a trip to the White House to meet with the President.\n\nTurning the page from bringing all-American music to life to his own brush with death, Wills was caught by surprise by an unexpected, eye-opening crisis. In October 2010, Mark experienced what felt like a \u201cpoke\u201d in his side that was followed by flu-like symptoms. A visit to the doctor took him straight to the emergency room. \u201cThe nurse said, \u2018we have to admit you immediately,\u2019 I said, \u2018I need to go home to let the girls know,\u2019 her response to me was, \u2018You don\u2019t have the time.\u201d Mark suffered from an intestinal infection that could have taken his life, but he pulled through with a nine-inch long scar to remind him of its value.\n\n\u201cIt was a dire circumstance and it gave me a whole new perspective in all aspects of my life.\u201d\n\nA man whose appetite for life surpasses what most people can only dream of \u2013 a dedicated parent, philanthropist, outdoorsman, jokester \u2013 but, more than anything, else Mark Wills is an artist and, behind the artist, is an even better singer.\n\n\u201cWhen the story comes to \u2018The End,\u2019 I just want to be remembered as a great singer - who sang great songs \u2013 and used his talents to not only speak to people but was the voice for many.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": [-122.23, 37.732], "Artist": "AHI LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6472095.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.23, 37.732], "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Alternative, Alt-folk, Indie Soul, R&b, Soul, R&b/soul, Indie, Rnb-soul", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With a voice like \u201cgravel on silk\u201d, indie-soul/alt-folk songwriter AHI (pronounced \u201ceye\u201d) is a rare talent with the keen ability to deliver a story with the ease and familiarity of an old friend. Favouring passion over precision, it's easy to see why comparisons to Richie Havens, Ray LaMontagne and Tracy Chapman are common for this soulful troubadour. From humble beginnings in Brampton, Ontario, AHI independently toured over 100,000 miles, through the vast woodlands of Canada and the neon lights of Nashville, to the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and eventually beyond the Atlantic to the brick lanes of London. Along the way, he has recorded with leading acoustic sessions across the UK and Europe, but none has been more viewed than a simple home video of his stunning rendition of Bob Marley\u2019s \u2018No Woman No Cry\u2019, filmed in a London alleyway and accompanied by the sweet harmonies of his three-year-old daughter. The video caught the attention of the Marley family who featured it on the official BobMarley.com website and sent AHI a personalized note from Mrs. Rita Marley herself \u2013 an unparalleled experience for an artist who cites Bob Marley as his greatest musical inspiration. Soon after, AHI returned to find his Indie Soul EP (2014) was chosen one of CBC Radio One\u2019s top 10 records of the year, and he has since been recognized and awarded by Folk Alliance International, Nashville Songwriters Association International, the Songwriters Association of Canada, and the Canada Council for the Arts, among others. For his debut full-length We Made It Through The Wreckage (2017), AHI has collaborated with CMA winning producer Eric Masse (Miranda Lambert) to create what Masse has called an entirely \"new genre\", blending folk, soul and rock, and topping it off with a vocal performance to be expected from a seasoned powerhouse rather than an indie debut. The feel-good single Ol' Sweet Day broke the Billboard Spotify Viral 50 Chart and hit #34 on the U.S. Viral 50 without any promotion or marketing. The track took off on playlists worldwide and surpassed 1 million streams; a rare feat for an artist yet to make his mark. Now a 2017 finalist in the Allan Slaight JUNO Master Class, it\u2019s not hard to see why AHI is one of Canada\u2019s most promising emerging acts.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What! The Good, the Mad, and the Ugly\u201d, an edited compilation of the band\u2019s fan club magazine spanning 10 years from 1994 to 2004.\n\nAnd still the \u2018Madly In Anger With The World\u2019 tour continued, selling out venues right through to it\u2019s final date in San Jose, California on November 29, 2004.\n\nThey did publicly state that the majority of 2005 would be spent re-charging those creative and mental batteries, and true to their word it was a quiet year, except for two little hometown gigs with the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in November.

Along with performing, the guitarist has a Doctorate of Musical Arts from the University of Southern California, and balances his time between playing live and teaching at places like Musician's Institute, Chaffey College, and Saddleback College.\n\nA native of Portland, Oregon, Hawley started playing music at age eight, first taking piano lessons per his mother's request, and then adding guitar lessons a year later. As a teenager, he played in church, toured with a bluegrass ensemble, and led his own blues band. Also during high school, a friend made him a mixtape which included George Benson's 1976 hit song \"Breezin',\" and ignited his enduring love of contemporary jazz. In 2002, he relocated to Los Angeles where he attended the University of Southern California, eventually earning his Bachelor's, Master's, and doctorate degrees in music. Since graduating, he has played in a variety of live and studio settings with a bevy of pop, jazz, and R&B artists including Natalie Cole, Jennifer Lopez, Dave Koz, Brian Culbertson, Rick Braun, Gerald Albright, Manhattan Transfer, Peabo Bryson, Euge Groove, and many more.\n\nAlthough he had originally planned to record a solo album in 2005, the abundance of live and session opportunities kept him busy. It also afforded him time to build a strong following, and in 2015 he signed with Kalimba Records. A year later, he released his full-length debut Just the Beginning, which featured guest appearances by Culberson, Albright, Groove, Eric Darius, and Michael Lington. The album performed well, producing three number one hits including \"35th St.,\" which spent five weeks on top of the Billboard Smooth Jazz Chart.

In more ways than one.\n\n\"We love to expose people to sounds they might not have heard before,\" explains violinist and bandleader Chris McKhool, summarizing the mission statement of the ground-breaking and acclaimed world music ensemble. \"And we love collaborating with other artists.\"\n\nOver the past dozen years and six albums, McKhool and his bandmates \u2014 co-founding guitarist Kevin Lalibert\u00e9, bassist Drew Birston, Cuban percussionist Rosendo \u2018Chendy\u2019 Leon and second guitarist Eddie Paton \u2014 have excelled at both. Thrilling listeners around North America with their genre-hopping fusion of Celtic reels, flamenco, Gypsy jazz, Arabic, Cuban, and South Asian rhythms, Sultans of String celebrate diversity and creativity with warmth and virtuosity. And they often do it with artists such as Paddy Moloney and The Chieftains, Richard Bona, Benoit Bourque (Bottine Souriante), Nikki Yanofsky, Alex Cuba, Ruben Blades, Crystal Shawanda and Ken Whiteley.\n\nWith their historic and visionary seventh album Refuge (coming in 2020), McKhool and co. bring their unique brand of musical synergy and collaboration into the studio like never before. Their most ambitious, diverse, inclusive and passionately political album, Refuge puts the Toronto-based Sultans face-to-face with a VIP roster of artists from around the globe \u2014 including American banjo master Bela Fleck, Israeli vocalist Yasmin Levy and others, like Iraqi violinist Imah Al Taha and Iranian santur master Amir Amiri, who have fled the peril and persecution of their homelands for the safer shores of North America.\n\n\"This is a project that is centred around the positive contributions of refugees and new immigrants to U.S.A. and Canada,\" says McKhool, whose Lebanese grandfather stowed away on a ship bound for North America a century ago. \"We are bringing in special guests that are newcomers to this land, as well as global talents that have been ambassadors for peace. We wish to celebrate the successes of those who make the journey here, and bring their extraordinary talents with them. We hope that the kinds of conversations we can have as musicians can provide a model for peace that our politicians and citizens find inspiration from.\"\n\nThat inspiration could not be summed up more clearly than on Refuge's gorgeously evocative and powerful first single I Am a Refugee, co-starring Somali poet and multi-media artist Ifrah Mansour, who now makes her home in the Twin Cities. \"I wrote the poem for me, for my community, and for those that are yearning for change, those yearning to deepen their empathy,\" explains Mansour. \"Writing the poem was a way to unleash some pain that I could name finally \u2013 I wrote it because I was so frustrated with so many people sending me emails and asking me what I thought about the travel ban, the first time our American government here shared the first travel ban. And that an artist\u2019s job is to draw that hope, especially in a time of deep hopelessness.\"\n\nLike most of the collaborations on Refuge, I Am a Refugee came to life in the studio, with Sultans of String and their guests composing and creating together. But no matter how they began, they all ended the same: with all the artists recording together at Jukasa, a world-class recording facility on the Six Nations reserve between Toronto and Buffalo.\n\n\"We knew we had to do it this way,\" McKhool stresses. \"We couldn't make an album honouring refugees and do it long-distance. But having everyone in the room at the same time made it extremely challenging, both from a logistical and technical standpoint. But the results certainly made it worthwhile.\"\n\nOf course, Sultans of String have never taken the easy road. Since releasing their debut album Luna in 2007, they have continually strived to make each chart-topping album more original and meaningful than the last. That includes working with an orchestra (2013's Symphony), teaming with Pakistani sitarist Anwar Khurshid (2015's Subcontinental Drift) and even crafting a world-music holiday album (2017's Christmas Caravan), which landed them on the Billboard charts and the New York Times. Their ambition and work ethic have garnered them multiple awards and accolades, including three Juno nominations, first place in the International Songwriting Competition (out of 15,000 entries), three Canadian Folk Music Awards, and countless other honours.\n\nTheir live resum\u00e9 is similarly stellar. Equally at home in a concert hall, jazz club or festival setting, the Sultans have gigged at the legendary club Birdland in New York, the renowned Celtic Connections Festival in the U.K. and the San Jose Jazz Festival. They have performed with symphonies across Canada and the U.S., and played live on BBC TV, Irish National Radio, World Cafe and SiriusXM in Washington. No matter the venue, the goal is the same, McKhool says.\n\n\"I've always wanted our concerts to be a place where everyone feels welcome. I want to reach out to diverse communities to say, 'Come out and enjoy music with us \u2014 you're going to have a really good time.' And it's great to see people from, say, the South Asian community mixed in with the hipster crowd. Or to play some very small towns where they might not have heard a sitar played live before. It benefits society as a whole, to have people from around the world blending their ideas, mixing their cultures.\"\n\nAnd sharing the wealth.", "otherInfo": "https://www.facebook.com/cdnmusician\nChris McKhool live stream interview with Canadian Music Magazine\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Andrew King, featuring slides, video clips from our new project, and stories about how this exceptional album came to be. \u201cRefuge is a fantastic, moving, dreamlike, epic, timely album.\u201d \u2013 Ken Micallef (Jazz Times, Stereophile, Downbeat)"}, {"Address": [-122.23, 37.732], "Artist": "Sam Buckingham ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8974078.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.23, 37.732], "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Pop, Folk", "Time": "10:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWinsome songs delivered with empathic delicacy\u201d - Rolling Stone\n\n\"Gorgeous and moving... with an authenticity that is undeniable\" - The Au Review\n\nAfter an impressive 18 months since releasing her acclaimed album \u201cThe Water\u201d singer-songwriter sweetheart Sam Buckingham hits the road, touring for the first time with her band, bringing the album to life and premiering a swag of gorgeous new songs.\n\nRecorded over just one week in a converted horse stable on the NSW south coast, \u201cThe Water\u201d has seen Buckingham tour alongside Kasey Chambers, James Reyne, Jordie Lane and Diesel, showcase at Nashville\u2019s renowned \u201cAmericanafest\" and embark on three national sellout tours of her own.\n\nAn audio journal of sorts, Buckingham penned the majority of the album while living in Latin America.

Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN.

You did? Boy oh boy.\n\nThe metronome reference was but a musical in-joke before: now it contains more meaning. The steady tick-tocking of the pendulum represents continuation, stability, endlessness, and consistent familiarity. It understands that while we all ultimately return to the goo from whence we came, time marches on furiously, like a bull aiming for a matador. Your last breath will be another click on the machine.\n\nMetronomy Forever in name represents a similar ethos: something looking backwards and forwards simultaneously, like Janus, something fated and eternal. You were made from dust and to dust you will return, that sort of thing.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is when you\u2019re making music and you enter a world where you have achieved some sort of celebrity no matter how large or small you start to think about yourself in terms of legacy and what you\u2019re going to leave behind,\u201d says Mount. \u201cAnd then you realise that\u2019s limited to the interest people have in you. In the end I feel completely comfortable with it. The less importance you place in any art the more interesting it can become in a way\u2026 I\u2019m making music, I\u2019m going to do some concerts, I need to feed my children.\u201d\n\nMetronomy Forever is the follow-up to 2016\u2019s Summer 08, and contains 17 tracks. Its length is born from a desire for breathing room, from not wanting to stuff the hits together like a bouquet of petrol station roses. In between the sauna-sweat-soaked funk of songs like It\u2019s Automatic, and the beach funeral of Walking In The Dark, lie pretty, glistening ambient tracks. It evokes the feeling of being sat in a nursing home, Swiss-cheese-brained, recalling joyous flashes of a past life while the fugue states of comforting confusion wash over you.\n\nIt also comes from a desire to replicate the feeling of listening to the radio, with sumptuous songs of different types and styles helping lighten your mood, and stifle retches as you inhale scrambled egg steam from the saucepan you\u2019re scrubbing. \u201cThe radio never stops,\u201d as Joe puts it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how emotionally deep the music that comes on is, it\u2019s entirely your situation that gives the music it\u2019s emotional leaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I was concentrating on trying to make these snappy songs, and when they were all sat together it didn\u2019t make for some impressive thing. It wasn\u2019t until I started thinking about the past several years, realising that in that time there\u2019ve been periods of drifting, and looking around for ideas. When I started including these bits of instrumental music and bits of sound, to which I genuinely felt some kind of connection, I put them in amongst these little flowers.\u201d\n\nFlowers are apt metaphor. Mount has moved away from the bustle of his former Parisian home to take up residence atop a hill in the garden of England. It was a necessary change, he says, and one that has soldered a bond with him and nature.\n\n\u201cI think it has everything to do with me at the moment, being in this environment \u2013 and I literally mean the environment. I feel properly more connected with nature. And I\u2019m embracing myself getting into it, because I think it\u2019s a really important part of being a person \u2013 and I haven\u2019t even read that Sapiens book.\u201d\n\nAnd a good thing he hasn\u2019t, as it seems Sapiens has been widely discredited by academics the world over.\n\nMetronomy Forever is a record that exudes a green tranquillity. Mount was concerned that the relative happiness of his existence might stifle his creativity, having no great tragedy to draw from, but discovered the opposite was true.\n\n\u201cTo be jealous of having that stuff going on is a bit dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cI look at successful musicians who, as they get older, struggle to remain relevant. I\u2019m at this point where I feel like, my attitude towards what I do is healthy. With this record I wanted to make a very pure expression of what I\u2019m about right now, and I think for me that makes for better music.\u201d\n\nAnd while the music itself promotes a sense of calm joy, it\u2019s in the lyrics that we remember that even idyllic circumstances require their own maintenance, an oiling of the cogs to keep them crunching along. Mount reminds us of this on Lately, desperately singing \u201cThat is love and it's hard to do, it's a job for two. What do I do if I don't get nothing from you?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the physical space and distance from stress and life on the Rue De Dogshit in the French capital that has had its effect on the creative process. \u202fMount spent much of the last four years working with Robyn on her acclaimed and deeply personal record Honey. 48 months of vicarious agony was exhausting, but ultimately extremely fulfilling.\n\n\u201cIn the space of time since the last Metronomy record I\u2019ve had a very large part in writing an album based on a traumatic experience for her. I knew the whole experience was going to be this massive cathartic thing. When it got to the point of finishing, I remember telling her how good it was and how people are really going to respond to it in the way you want them to. Working with someone and being able to tell someone that is quite an enjoyable thing, being able to know that everything\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a nice feeling to have.\u201d\n\nThose glimmers of emotional, intense, carnal mania seem to have rubbed off on Mount in their own way, too. On Sex Emoji, the subconscious throbbing purple of the erotic digitised aubergine comes to life, a refrain of \u2018love, honey, sex, money\u2019 sang in a coital squeal.\n\nSalted Caramel Ice Cream brings this to the fore too, but more in the vein of Lipps Inc\u2019s Funkytown, and evokes the sapid pleasure and delights of love, but also the panics and anxieties (\u2018Oh god, she\u2019s coming, don\u2019t look up\u2019).\n\nBut when the shagging is over you\u2019re left only with the despair of your sweaty reflection. The moments of pain and sadness on Metronomy Forever are just as real, but also surmountable, much like most of the torture of existence ultimately is. It\u2019s the scope of experience of someone who has decided that agony, while perhaps a good palette from which to scrape your paints, is just not really that much fun. We\u2019re here for a good time, not a long time, and, as Homer Simpson once said, \u201cYou could wake up dead tomorrow.\u201d Get on your hands and knees, plunge your fingers in the soil and scream thanks at the moon for making the waves crash warm foam at the feet of our children.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": [-122.23, 37.732], "Artist": "Tom Lumley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8448224.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.23, 37.732], "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tom Lumley is a Indie singer/songwriter originally from Cambridgeshire.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career.
