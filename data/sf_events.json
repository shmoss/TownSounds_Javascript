Affectionately known as the \u201cIron Man of the Mask,\u201d Franc held the title of \u201cThe World\u2019s Longest-Running Phantom\u201d for more than a decade after bringing over five million theatre-goers to their feet in a 6-1/2-year run.\n\nBut that distinction only scratches the surface of an illustrious career spanning decades, including his portrayal of the opera-singing Anthony Corleone, son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton\u2019s characters in the seven-time Academy Award-nominated film Godfather III. Franc also sang the Academy Award-winning theme song \"Speak Softly Love\" for both the film and Original Motion Picture soundtrack, garnering over one million hits on YouTube. Paramount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search for the young Corleone, auditioning more than 2,000 artists over a one-year period before casting Franc in the role. He is the first and only person ever to sing Carmine Coppola\u2019s haunting Godfather theme in the film trilogy.\n\nFranc\u2019s performance of the song so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to study at Pavarotti\u2019s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously studied at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of \u201cTony\u201d in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow\u2019s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical.\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s BROADWAY: Songs from the Great White Way, and Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, along with tributes to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, including NBC\u2019s \u201cBrian Boitano\u2019s Skating Spectacular\u201d and \u201cThe 2005 Tribute to Music on Ice\u201d with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc\u2019s performance of \u201cMusic of the Night,\u201d as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening\u2019s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nIn May 2018, Franc was honored to receive a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival. He has released three successful solo CDs, one of which has the unique distinction as the soundtrack for Barry Manilow\u2019s daily workout. In addition to his one-man shows, Franc is also currently touring the world with The Four Phantoms In Concert.", "otherInfo": "On February 3, Franc D\u2019Ambrosio will be honored at a special knighting ceremony hosted by Lorenzo Ortona, Consul General of Italy, at the Italian Consulate in San Francisco, where he will be officially designated as Il Cavaliere dell\u2019Ordine della Stella della Solidarieta\u2019 Italiana (The Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity).

Affectionately known as the \u201cIron Man of the Mask,\u201d Franc held the title of \u201cThe World\u2019s Longest-Running Phantom\u201d for more than a decade after bringing over five million theatre-goers to their feet in a 6-1/2-year run.\n\nBut that distinction only scratches the surface of an illustrious career spanning decades, including his portrayal of the opera-singing Anthony Corleone, son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton\u2019s characters in the seven-time Academy Award-nominated film Godfather III. Franc also sang the Academy Award-winning theme song \"Speak Softly Love\" for both the film and Original Motion Picture soundtrack, garnering over one million hits on YouTube. Paramount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search for the young Corleone, auditioning more than 2,000 artists over a one-year period before casting Franc in the role. He is the first and only person ever to sing Carmine Coppola\u2019s haunting Godfather theme in the film trilogy.\n\nFranc\u2019s performance of the song so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to study at Pavarotti\u2019s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously studied at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of \u201cTony\u201d in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow\u2019s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical.\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s BROADWAY: Songs from the Great White Way, and Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, along with tributes to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, including NBC\u2019s \u201cBrian Boitano\u2019s Skating Spectacular\u201d and \u201cThe 2005 Tribute to Music on Ice\u201d with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc\u2019s performance of \u201cMusic of the Night,\u201d as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening\u2019s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nIn May 2018, Franc was honored to receive a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival.

Fang guitarist Tom Flynn and bass player Brian Beattie, his former bandmate from the bands \"Tapeworm\" and \"Safety Patrol\", put out \"Yukon Fang\" as a duo and thus Fang was born. The original version of Fang toured the country once, only to break up shortly thereafter with Beattie moving on to Texas where he later formed the band Glass Eye. In the early fall of 1981 Flynn began playing with drummer Chris Ritter. They soon added bass player Chris Wilson and began playing shows in the SF Bay area as a three piece, with Flynn on vocals.While this was happening, Sam McBride, the band's soon-to-be vocalist, was singing with future Fang drummer Greg Langston in the band \"Shut up\". In early 1982 Ritter was replaced with drummer Joel Fox, and at Fox's audition he brought along his friend McBride, who volunteered to be the band's singer. The lineup thus solidified as McBride (vocals), Chris Wilson (bass), Tom Flynn (guitar), and Joel Fox (drums). Together they contributed the song \"Fun with Acid\" on the Not so Quiet on the Western Front compilation LP. Shortly thereafter, guitarist Tom Flynn created \"Boner Records\" and released their debut LP and EP Landshark and Where the Wild Things Are. Tim Stiletto drummed on the latter. These two releases are now considered classic East Bay punk.\n\nIn January 1986, the \"Spun Helga\" LP was recorded in West Germany with McBride singing vocals, and two Germans named Joe (Guitar) and Ollie (Drums) playing instruments. We Bite Records in Germany released the LP, but in the U.S. it was handled by National Trust Records. Fang next released was 1987's \"A Mi Ga Sfafas?\" (The title literally means \"Give Me Head?\"). The lineup during this era was McBride, Bill Collins (guitar), Joe Miller (bass), and Steve Chinn (drums). Drummer Mike Branum replaced Chinn and Fang recorded the album \"Pissed-Off Buddah\", which remained unreleased until 2008, when it was released with Fang's other albums \"Spun Helga\" and \"A Mi Ga Sfafas?\"\n\nAfter a long break, Fang regrouped in 1996 and put out the \"Electric Chair\" single on Man's Ruin Records. The lineup at this time included Sam McBride (vocals), Greg Langston (Drums), Bill Burnett (Guitar) and Josh Levine (Bass). This incarnation of the Band recorded the \"American Nightmare\" LP on Wingnut Records.\n\nIn 1989, Boner Records released Fang's first compilation album, Landshark/Where the Wild Thing Are. The album included Fang's debut album and debut EP.\n\nIn 1999, Jim Martin (from Faith No More) joined on guitar, and recorded four songs for the Hello Records CD Fish and Vegetables, which was released as a split LP by fellow punk rock groups Dr. Know, and Hellions In May 2000, Sammytown and Jim Martin, along with Casey Orr (Gwar, Rigor Mortis) on bass, and Dallas drummer Clint Phillips did two shows in Texas. One at Trees in Dallas, and a sold out show at Emo's in Austin.\n\nBy 2001, the band was composed of Sammytown, Brian Schopflin (bass), Jonny Manak (guitar), Alby Wasted (guitar),and Ike Eichensehr (drums). Sammytown, Brian, Jonny, Alby and Ike also started The Resistoleros, a Oakland-based rock 'n' roll band. Steel Cage Records released the Resistoleros CD Rock 'N Roll Napalm in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, the Live Cheap\" CD' came out on Malt Soda Recordings featuring Sammytown (vocals), Brian Schopflin (bass), Ike Eichensehr (drums), Alby Wasted (guitar) and Jimmy Crucifix (guitarist for 1980s hardcore band Crucifix and hard rock band Proudflesh) also on guitar. This is the only Fang recording with two guitarists.\n\nIn 2004, the band toured the United States. Sammytown, Jimmy Crucifix (guitar), Brian Schopflin (bass)/Bubba Dennis (bass) and Ike Eichensehr (drums) toured as Fang in the Spring of 2004 and as the Resistoleros and Fang in November 2004 with Sam, Jimmy, Brian, Ike and Greg Elliott (rhythm guitar).\n\nIn January 2005, Sammy, Jimmy, Brian and Ike recorded a cover of Agression's (1980s hardcore\u2013Narcore band) song \"Salty Leather\" for a tribute to Agression members Mark Hickey and Henry Knowles, who had died. Dave Haro and JellyRoll came up with the idea for the tribute. The CD, Taking Out A Little Agression, was released on Dr. Strange Records in 2007 and featured bands including JFA, McRad, DI, Ill Repute, Dr. Know, Verbal Abuse, MDC, Oppressed Logic, Shattered Faith and Dave Haro\u2013JellyRoll's band KatKiller.\n\nFrom 2005\u20132008, Fang performed with the steady line-up of Sammytown, Jimmy Crucifix, Brian Schopflin, and Greg Langsten (returning to the drums). As of writing (July, 2012) the line-up consists of Sammytown (Vocals), Jamey Dangerous (Drums), Brian Schopflin (Bass), J-Stain Werthless (Lead Guitar), Mat ('The Kid') McCoy (Guitar). Original member Tom Flynn has re-emerged and played live with the band on at least one occasion in 2012. He also contributed to the latest Fang album, 'Here Come the Cops\".\n\nIn 2011, Malt Soda released the CD \"Pissed Off Buddha\", comprising three Fang albums - \"Spun Helga\", \"A Mi Ga Sfafas?\", and \"Pissed Off Buddha\" - the latter being a previously unreleased album recorded in 1988, in a double disc package that included a live DVD of the band.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "The Marcus King Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9402588.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Tue Feb 4 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-04", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Soul music from the South", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Filmore", "moreBioInfo": "Songwriter.

Five original melodic hard rock songs that highlight his raw, honest lyrics and peel back the curtain of the heart and mind of Odetto. Curses and Revelations features many standout guitar moments that are so passionate and soulful that it\u2019s as if we are witness to a musical truth serum.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "597 E El Camino Real, Sunnyvale, CA 94087", "Artist": "The Anachronistics", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9577226.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.02544, 37.36218], "Date": "Wed Feb 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-05", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "AC Hotel by Marriott Sunnyvale Cupertino", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1511 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117-2912", "Artist": "The High Water Line", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8826196.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.44759, 37.76983], "Date": "Wed Feb 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-05", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Acoustic, Alternative Folk, Americana", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Club Deluxe", "moreBioInfo": "The High Water Line is a 5 piece group of Bay Area musicians who blend their diverse musical tastes and experiences to create a modern bluegrass sound all their own.\n\nWe can be found playing around the Bay Area a few times a month, and the members of HWL have performed all over the world, from New York to Shanghai and even in our own backyard at the CBA\u2019s Father\u2019s Day Festival.\n\nWhile all the members of HWL come from outside CA, we call it home now and feel lucky that the amazing bluegrass community here has allowed us to come together and share our musical passions.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "Edward Simon - Piano\nHrabba Atladottir - Violin\nEric Gaenslen - Cello\n\nThe master of Argentinian tango\u2019s homage to the changing seasons in his home country provides a new twist on Vivaldi\u2019s famous work.

DownBeat has called him \u201cone of the strongest pianists of his generation, with intuitive empathy and drum-like ingenuity,\u201d while Jazz Journal International has singled out \u201chis deep emotional statements\u201d as a composer and improviser. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area as a member of the all-star SFJAZZ Collective, he has been a Guggenheim Fellow along with being awarded multiple composition grants as part of the Chamber Music America\u2019s New Jazz Works initiative. Simon, a Yamaha artist, has recorded 15 albums as a leader or co-leader. His latest is Sorrows and Triumphs, released via Sunnyside Records in April 2018; the album was declared \u201cunmissable\u201d in Nate Chinen\u2019s Take Five column on WBGO.org, and the pianist was featured in an extensive DownBeat interview upon the disc\u2019s release. This follows Simon\u2019s 2016 album Latin American Songbook, which won him an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Jazz Album; a four-and-a-half-star DownBeat review also praised his fresh vision of classic Latin American songs as \u201cgrand and sophisticated.\u201d\n\nAnother key release for Simon was his 2014 Sunnyside album Venezuelan Suite, which saw the pianist blend the tuneful, buoyant sounds of his native country with the harmonically sophisticated, forward-looking manner of jazz. All About Jazz marveled: \u201cVenezuelan Suite\u2026 is the perfect confluence of Venezuelan ideals, jazz language and chamber-esque sophistication. In short, it\u2019s a masterpiece.\u201d One of Simon\u2019s most recent collaborative projects is the trio Steel House, with the pianist joined by bassist Scott Colley and drummer Brian Blade for a group that blends acoustic jazz improvisation with electronic-tinged atmospherics for an inviting, song-oriented sound.

His sound offers the complete package\u2014unforgettable melodies, emotionally charged storytelling, and top-notch guitar chops\u2014all gloriously displayed on Yates\u2019 new album, Huntsville. Produced by Jim Bryson (Weakerthans, Kathleen Edwards, Oh Susanna), Yates\u2019 second full-length effort is a major stylistic step forward, with its 11 tracks capturing his artistic evolution amid extensive touring over the past three years. Along with handling production duties, Bryson\u2019s abilities as a multi-instrumentalist were fully deployed during sessions at North of Princess Studio in Kingston, Ontario, leading a band that included Brian Dunne on guitars/vocals, James Preston on bass, Marshall Bureau on drums, and guest vocalist Amanda Rheaume. For Yates, the stars were aligned throughout the creation of Huntsville, beginning with a balanced mix of road-tested and brand new material amassed before hitting the studio. Yates\u2019 only pre-conceived notion for the album was to move forward from his last album and let Bryson put his years of experience to work. \u201cAfter playing some of these songs live, you start getting attached to how you think they should sound,\u201d Yates explains. \u201cI originally had in mind that this would be mostly a solo acoustic record, but I told myself going into the studio not to be too precious about my own ideas. The best part was, with that in mind, I was able to let go of some of that control and told Jim to run with it. He\u2019d say, \u2018Let\u2019s try things my way and if you don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll press the mute button.\u2019 But I loved all of his ideas, and that\u2019s when I understood what a great collaboration it would be.\u201d \u201cKeep Your Head Down,\u201d with its subtle, driving groove, opens the album like a train pulling out at dawn, with vast, open vistas lying ahead. Those come into focus on other key tracks such as \u201cOnce More To The Lake,\u201d \u201cRoll Me On Home\u201d and \u201cThe Best Part Of Leaving.\u201d Yet, everywhere on the album, echoes of the Canadian songwriting tradition, from Gordon Lightfoot to Bruce Cockburn to Ron Sexsmith, are apparent, proving that with Huntsville, Ken Yates is ready to join that exalted company. Choosing to name Huntsville after a song he\u2019d written about a small northern Ontario town is a further indication of Yates\u2019 musical vision. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that I love,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the songs were inspired by what you could say was a northern Ontario landscape, but that song in particular is about leaving everything behind, traveling up north and staying there. After I wrote the line, \u2018If them mornings don\u2019t shine how you like, find a night to dream into,\u2019 I felt like it represented the whole album in way, which is why I decided to make it the title track.\u201d A native of London, Ontario (a few hours\u2019 drive south of Huntsville), Yates studied at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston. His first release, The Backseat EP, came out in 2011, whereupon he got a chance to showcase for fellow Berklee alum John Mayer, who responded with a lengthy blog post that read in part, \u201cKen Yates wrote a song called \u2018I Don\u2019t Wanna Fall In Love.\u2019 This song moved me when I first heard it, and it still does today.\u201d That track became one of the standouts on Yates\u2019 2013 full-length debut, twenty-three, made after a year of pounding the pavement in New York City. It also became his introduction to the life of a touring musician, and his diligence in that area soon built a devoted group of admirers, one town at a time. \u201cAt this point, touring still feels fresh to me, and at least half the songs on Huntsville came out of experiences I\u2019d had on the road,\u201d Yates says. \u201cGoing back to some of these places kind of feels like visiting old friends now. I\u2019m still mainly playing solo, but making this record has really motivated me to start playing more\u2014and hopefully bigger\u2014shows with a band.\u201d Ken Yates is a rare example of someone who, from the beginning, had clear intentions when he embraced the troubadour life, and the combined drive and talent to make it a reality. With Huntsville, he has now closed the chapter on those early days, and is ready to open a new and exciting one, without any limits holding back his artistic ambition.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60.

He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act.

I'd call it 'future pop,'\" says Blake. \"Across the album, I juxtapose so many different kinds of music. It's very anthemic, and there's an epic feel. The album metaphor has to do with finding our colors, as we are all chameleons. I'm standing out on the cover because I've found mine. I will always continue to stretch the boundaries of the human voice and create the music that colors my life.\"\n\n\n\nUsing Blake's own painstakingly handcrafted library of sampled mouth sounds (\"beatboxing, sound effects, vocal scratching, the works\") as its foundation, Portrait of a Chameleon runs the gamut from the reggae-tinged Nick Hexum co-write \"She Gives Me Her Love\" to the horn-laden funky-freshness of \"Disco in Space,\" from the sexy slow-jam \"Lost in Heaven\" to the poignant life-on-the-fringe cautionary tale \"Not Today,\" the latter inspired by Blake's mother, whom he considers his main inspiration. The album also features the hard-hitting, bass-in-your-face \"Your Touch,\" the soundtrack to 2013's Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 campaign \u2014 which starred Blake, played on more than 19,000 theater screens across the U.S., received more than 1.2 billion impressions, and has already sold 130,000 copies worldwide.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the centerpiece of Portrait is the '80s-tastic pop epic \"Retro Romance.\" A sonic sequel of sorts to \"Heartbreak on Vinyl,\" the frothy, feelgood ode to a Jordache-clad dreamgirl with \"Suzanne Somers thighs\" sounds like a final-love-scene song on a John Hughes soundtrack \u2014 meaning, of course, that it sounds totally awesome. \"Duran Duran, the Cure, Depeche Mode, Prince, and Michael Jackson were always playing when I was growing up, on CD or on vinyl,\" Blake says fondly of his proud '80s influences.\n\n\n\nHowever, Portrait of a Chameleon \u2014 out on Blake's on Audio Day Dream Records and distributed through InGrooves \u2014 still has a hypermodern feel, and Blake is looking ahead, hoping that his \"future pop\" will connect with fans of all ages. \"So here we go/A chance to start again/The melody is calling me/There's no time to pretend,\" he boldly declares in the album's opening track.\n\n\n\n\"I never wanted to stick to one style or stay in one place,\" Blake stresses. \"And I haven't been more proud of anything in my life than this album.\"\n\n\n\n\"Blake Lewis is such an amazing talent, and Portrait of a Chameleon really delivers on showcasing all his skill and artistry.\" \u2014 Ken Jordan, The Crystal Method\n\n\n\n\"Blake is a super-soulful and creative dude.

Then the guitar comes out and kicks the show into an even higher gear with songs about the bright future (and dark past) of babies and what he would do if he woke up one morning as an actual woman.\n\n\n\nOn stage, Phil\u2019s playful humor and likeable, endearing manner allow him to shake things up without antagonizing the audience.

Greene is also a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh\u2019s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\n\n\nMusical passion and creative integrity have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. Growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar during his childhood. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\n\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Jackie relocated to Sacramento, where he quickly became a local favorite. His popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\n\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. After a five year recording hiatus to focus on touring with Phil Lesh, the Black Crowes, Trigger Hippy, and WRG, Greene\u2019s latest album, Back to Birth, will be released in August 2015.\n\n\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"", "otherInfo": "Doors: 7:30pm / Show: 8:30 pm."}, {"Address": "757 Bridgeway, Sausalito, CA 94965", "Artist": "Kate Gaffney", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8682343.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.480292, 37.856604], "Date": "Wed Feb 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-05", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Groove, Roots, Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "No Name Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-songwriter Kate Gaffney honed her skills in her native Philadelphia, jumped from coast to coast, and laid musical roots in Northern California.\n\nThe exploration of coastal living, in all of its glory, splendor, isolation, and mystery, has inspired Kate to make a new concept album - coming soon!", "otherInfo": "Kate Gaffney & Friends\nat No Name Bar\n\nPost-Super Bowl Fun!\n\nWednesday, Feb 5\n8:30-11:30\n\nNo Cover, Tips Welcome\n\n21+"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Isabella Rossellini", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9830326.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Wed Feb 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-05", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Link Link Circus by Isabella Rossellini at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "2344 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Pussy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/147991.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.434294, 37.763629], "Date": "Wed Feb 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-05", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Beaux", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Pussy Party\" w/ Sasha, Ms. Jackson, and guests"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Traps", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8462339.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Wed Feb 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-05", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Electronic Rock, Art Rock, Synth Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "TRAPS is a self produced indie electronic band formed in Seattle, WA in 2016.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE.

It\u2019s also the most catchy and hooky goth \u2019n\u2019 roll you have ever heard \u2013 no wonder since the album\u2019s made under the supervision of the Swedish pop orientated production team called On The Verge. The team of Pat Phoenix and Joakim \u00d6vrenius has been co-writing with THE 69 EYES before; songs like \u201cNever Say Die\u201d and \u201cPerfect Skin\u201d have been written with them, but it was until now that the Helsinki Vampires felt it was the right time to move their coffins to Stockholm and record the entire album there. \u201cThis is our \u201cMade in Sweden\u201d album. We\u2019ve considered Stockholm as one of our home towns really for a long, so it was about the time! It was also the time to bring back the more melodic side of ours, so with On The Verge guys that was perfect too. Lyric wise I thought to get also more personal since I had the chance to exploit my classic \u201cMy Babe Left Me\u201d situation, so that\u2019s where the real melancholy comes from this time,\u201d says the singer, Jyrki69. The 10th 69 EYES album was recorded in Stockholm and Helsinki during the spring of 2012. It was produced by Swedish team On The Verge and mixed by Stefan Boman (KENT, THE HELLACOPTERS, BACKYARD BABIES). It takes THE 69 EYES\u2019 goth \u2019n\u2019 roll sound back to their highlights decade ago of their albums like \u201cBlessed Be\u201d and \u201cParis Kills\u201d, yet rising the singer Jyrki\u2019s voice as the main statement of the record.

He is equally at home playing with jazz veteran Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish sean-n\u00f3s singer Roisin El Safty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata.

This kaleidoscopic vocabulary - always in flux - provides the grist to Turrisi\u2019s improvisational mill and the rough material from which he crafts his uniquely original, haunting music.\nHis ability to rework ancient melodies and rhythms through a contemporary jazz prism marks him out as one of the most striking voices to have emerged on the European jazz scene in the past decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1928 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612-2202", "Artist": "Scott Amendola", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7596193.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.80952], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "Genres: Free Jazz, Jazz", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Uptown", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Amendola:\nDrummer/Composer/Bandleader/Educator\n\u201cAmendola\u2019s music is consistently engaging, both emotionally and intellectually, the product of a fertile and inventive musical imagination.\u201d Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cIf Scott Amendola didn't exist, the San Francisco music scene would have to invent him.\u201d Derk Richardson, San Francisco Bay Guardian\n\n\u201cAmendola has complete mastery of every piece of his drumset and the ability to create a plethora of sounds using sticks, brushes, mallets, and even his hands.\u201dSteven Raphael, Modern Drummer\n\n\u201c...drummer/signal-treater Scott Amendola is both a tyrant of heavy rhythm and an electric-haired antenna for outworldly messages (not a standard combination).\u201d Greg Burk, LA Weekly\n\nFor Scott Amendola, the drum kit isn\u2019t so much an instrument as a musical portal. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings.

At 21, Ian started playing professionally in San Jose, California sitting in with The Illiance at 55 South's jam sesh.

The album\u2019s uplifting lead single \u201cRevival\u201d is also available today to stream or download.\n\nWe'd tell you Gregory Porter is back, but you probably already knew. You probably felt the earth rumbling, announcing the man's bone-deep baritone, or you felt the air change as the warmth of his sound filled the atmosphere like a hug from above. That's because All Rise, his sixth studio album, marks a return to Porter's beloved original songwriting \u2014 heart-on-sleeve lyrics imbued with everyday philosophy and real-life detail, set to a stirring mix of jazz, soul, blues, and gospel. Produced by Troy Miller (Laura Mvula, Jamie Cullum, Emili Sand\u00e9), the set also represents the evolution of Porter's art to something even more emphatic, emotive, intimate, and universal too.\n\nAs Porter worked out this album's direction, he looked inward, upward, and around him, and arrived at a raison d'\u00eatre found in the title, ALL RISE. \u201cWe hear that phrase when presidents or judges come into the room,\u201d says Porter, \u201cbut I'm thinking all of us rise \u2014 not just one person being exalted. We are all exalted and lifted up by love. This is my political thought and my real truth. It comes from my personality, my mother's personality, the personality of the blues, and of black people. It's this idea of making do with the scraps, of resurrection and ascension, and of whatever the current situation is, it can get better through love.\u201d\n\nThough Porter had an acclaimed role in the original 1999 Broadway cast of It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues \u2014 and staged his own Nat King Cole & Me musical in 2004 \u2014 it was inevitable that he'd became known for his songs. That was made abundantly clear when both of Porter's indie albums \u2014 2010's Water and 2012's Be Good \u2014 received Grammy nominations, paving the way for his world-beating 2013 Blue Note debut, Liquid Spirit, which won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album. He hasn't let down his legion of fans since, whether collaborating with Disclosure on \"Holding On,\" scoring another Grammy for Take Me to the Alley (2016), or telling his life story through Cole's songbook. Like others, Porter is still surprised by his runaway success, but he has a theory: \"I was soothed by my voice as a child and I think that's the same thing others get from it. I'm trying to heal myself with these songs.\"\n\nAnd that's the thing about love that All Rise keeps circling. Even when it's painful, confusing, out of reach, or under attack, love is ultimately curative. Once again, Porter cuts through the noise of genres and the mess of life to reach us all where we live: the heart.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Lucky Chops", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8999677.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "Genres: Happy Horns", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "Follow us on Twitter:\n@theluckychops\n\nFollow us on Instagram:\n@theluckychops\n\nAdd us on Snapchat:\n@theluckychops", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Wynonna", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8235567.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Americana", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "\"Wynonna & The Big Noise\" on tour now!", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Thursday January 23"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Wayne Krantz", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9923875.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "Genres: Multi, Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Born.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 7:30 PM SHOW: 8 PM\nPremier Seating + Meet and Greet available"}, {"Address": "2181 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "B Wiley", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9290968.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267491, 37.869841], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, hip hop, funk, psychedelic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Jupiter", "moreBioInfo": "B Wiley is Ben Wiley, a producer and musician whose mission is to bridge the gaps between many styles of music.

The Los Angeles-based trio made their bones as purveyors of post-millennial punk, but with their third full-length release \u2013 and Harvest Records debut \u2013 BADILLAC, they pay their debt to the supersonic 90s rock that first inspired them. The band has not sacrificed a spurt of precious energy, instead integrating nuance and dynamic momentum to songs like \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and the undeniably badass title track. The volcanic riffs and massive melodies are matched by an equally provocative lyrical stance, with songs like \u201cSick Shit\u201d and the album-closing \u201cWhere The Night Ends\u201d casting an acerbic eye over the wreckage of the party they helped start \u2013 it\u2019s 3am and the drunken fun has given way to sexual panic, anxiety and self-doubt. Slightly stoned but by no means slack, BADILLAC reveals together PANGEA to be both confident and surprisingly committed, their audacious ambition already impossible to contain.\n\n\u201cIt might be confusing for people, assuming we\u2019re like this garage punk band and then hearing this record,\u201d says singer/songwriter/guitarist William Keegan. \u201cBut we really don\u2019t want to get trapped at all.\u201d\n\nKeegan first started writing and recording in his Santa Clarita bedroom, his teenage tapes eventually coming to full flower with the aid of bassist Danny Bengston and drummer Erik Jimenez. Known then simply as Pangea, the band played countless beer blasts in and around CalArts, their boozy mayhem and breakneck pop hooks quickly earning them frenzied crowds throughout the Southern California DIY scene and beyond. A string of seven-inches, cassettes, and LPs \u2013 including 2011\u2019s ace second album, LIVING DUMMY, released by Burger Records and The Smell\u2019s Olfactory label \u2013 followed, as did gigs alongside a veritable who\u2019s-who of like-minded rockers, including Ty Segall, Mikal Cronin, Wavves, and The Black Lips (not to mention 2013\u2019s epic \u201cBurgerama Caravan of Stars\u201d US tour).\n\nBADILLAC was recorded with their longtime producer/engineer Andrew Schubert over three intensive sessions at his Tarzana studio, their roster augmented by second guitarist Cory Hanson (of the electronic pop outfit, W-H-I-T-E). While many bands in their position would have simply continued banging out the party punk, together PANGEA decided to throw a curveball at themselves and their fervent fanbase.\n\n\u201cWe wrote like 30 plus songs for this record,\u201d Bengston says, \u201chalf of which have the same punky bubblegum vibe of our last record. Then we had this other batch of songs, a little more melancholy, a little heavier, a little darker. I think in the end we just decided to try to not make the same record twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I write, there are certain songs that I feel fit the band,\u201d Keegan says, \u201cand then there are songs where it doesn\u2019t feel like they fit. At some point, I was like, maybe we should try some of the songs that don\u2019t necessarily fit. Because I realized that they do fit \u2013 they\u2019re just different.\u201d\n\nThough Keegan cites such unexpected heroes as Pete Seeger and 21st Century K Records artists like Little Wings and the Microphones, he fully fesses up to BADILLAC\u2019s most primal inspirations. Indeed, songs like \u201cWhy\u201d and the cello-laced \u201cNo Way Out\u201d fuse classic post punk ambivalence with fist-pumping stadium rock, their neurotic hooks, throat-rending vocals, and fat, distorted riffs hearkening back to the glory days of the alternative nation.\n\n\u201cTo me, the album is so obviously influenced by the shit that I was listening to when I was 16,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cGrowing up in the 90s, all that stuff \u2013 Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Weezer. It wasn\u2019t conscious, the album just sounds like that. It feels like that music is etched in deeper that music I\u2019ve listened to as an adult. For whatever reason, the music you listened to when you\u2019re confused and young gets in deeper than anything you might listen to later.\u201d\n\nBADILLAC also sees together PANGEA stepping away from their association with a much-hyped scene they believe too often revels in its own idiocy, Keegan\u2019s wry lyrics pushing both their music and subject matter towards unsettling themes of impotence, fear, ennui, and detachment.\n\n\u201cWe think less and less about how we fit into this garage punk scene that we never even technically felt a part of,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cWe just kinda get lumped into that. I\u2019m not really stoked on what a lot of those bands are saying, there\u2019s a lot of misogyny and stuff I\u2019m not into.\u201d\n\nLike any angst-ridden tunesmith worth his salt, Keegan also directs his gaze inwards, coming to turns with his own cynical view of relationships on songs like the mordant \u201cOffer,\u201d their cracked melodies and jaundiced skepticism fueled by his recent romantic struggles.\n\n\u201cI went through a really difficult relationship where we were breaking up every three months for four years,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of it, I was just like, \u201cThis is never gonna work.\u2019 It was pretty intense and I think that informs a lot of the songs on the album.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kinda funny,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs soon as we finished this record, we broke up for good.\u201d\n\nBADILLAC will drive together PANGEA through 2014, their imminent plans essentially consisting of touring until they drop. Nevertheless, the band finds themselves in the unprecedented position of having to ponder the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing where the next record is gonna go,\u201d Bengston says, \u201cwe still haven\u2019t put our finger on it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Keegan says, \u201cbecause we never had to have those formal discussions, like, \u2018What should the next record sound like?\u2019 It\u2019s always been pretty natural. Hopefully that\u2019s what\u2019ll end up happening again.\u201d\nNovember 2013", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30 // Show 8 // ALL SALES ARE FINAL"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Keith Carlock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7829692.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Jazz, Rock, Jazz Fusion", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Keith Carlock is a professional drummer currently residing in New York City, NY and Nashville, TN with his wife, singer/songwriter Lynne Timmes-Carlock and their two daughters, Zia and Ayla.

Fraser, acclaimed by the San Francisco Examiner as \u201cthe Michael Jordan of Scottish fiddling,\u201d has a concert and recording career spanning over 40 years, with a long list of awards, accolades, television credits, and feature performances on top movie soundtracks (Last of the Mohicans,Titanic, Stone of Destiny). Fraser has been sponsored by the British Council to represent Scotland\u2019s music internationally, and received the Scottish Heritage Center Service Award for outstanding contributions to Scottish culture and traditions. The 31-year-old Haas, a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music, wasn\u2019t even born when Alasdair was winning national fiddle competitions on the other side of the Atlantic. But this seemingly unlikely pairing is the fulfillment of a long-standing musical dream for Fraser, whose cutting-edge musical explorations took him full circle to find a cellist who could help him return the cello to its historical role at the rhythmic heart of Scottish dance music. Natalie Haas was just 11 when she first attended Fraser\u2019s Valley of the Moon Scottish Fiddling School in California. She responded to Fraser\u2019s challenge to find and release the cello\u2019s rhythmic soul, and four years later, when Natalie was just 15, Fraser and Haas played their first gig together. Now regularly touring with Fraser and creating a buzz at festivals and in concert halls throughout Europe and North America, Natalie is in the vanguard of young cellists who are re-defining the role of the cello in traditional music. \u201cCellists are coming out of the woodwork to study with Natalie, to learn how she creates a groove and a whole powerful rhythm section,\u201d says Fraser. \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to hear the cello unleashed from its orchestral shackles!\u201d The Duo has just released fourth recording \"ABUNDANCE\" and along with 2010's \"Highlander's Farewell\" , 2007's \"In the Moment\" and the award winning \"Fire & Grace\" \u2014 all on Fraser\u2019s own Culburnie Records label \u2014 they are providing a great deal of inspiration to other players. The CDs display the duo\u2019s dazzling teamwork, driving, dancing rhythms, and their shared passion for improvising on the melody and the groove of Scottish tunes. \u201cHaas is the percussive power to Fraser's fiddle fireworks, providing syncopated, bowed underpinnings to his melodies and solos,\u201d writes Kira Schlechter of The Patriot News. The duo has performs frequently in Europe, and throughout the US and Canada. They have been featured on NPR\u2019s Performance Today, the Thistle & Shamrock, and Mountain Stage, and represented Scotland at the Smithsonian Museum\u2019s Folklife Festival.

Greene is also a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh\u2019s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\n\n\nMusical passion and creative integrity have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. Growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar during his childhood. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\n\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Jackie relocated to Sacramento, where he quickly became a local favorite. His popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\n\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. After a five year recording hiatus to focus on touring with Phil Lesh, the Black Crowes, Trigger Hippy, and WRG, Greene\u2019s latest album, Back to Birth, will be released in August 2015.\n\n\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Juicy", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433406, 37.764392], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, Funk, R&b/soul, Soul", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Lookout", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Juicy\" at Lookout: The elevated location, long windows, and outdoor balcony give this Castro bar its name, where queers nosh on pizza and dance to DJed music while keeping an eye open for people to meet."}, {"Address": "2369 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "PICANTE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.434352, 37.762839], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Picante\" w/ DJ Marco & guest DJs"}, {"Address": "522 2nd St, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Rachel Lark", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7617721.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.277791, 37.797058], "Date": "Thu Feb 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-06", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Singer, Songwriter, Political, Alternative, Experimental Pop Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakland Metro Operahouse", "moreBioInfo": "Rachel Lark is a San Francisco based singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist.

This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint. She continues to tour and record as well as remaining a strong presence in her community, working with local youth as a vocal coach and mentor. She encourages them to follow their dreams to sing freely and wholeheartedly. -Written by Elle K. Productions 9x award-winning R&B/Soul music artist.

Available via streaming, CD and \"Beer\" colored vinyl on November 22, 2019 @ https://acetate.com\n\n\n\"High Water\"\n\nEleven songs \u2014 raucous, blues-based, uncompromising \u2014 mark a triumphant return for \"Hollywood\" rockers JUNKYARD on their first official album in 26 years via Acetate Records.\n\nWhile odds and sods have been released over the decades, \"High Water\" is a firm statement of the band's 2017, and onward, intent. As singer and founding member David Roach explains, in recent years, JUNKYARD had a blast playing \"reunion\" shows, which quickly turned into mini-tours through Spain and packed gigs across America. New songs began percolating, and JUNKYARD began writing.\n\n\"I had no grand illusions of a magnum opus, or that we'd try and recreate what we were 25 years ago,\" Roach states. \"This album is not a departure; it's a rock 'n' roll record from JUNKYARD with songs about life, love, regret, addiction and memories.\"\n\nJUNKYARD, who hit MTV and radio hard with their self-titled 1989 Geffen Records debut and singles \"Hollywood\" and \"Simple Man\", cement the authenticity their first two records on \"High Water\", such blunt songs as the soul-searching of \"Cut From The Same Cloth\" to \"We Fuck Like We Fight\" (politely abbreviated as \"WFLWF\" for the politically correct) going down as easy as an aged Kentucky bourbon.\n\nThe band members are straight ahead guys, but \"High Water\" has a few shades of meaning. Guitarist Tim Mosher explains: \"It could be interpreted more than one way \u2014 like a 'high water mark' or the old phrase come 'hell or high water,' or with the image of the bottle on our CD cover, the actual 'high water,' aka booze!\" \"High Water\" also boasts writing and lead guitar credits from Brian Baker, a JUNKYARD founding member who played with the band more than 25 years, but now plays his trade full time with BAD RELIGION. On the road, JUNKYARD are joined by Jimmy James (THE HANGMEN), with founding member Pat Muzingo and bassist Todd Muscat, who joined the band in 1991, rounding out the lineup.\n\n\"The JUNKYARD sound is a pretty classic one: big guitars and drums with David spilling his guts on top,\" says Mosher, who produced the album. We wanted 'High Water' to sound loose and live, so as far as production goes we weren't trying to re- invent the wheel, just deliver the songs in the best light we could, then mix in some big riffs and throaty vocals and that's 'YARD.\"\n\nJUNKYARD's classic sound got some help from a fan and friend on \"High Water\": Charlie Starr from the band BLACKBERRY SMOKE wrote the dramatic, forthright statement \"Till the Wheels Fall Off\" specifically for JUNKYARD.\n\nAs for a theme running through \"High Water\", Roach jokes \"we're not that clever,\" but describes the album as \"a rock 'n' roll record with a nod to punk rock and outlaw country rock.\" It's a sound that's both timeless and timely.\nAs always, JUNKYARD steer clear of politics: \"I personally prefer to keep politics out of my rock. I understand it's a great platform, and maybe some feel it's your duty to use it to a purpose, but I just feel our music is just for escape.\"\n\nFor his part, lyricist Roach is unafraid to mine his own missteps in song, as he did in the past with 1989 fan favorite, \"Hands Off\". This go-round, he confesses all via the tune 'Wallet\". \"That song was inspired by a night I spent with a stranger on the eve of a tour,\" says Roach. \"I met her at [Hollywood bar] Boardners and we went to her place. The next day I snuck off like a rat to go home and pack for the tour. After I left, I realized I left my wallet and had to do the walk of shame to retrieve it. Similar incidents have occurred \u2014 before and since to me \u2014 and I'm sure, countless others.\"\nThe band \u2014 and it's legion of longtime fans \u2014 is excited that \"High Water\" brings back JUNKYARD as an ongoing concern. As one of the great guttersnipe L.A. bands of the late '80s \u2014 a storied crew that includes GUNS N' ROSES, LITTLE CAESAR, THE HANGMEN \u2014 JUNKYARD were proud to be part of \"one of the last great rock 'n' roll scenes,\" as they term it.\n\n\"I don't think we dated ourselves too badly in the beginning so a lot of our songs still have some relevance,\" said Roach. \"Also, we were in hibernation a while, we weren't playing while a lot of our contemporaries were. It's not so much longevity as it was people who missed us 20 years ago finally have a chance to see us.\"\n\nMosher, who was a fan of the group before joining JUNKYARD in 2000, sees all angles of the JUNKYARD saga...\n\n\"Although it's been 17 years since I joined, I'm still 'the new guy,' so with 'High', I wanted to give the fans something I would've wanted as a JUNKYARD fan \u2014 a proper third album,\" said Mosher. \"It was important to all of us that the record be a statement of intent that could connect with fans from back in the day as well as hopefully find new ones for whom this might be their first 'YARD record. It's a tall order, but we're up for it.\"\n\nJUNKYARD:\nDavid Roach - Vocals\nTim Mosher - Guitar\nTodd Muscat - Bass\nPatrick Muzingo - Drums\nJimmy James - Guitar\n\nManagement\nStatus Global MGMT\nScotty Ludwick\n(239) 600-0333\nscotty@statusglobalmgmt.com\n\nBooking Agent (USA)\nAtomic Music Group\nTodd \u201cAggie\u201d Gardner\n(512) 653-7282\naggie@atomicmusicgroup.com\n\nBooking Agent (Europe)\nOtis Tours\nDiego\ndiego@otistours.com\n\nPress Contact\nCarol Maivelett\ncarol@statusglobalmgmt.com\n\nRecord label\nAcetate Records\nP.O.

I've done things my whole life that some people would tell me weren't appropriate 'for a girl'.\u201d That narrative that once tore Dirks down is now what empowers her to take charge of her own story, in her own way.\n\nThe Winnipeg-based Dirks is a Juno Award winner with her former group Chic Gamine. While she thrived off of the collaboration, once the band broke up she knew she was ready to go solo. Even though she was terrified to go out on her own, that feeling was a fundamental factor to positively reinforce that the path she was on was the correct one.\n\nAs Begonia, Dirks is bold, brazen with her florid, surprising pop that is tempered with sensitivity and wisdom. Dirks' first solo output with her 2017 debut EP, Lady in Mind, was well-received, being listed on NPR\u2019s 10 Artists You Need To Know in 2017 and \u201cJuniper\u201d reached #1 on the CBC Music Charts in 2017. Noisey wrote that, \u201cBegonia has one of Canada\u2019s most extraordinary voices, and thankfully she uses it to obliterate the misery from this world one live performance at a time.\u201d NPR wrote that Begonia is \u201cthe place where where synth-pop meets old soul and scrappy meets sexy.\"\n\nBegonia\u2019s songwriting style is largely autobiographical. \u201cThere\u2019s always some element of me in these songs whether I like it or not,\u201d she says bluntly. She gets to the heart of her subject matter, whether it\u2019s learning to come into her own or confronting and processing a brutal heartbreak. Dirks\u2019 intimate lyrics and audacious pop style sound allows for her audience to relate to the messiness of life with an honesty that is refreshing.\n\nWith Begonia\u2019s debut full length album entitled 'Fear' expected next year, Dirks\u2019 leans hard into a sense of arrival. Dirks wrote and co-produced the record with a familiar team: Matt Schellenberg and Matt Petters of Royal Canoe, along with Marcus Paquin, who has previously worked with The National, Stars, Arcade Fire, Local Natives, to name a few.\n\nBegonia forms a special kind of musical translucence. A transparency of learning to unlearn some of the parts Dirks didn\u2019t care to have, the ones she wanted to hold onto and nourish, and how that relationship can inform her music. On her latest single \u201cThe Light,\u201d Dirks sings over soulful swells, her vocals curving around the notes of the song and making them explode as she bluntly tells us \u201chang up the phone and scream your name/ again, again/but I like the pain.\u201d Who among us hasn\u2019t wanted to rage and yell and yet curl into and find comfort in the things that brought us pain? Begonia explores the nuances of such heartfelt emotional experiences.\n\nLooking back doesn\u2019t often mean regret or remorse; mourning the version of you that\u2019s no longer there. It may mean paying tribute to the mistakes, failures, and triumphs. Begonia is a celebration for the arrival of the person Dirks has become both personally and professionally; showing that some things can\u2019t be contained, no matter how much, and that fundamentally they shouldn\u2019t be either.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "998 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Glen Phillips", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7662145.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421431, 37.75704], "Date": "Fri Feb 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-07", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, American Pop, Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Amado's", "moreBioInfo": "Glen Phillips has always been a courageous and inviting songwriter. During his years as lead singer of Toad the Wet Sprocket, the band\u2019s elegant folk/pop sound and his honest, introspective lyrics helped them forge a close bond with their fans. Since starting his solo career, Phillips has pared his music down to its emotional core, concentrating on the simple truths of love and relationships, with a profound spiritual understanding.\nSwallowed by the New takes on life\u2019s difficult transitions and delivers some of the Phillips' most vulnerable songs. \u201cI made this album during the dissolution of a 23 year marriage, Phillips says. \u201cA major chapter of my life was coming to a close, and I discovered early on that I had to work hard to get through the transition with compassion and clarity. These songs were a big part of that process.\u201d\n\nThe album was recorded in May of 2015 with producer/bass player Paul Bryan (Aimee Mann, Lucinda Williams), Jay Bellerose (drums), Chris Bruce (guitar), Jebin Bruni (keys) and Ruby Amanfu (vocals). The sparse arrangements are centered on Phillips\u2019 vocals and acoustic guitar.\n\nShimmering electric guitar accents drift through a curtain of sighing strings on Go, a ballad that bids a poignant farewell to a lover at the end of a relationship.\n\n\u201cAnd though I want you close / This light can only glow / To\nwarn you far away from shore / Saying I love you, now go,\u201d\nLeaving Oldtown has the feel of a classic pop ballad, with a string section and piano supporting a poignant vocal, as Phillips describes a man, \u201chollow as a sparrow bone,\u201d packing up his belongings as winter approaches.\n\nThe Easy Ones focuses on the importance of staying present when it\u2019s not easy or simple, but necessary. Joined in harmony with his 13-year daughter, Phillips says: \u201cYou can\u2019t just love the easy ones / You\u2019ve got to let them in / When you\u2019d rather just run.\u201d\n\nAmnesty is a gentle rocker, with twang-heavy guitars, a funky back beat and elegant string accents, it chronicles a\nlong journey of searching for understanding and safe harbor.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to catch some kind of spark / In every face I see / And offer amnesty.\u201d\n\nHeld Up suggests a gospel tune being chanted by a chain gang. The stomping drumbeat and jubilant handclaps support a vocal that faces the scales of judgment; in balance between self-recrimination and salvation. \u201cBrother you ain\u2019t so broken / Sister you ain\u2019t so small / Everybody goes together / Or nobody goes at all.\u201d\n\nThe folk hymn Grief and Praise was inspired by writer Martin Prechtel who maintains that \u201cgrief is praising those things we love and have lost, and praise is grieving those things we love and will lose\u201d. It sums up the philosophy of the record in no uncertain terms: \u201cFor all that you love will be taken some day / By the angel of death or the servants of change / In a floodwater tide without rancor or rage / So sing loud while you're able / In grief and in praise\u201d\n\nSwallowed by the New is full of the inviting melodies that\nhave always marked Phillips\u2019 work, while his singing reaches a new degree of intimacy and immediacy. The arrangements hint at country, soul, folk, rock and classic pop, without ever sounding derivative. The emotions may be raw, but they are guided by Phillips\u2019 steady vocals towards healing and renewal.\n\nPhillips started Toad the Wet Sprocket in 1986, when he was still in high school. He was as surprised as anyone when their low-key folk rock landed them on the pop charts. When the band members decided to go their separate ways, Phillips began a solo career with Abulum followed by Winter Pays for Summer, Mr. Lemons and Secrets of the New Explorers. Always open to new projects and unlikely collaborations, he\u2019s toured and recorded with Works Progress Administration, a band that included members of Nickel Creek, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Elvis Costello\u2019s Attractions; Mutual Admiration Society with Nickel Creek; Remote Tree Children, an experimental project with John Askew and Plover, with Neilson Hubbard and Garrison Starr.\n\nHis acoustic duo tour to support Swallowed by the New starts in October and will continue through the spring of 2017. \u201cI enjoy the spontaneity of acoustic performance, where I can take the show wherever it needs to go and follow the lead of an audience instead of following a set list. There\u2019s more talking, more stories, and more of a loose feel. The subject matter is on the serious side, but I feel like the perspective is ultimately positive. Life is about changes, no matter how we may try and pretend otherwise. This album is all about learning how to face change.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Sammy Johnson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8939288.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Fri Feb 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-07", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, Soul, Scat Jazz, Funk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "Australian-native, New Zealand-bred Sammy Johnson (aka Sammy J) currently resides in Los Angeles.

We bring outside influences like Earth Wind & Fire and Brass Construction, trying to interpret a different song for every genre, and make it all our own sound.\u201d With a founding core of five New Orleans natives, New Breed Brass Band made its street debut as a nine-man unit in November 2013 at the Nine Times Second Line. Since then, they have showcased their originality opening for such diverse bands as The Fray, Red Baraat, Dr. John, The Waterboys, and Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, as well as competing in the Red Bull Street Kings brass band competition in 2013.

Paired with introspective lyrics that echo both bitter and sweet, her music will captivate you then stay with you. \u201cMoen is one of those rare artists whose voice, from the first moment you hear it, consumes your entire being, doing away with all previous thoughts and concerns, and leaving you short of breath (The Culture Trip).\u201d\n\nOn her sophomore LP A Million Miles Away, Moen tackles the complexities that coincide with the basic need for growth. At points lighthearted and somber, and even wry, her lyrics mirror what it's like to be alive: to wake up each day and attempt to balance the myriad of emotions that go along with being human. In \"Triple Scoop\" this all perfectly comes together in relation to the age-old problem of sweet, melting ice cream meeting concrete (\"Triple scoop sorbet splattered on the sidewalk / Bit of cherry pie hanging off your lip / Why wipe it away, it's just you and me talking? You're the cherry on top of my double chocolate chip\"). Throughout the album's eight songs, you are reminded that it's possible (and ok!) to feel broken and carefree, nostalgic and hopeful, to be utterly content but still have an incredible sense of longing.\n\nHailing from the small town of Vinton, Iowa located in the middle of the heartland, Moen taught herself how to play guitar as a teenager. It was peer pressure that caused her to write her first song and shortly thereafter, she immersed herself in the writing community of Iowa City while finishing up her studies in French and Spanish at the University of Iowa. Inspired by a mix of modern artists such as Alabama Shakes, Sharon Van Etten, Angel Olsen and Lake Street Dive (who she has supported), and older influences like Stevie Nicks and Joni Mitchell, Moen isn\u2019t locked into a single style.\n\nOn A Million Miles Away her songs shift fluidly; Opener \u201cRed\u201d and \u201cBest I Can Do\u201d portray the soulful side of her voice while \u201cTriple Scoop\u201d and \u201cMatilda\u201d recall folky, summer pop. \u201cDon\u2019t Say I\u201d and \u201cBad to Myself\u201d pull in heavier tones, augmented by her 1968 Gibson ES-340, while the final tracks, \u201cTime is a Shitty Friend\u201d and \u201cPlanetarium,\u201d act as closing arguments for the album. The two tracks encapsulate aspects of each preceding track, at times both heavy and soft - equal parts whimsy (\u201cCuz I\u2019m high and I\u2019m reading about stars and shit\u201d) and sadness (\u201c...and it\u2019s feeding / My thoughts about us together in some other universe\u201d), while the echo of a longing to be \u201ca million miles away\u201d plays out.\n\nA Million Miles Away follows Moen\u2019s 2016 (self-titled EP) and 2017 (That\u2019s All I Wanted LP) releases that took her on tour throughout the Midwest and Western United States alongside Europe. During this time she has acted as direct support for Lake Street Dive, Margaret Glaspy, Lucy Dacus, Houndmouth, William Elliott Whitmore (featured on her 2017 LP), and has had her music placed in films including the Netflix original movie \u201cCandy Jar.\u201d In support of her new album, Moen will embark on her first national headlining tour with dates in major cities including Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Denver, and Nashville. The tour will kick off with a live set for Iowa Public Radio, the state\u2019s NPR affiliate.\n\nDue to release September 1, Moen\u2019s new album is a testament to its theme: growth. A Million Miles Away is a moving, passionate exploration of internal and external change. In Moen\u2019s own words, \u201cthe base of the eight tracks revolves around the idea that there needs to be and will be growth. That can be for someone you love, for yourself, for a new relationship, or for closure from an old one. I\u2019ve grown a lot writing these. I hope that these songs will make you feel that way or another too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoen transfigures folk into an experience in the totality of instruments.

With equal appeal to the fuzz-box mercenaries, stoner-rockers safety meeting in a \u201974 Chevy van, and horns-thrusting metalheads pressed against the stage, this band refuses to conform or brandish a manufactured label. Showing the maturity and confidence to explore the full gamut of their influences and what inspires them internally, ZED is set to offer their third full-length album \u201cTrouble In Eden\u201d with an August 26th release date on Ripple Music. \u201cTrouble In Eden\u201d is a literal collection of blood, sweat, and tears crafted together with raw, personal, relative lyrical content.

Drawing from their varied influences ranging from classic \u201970s rock, punk/hardcore, metal and old school funk, ZED writes music that grabs you, throws you around and grooves you all at once. The band has been likened to \u201ca pissed off Led Zeppelin with Chris Cornell meets Ian Astbury on vocals,\u201d ZED writes songs that linger in your head long after you listen to them. ZED independently released their sophomore album Desperation Blues in May of 2013, which garnered critical acclaim as well as charting on CMJ throughout the summer. Supporting the album up and down the west coast, ZED has played consistently through the fall of 2014 when they began focusing on writing their follow up to Desperation Blues, Trouble In Eden, which is also their debut for Ripple Music. ZED is excited and proud to be a part of the Ripple Music family and look forward to making heads bob and asses shake in 2016 and beyond. ZED is Heavy. ZED is Heavier.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 9:45 AM SHOW: 10 PM\nNO meet and greet available"}, {"Address": "201 Washington St, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Tentacle", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/193114.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.643119, 38.23494], "Date": "Fri Feb 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Phoenix Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Whole in the Wall Gang | Parasox | Tentacle & friends"}, {"Address": "1161 S.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "doors at 7:30pm show at 8pm\n\nPremiere seating and Meet and Greet tix available."}, {"Address": "221 Park Rd, Burlingame, CA 94010", "Artist": "Roem Baur", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7295746.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.346266, 37.577518], "Date": "Fri Feb 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-07", "Genre": "Genres: Soul-Blues, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Vinyl Room", "moreBioInfo": "Roem Baur is a multiple award-winning touring songwriter and San Francisco resident.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose.

Since then the Essex based DJ and producer has taken on a journey of energy, creativity and unconditional passion and even bagged himself an overall number one on Beatport. It\u2019s this passion that has been the drive and motivation behind Max\u2019s flawless production, extensive versatility and limitless capabilities. Just 8 months into his DJing career Max started up his own label, Resonance Records. To this day he still maintains his imprint, placing himself at the helm of showcasing exciting new talent from every corner of the globe. Utilising his resources, the label has since blossomed into a monumental platform for the finest underground tech-house music, and as a result, some of the artists involved are playing at the biggest parties in the world, week in, week out. Storming through Continents such as North and South America, Australasia and Europe is now the norm. On a weekly basis he\u2019s ploughing through set after set and pleasing all his fans. Space, Sankeys and Privilege are just some of the venues amongst the plethora of places Max has performed at and with lots planned for this year the sky is the limit. Max's track 'Body Jack' climbed the Beatport Tech House chart pretty quickly and once into the top 100 it was unstoppable, reaching the top spot after 10 days of being released. It then went n to claim the overall number 1 across all genres a a few days later. Releasing tracks and EPs on WOW!, Hot Creations, Snatch, Elrow, Lost, Madtech, Resonance and VIVa is now becoming a regular occurrence; earlier in 2016, Max was the only producer to have two tracks featured on VIVa\u2019s compilation album, with \u2018Freaks Come Out\u2019 charting the highest out of the whole record. Not content with that, his debut album \u2018Catch Me If You Can\u2019 was given a 9/10 from Mixmag and DJ Mag, as well as hitting number 10 in the Beatport chart. Not only has he taken his sound to the airwaves with a residency on Pioneer Radio, he ticked a huge industry box with a set at Lost Beach club in Ecuador, as part of the Boiler Room network, which was the first ever Boiler Room in Ecuador and was streamed worldwide to thousands of people. It\u2019s easy to see why Adam Beyer, Riva Starr, Steve Lawler, Jamie Jones, Richy Ahmed, Hot Since 82, Loco Dice, Matthias Tanzmann, Pete Tong, Nic Fanculli and many more of the biggest names in the business are giving these tunes a spin on a weekly basis.", "otherInfo": "Repopulate Mars Showcase lands at The Midway on Friday 2 / 7 / 20 | Tables & Bottle Service available: Contact Ticketing@themidwaysf.com |// Line-up // Lee Foss LatmunLauren LaneMax ChapmanProk & Fitch Doors & Music @ 9:00 pm 21+ Event The Midway 900 Marin Street, San Francisco, Ca 94124"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Alone & Together", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Fri Feb 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "General Admission.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music.

It\u2019s a soundtrack for struggle, which is where soul music came from in the first place. That the struggle has been happening largely in the black community is not lost on Pirani, who is white \u2014 it\u2019s something he thinks about a lot. \u201cI feel really strongly that soul music is precious and must be treated with care and respect,\u201d he says. \u201cAnything less is colonizing the funk.\u201d That brings us to another crucial point: real soul can\u2019t be faked \u2014 it\u2019s an expression of self that is so much more than mimicry of the sounds that have come before. \u201cIt\u2019s called soul music,\u201d Pirani says. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to sing from your heart and your soul and not your record collection.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what he does on How Do I Talk to My Brother? Make no mistake: Pirani has a lock on the sound and feel of soul music on his Colemine Records debut. The album contains 11 deeply felt tracks with echos of vintage soul in the vocal harmonies, the way the songs sit back in a deep pocket and Pirani\u2019s unerring instinct for stick-inyour- head hooks. Yet he isn\u2019t just rummaging around in the past on How Do I Talk to My Brother? The New York-via-Chicago singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist brings a contemporary context to his music: He\u2019s writing about what he sees going on all around him, and his reaction to it, be it racism, love, war, poverty or politics.\n\n\u201cThe music has a message. if you listen for it, it\u2019s there. I think that\u2019s important because soul music without a message isn\u2019t soul music.\u201d Pirani says. \u201cArt is political. If your music doesn\u2019t come with some level of cultural understanding, then it\u2019s just pastiche.\u201d\n\nAll of it comes from the heart, from the soul, and also a little bit from Pirani\u2019s blood. Raised by musician parents in the post-industrial Maywood neighborhood in Chicago, Pirani grew up around music: his father was a jazz musician who also did session work on soul records, including Terry Callier\u2019s 1972 opus Occasional Rain, and his mother was a conservatory-trained singer. Pirani\u2019s parents were the music directors at a Pentecostal church, but his world truly opened up when a family friend gave Pirani the entire Beatles catalog and a five-piece Ludwig drum kit. He got into punk in high school, dropped out and went on the road as a drummer, coming home to play in various bands in Chicago, rediscovering soul in the dusty record storesand, eventually, moving to New York.\n\n\u201cPunk embodies a lot of the same spirit to me as soul does,\u201d Pirani says. \u201cIt was about people\u2019s hopes and dreams, love and loss, unless you were on Motown, it was an underground thing. And punk was the same thing.\u201d\n\nHow Do I Talk to My Brother? is in many ways a catalog of Pirani\u2019s own hopes and dreams. Making the album followed what Pirani calls \u201ca personal renaissance\u201dwhich is the subtext of \u201cNot One More Tear,\u201d a pulsing, horn-laced anthem to perseverance. \"I basically decided to get my shit together and take music seriously. getting married and cleaning up my act was a big part of that.\"\n\nAll the same, New York at first was a hard place to make music, and more than one promising project fell apart. He found initial success in 2016 with a 7-inch single, \u201cLight of My Life\u201d b/w \u201cDreamin\u2019s for Free,\u201d which became a sought-after item on the Northern soul scene in Britain. Things moved much faster once he linked up with Colemine, and though How Do I Talk to My Brother? has been a long time coming, it\u2019s coming out at a perfect time.\n\n\u201cComing together to listen to music is revolutionary\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can harness that energy, that togetherness and camaraderie maybe we can make a change in this world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Ben's Little Red Songbook is my"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Stuart Bogie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9734727.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Fri Feb 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-07", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Indie, Rock, Avant-Garde, Folk, Experimental, Improvisation", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Stuart Bogie was born in Evanston, Illinois and studied music at the University of Michigan and Interlochen Art Academy.

The talented singer and songwriter was always surrounded by music from an early age. His father is veteran reggae singer Jimmy Riley. Riley has learnt a lot by merely being in the environment of the music business. He caught on very quickly and made his recording debut as a teenager. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved music; I used to deejay but everyone used to encourage me to sing. They used to call me \u201cSingy Singy\u201d because I was always singing,\u201d Riley commented. In 2004, Tarrus released his debut album, Challenges. \u201cI was fortunate to have recorded my debut album with an independent label out of Miami\u201d. The secret to his success is quite simple \u2013 \u201cwhen preparation meets opportunity\u201d, stated a self-assured Riley. \u2018I sing for the people - this is the contribution I can make and after I make a song; it isn\u2019t even mine anymore; it belongs to the people.\u201d Known for his \u2018healing\u2019 music, Tarrus released his sophomore album Parables in 2006 to widespread acclaim and spawned hit singles - \u201cStay With You\u201d, \u201cBeware\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s Royal\u201d, \u201cLion Paw\u201d, among others. \u201cI worked on Parables with Dean Fraser and I wasn\u2019t surprised at the success it has had, but how fast it all happened\u201d, Riley reflected. \u201cI\u2019ve known Dean a long time and to work with him on something as great and historic as Parables, is an honour\u201d, he also said. \u201cParables was a confidence builder and has set the foundation for everything else that I will bring to my audience\u201d. \u201cI define myself so I make thought-provoking music about Black consciousness and experiences. I want to open people\u2019s minds and let them think. My music isn\u2019t prejudiced towards colour, class, creed or nationality,\u201d he explained passionately. \u201cI target women and children with my music because slavery tampered with the woman\u2019s mind and that\u2019s why I wrote She\u2019s Royal. She\u2019s the head of the household so she has the power to influence the young men and women of tomorrow,\u201d Riley added. Tarrus works with a group of friends on a movement proudly titled BLAKSOIL \u2013 Bredren Living According King Selassie-I Overstanding & Iritical Livity. Through this movement, Riley hopes to further target the consciousness of our women and children. Riley has consistently racked up awards for his work. Among his accolades are Best Singer, Male Vocalist, Cultural Artiste, Song of the Year, and Best Song. Some of the awards institutions which have rewarded Riley include the Youth View Awards, The Star People\u2019s Choice Awards, EME Awards, and the Reggae Academy awards. Said Riley, \u2018I have received awards both locally and internationally. But to be honest, the best award I receive consistently is from the people themselves \u2013 when I can look in their faces and see the impression my music has made \u2013 that is the best award I can ever get\u2019. Nonetheless, Tarrus is the proud holder of CVM\u2019s 15th Anniversary Award, held in February 2009, for the \u2018Most Admired Song in the Past 15 Years\u2019 for the hit, \u201cShe\u2019s Royal\u201d. \u201cThat award really means a lot to me because it was chosen by the people in the streets,\u201d said Riley. In 2009 Riley released his third opus Contagious on Cannon Production. The album was distributed by VP Records. It contained the hits Start Anew, Contagious, Good Girl Gone Bad featuring Konshens and Superman, a cover of a Robin Thicke original. 2010 saw the release of the chart topper Protect the People, which scaled several charts in Jamaica and across the Caribbean. Early 2011 saw the release of the Black History themed Shaka Zulu Pickney which was featured on the Nyabingi rhythm from Bombrush Music. The video for the song which was directed by Storm Saulter was well received upon its release. His interest in educating the youth about Black History resulted in the Tarrus Riley Freedom Writers Competition, which ran on Jamaica\u2019s Irie FM radio station. 2011 also saw the release of videos for hit singles including Come Ova and Never leave I. Both songs have become anthems on Jamaican radio as well as in several Caribbean territories. Riley has performed on several stages around the world. His performances have drawn credible reviews from the media in the Caribbean, North America, the United States and Europe. Riley tours Europe once each year, performing on the major reggae festivals in several European countries. Riley\u2019s most recent high profile performances include the 2011 Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival, Reggae Sumfest 2010, Betty Wright and Friends in concert in Jamaica, and the Palmyra Foundation\u2019s Fundraising event. Among his accolades in 2011 were the EME Awards (Excellence in Music and Entertainment) for Vocalist of the Year Male and Cultural Artiste of the Year. Riley also copped the 2011 Youth View Award for Cultural Artiste of the Year. Riley released the acoustic album Mecoustic (Soulbeats Records) in 2012. He toured Europe between April and May 2012 to promote the album. In 2013 he walked away with two IRAWMA awards. The Best Male Vocalist, and Most Cultural/Educational Entertainer for 2012. His \u201cGimmie Likkle One Drop\u201d was added to BBC\u2019s 1Xtra\u2019s Official Playlist. This means the song will not only be played during reggae or dancehall segments, but will also be played everyday throughout the day. \u201cThis is a huge accomplishment for reggae music\u201d, says David Rodigan. Shane Brown of Juke Boxx Productions, joined Dean Fraser as core members of the management team in April 2013. According to Fraser \"All we really did was to make a little adjustment and interject Shane into the team\". In February 2014, Tarrus released \u201cLove Situation\u201d The album Love Situation is produced by Dean Fraser for Cannon, assisted by talents such as Shane C Brown of Juke Boxx Productions, Mitchum \u2018Khan\u2019 Chin and Jordan McClure. The project was mixed by Shane C Brown and Romel Marshall and mastered by Grammy award winning engineer Michael Fuller. The tracks Burn My Desire, Dem A Watch, Thank You, Cry No More, Special Occasion and Sail Away featuring the Godfather of Deejays, U Roy are all above average and are testimony to the fact that despite the debauchery and violence that some of Jamaica\u2019s younger entertainers prefer to offer up as \u2018music\u2019, hope is still on the horizon and Reggae is very much alive and kicking. The album also features collaborations with another veteran deejay Big Youth and Mr Checks. To share the same space with Tarrus Riley is to realise that humility and positively are two of his strong attributes. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be good. I am just a different person. I try to be positive. I get my inspiration from the people, the teachings of my mother and father. Inspiration is actually In Spirit Action that\u2019s what the word means,\u201d he said. Reggae music earns billions in US dollars annually but sadly, less than one per cent of that profit finds its way to Jamaica. Riley recognises that much needs to be done in order to repatriate the business of Reggae to the land of its birth. He is of the view that local stakeholders need to invest more in the music in order to gain more benefits and essentially assist in building Jamaica\u2019s economy. \u201cThe mindset has to change. The whole attitude towards music has to change. I don\u2019t think we appreciate what we have. It a career and I take it seriously. When we see others do something we bawl and say they are taking our things but its because they appreciate what we do. Everybody wants to do the right thing,\u201d he said we bawl and say they are taking our things but it\u2019s because they appreciate what we do. Everybody wants to do the right thing,\u201d he said. Riley toured the US promoting the album in February and is back on the road in the US again in June. In August he will tour the United Kingdom and Europe later this year.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE.

Dean Wareham recruits Justin Harwood (ex-Chills) on bass and Stanley Demeski (ex-Feelies) on drums to record Lunapark for Elektra Records. After completing the album, the band places an ad in the Village Voice and thus discovers guitarist Sean Eden. Eden, who is Canadian by birth and a trained actor, plays lead guitar on the excellent Indian Summer EP (aka the Slide EP).\n\n1993. The band records their second album, Bewitched, featuring \u201cCalifornia,\u201d \u201cTiger Lily\u201d and \u201cFriendly Advice\" and with a guest appearance from the Velvet Underground\u2019s Sterling Morrison.\n\n1995 Luna\u2019s classic third album, Penthouse (1995) is recorded in New York City, featuring guests Tom Verlaine (Television) and Laetitia Sadier (Stereolab). The band signs to Beggar\u2019s Banquet in Europe. Rolling Stone calls the album \u201cone of the essential recordings of the \u201890s.\u201d\n\n1996 Stanley Demeski departs and Lee Wall takes over on drums. Lee had worked at RPM studios where Luna frequently recorded, and his name was put forward by his friend Sean Eden. The two had crossed paths at North Carolina School of the Arts (Wall studying music theory and Eden the thespian arts). In 1997 the band records Pup Tent, their fourth album for Elektra, again with producer Pat McCarthy.\n\n1998 Luna recorded their fifth album The Days of Our Nights, produced by Paul Kimble (Grant Lee Buffalo).\n\n1999 Justin Harwood moves back to his home country (New Zealand), and is replaced on bass by Britta Phillips, ex of Ultrababyfat and known to some as the singing voice of the cartoon character Jem.\n\n2000 finding themselves between contracts, the band quickly records a live album \u2014 Luna Live! for the Arena Rock label.\n\n2002 the band sign to Jetset Records, record Romantica, co-produced by Gene Holder (DB\u2019s) and Dave Fridmann (Mercury Rev). Romantica was followed by the mini-LP Close Cover Before Striking.\n\n2004 Luna record their Rendezvous album in Brooklyn, NY.

Both of these disparate strands filtered through a lifetime on the run and on the search for a universal truth from psychedelic Brazilian forests to US college campuses and further into his own unique vision. JL Stiles has a mind that sees music in a similar way to how J.S. Bach saw music, however, Bach never played the blues.\n\nFact # 1: JL Stiles is the John Nash of music.\n\nJL Stiles was born with hardwiring most only dream about, a brain that could look at the most basic picture and convert it to it's numerical basics. All through school in rural Connecticut it was clear where he was going to be, working at the cutting edge of mathematics, as he took to the abstract shapes and numbers as a duck would take to proverbial water, until, that is, a band wearing grease paint, Cuban heels, questionable body hair and several pints of fake blood rolled into JL's particular little town: Kiss. A 12 year old JL was hooked by the devils fishing rod that was rock and/or roll and when his brother brought home a terrible guitar from college and left it when he went back, JL had the tools to begin his assault on the world.\n\nHe began fashioning songs using the simple chunking and melody of Jimmy Reed and sub-Rush lyrics about the challenging political world as seen by a 13-year old kid. Quick introductions to the lyrics of Bob Dylan, the power and message of The Who and the space-age ass funk of Parliament, shaped his musical balloon in new ways and JL, taking his John Nash brain and applying it to the one piece of equipment he had at his disposal, a useless dime store guitar, realized pretty quickly that he better maximize the algorithmic potential of the pathetic instrument by learning to pick each and every string independently and simultaneously with the dexterity of a perfect machine and the re-incarnated soul of a genius blind bluesman who strangely disappeared in the early 1930's. That blind genius would be the little known 20's & 30's virtuoso, Blind Blake, who JL heard by accident, floating in from the radio of his father while studying late one night on a mathematical problem involving fourier transformations. He rushed to the transistor just quickly enough to catch the name and his future was born. (He also finished the problem that night in case you wondered).\n\nFact #2: JL Stiles is the freakiest white fingerpicking guitarist in this great country right now.\n\nStiles carried on in his twin disciplines, learning Banach spaces and homology at college by day and wearing out his Blind Blake records at night, studying under the tutelage of the great Laszlo Fuchs, pioneer of abelian group theory, whilst writing hundreds of songs, each one getting gradually better than the last. Both strands were equal to him as he searched for the big picture in whatever way he could.\n\nBut something began to happen; as the songs got better and began to get attention, especially from the ladies, and JL realized that, Fuchs aside, a lot of academicians can be big dicks with fragile egos, he began to drift toward the more standard methods of soul searching for a young guy in late 20th century America: LSD, pot and anything other.\n\nHanging out in the blazing heat studying with Chinese Mathematicians, drifting into oblivion on opium and psychedelics, JL knew the music was more than a sideshow to a brilliant career in the outer reaches of theoretical math. It was, in fact, his calling, and one where he could teach the beauty of what is so perfect about math and blues, the abstract.\n\nImagine a wild-eyed, half-crazed math prodigy with the most dexterous fingers on earth, channeling the spirit of a mysterious blind blues genius who unexplainably vanished, and you are approaching where JL found himself at this juncture in his life.\n\nFact #3: The search for the fundamentals is the same in music as it is in math: The fingerpicking guitar opens up infinite possibilities\n\nBut what would he do with this burden? He wasn't just a singer-songwriter with a cute heartbreak song and a big white smile; he was the walking soul of mathematical fundamental principles driven into the ground by the spirit of the blues. Where could a young boy like this go? To the home of voodoo, New Orleans.\n\nIn an out of the coffee houses and clubs of New Orleans and Mississippi, JL spooked the audiences up and down and left and right, he cut a solo set of songs, just him and a guitar, that rang as clear and true as Blind Blake had 80 years earlier and he knew he had to get out there and spread the theory around.\n\nHe traveled to Mexico and Brazil, Amsterdam and Scandinavia, he lived in the woods for weeks at a time, writing new songs and trying to define a unifying mathematical and musical theory in homological algebra, he went to the brink and stared at the abyss and then he came back with songs in hand to deliver the message back to us dear souls who hadn't made the journey.\n\nHe found a spiritual home in san Francisco and immediately picked up on the musical community there. He played with Etta James in front of 6,000 in front of the courthouse in Riverside, he opened for the great Keb Mo, Leon Redbone, JJ Cale, John Hammond, he knew he was in the right place at the right time, and so, here he is.\n\nFact #4: What JL Stiles is writing now is the best he's ever written and is closer to the fundamental truth of bringing the past together with the future into a musical singularity than he's ever gotten.\n\nFact #5: JL Stiles believes he has come up with the algorithm for the pure heart of music.\n\nJL Stiles is a unique animal (as we have stated before), he believes that the soul of 1920's blues, c.400 BC Greek mathematicians and 21st century artists like Animal Collective (get ready for JL's incendiary cover of AC's \"No More Runnin\") can all be unified into his singular vision. Can he do it? With his head for numbers, I certainly wouldn't bet against him.", "otherInfo": "JL Stiles with the harmony singing of Melissa Jones, Sarah Iyer and Yunoka Berry."}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Rudy Trubitt", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Patchwork Series: Alphabet Rockers (2pm)"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Chris Pureka", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9303628.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "San Francisco House Concert", "moreBioInfo": "Chris Pureka is a singer songwriter based in Portland, OR who has been releasing albums and touring consistenly since 2004.

With an uplifting, almost child-like singing voice, he moves seamlessly between guitar & violin, sometimes making tasteful use of live looping to enhance the listening experience.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "922 Machin Ave, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "Devon Baldwin", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9846380.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.568671, 38.106624], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "City of Novato", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "144 Taylor St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Gutter Swan", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9919845.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.41066, 37.783936], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Acoustic", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "PianoFight", "moreBioInfo": "Gutter Swan is a San Francisco based Americana duo, featuring the emotive vocals of Loryn Barbeau and the complex yet disarming guitar of Steve Egelman.\n\nSteve and Loryn bonded over a love of music, whiskey and punctuality, and thus Gutter Swan was born.\n\nGutter Swan just released their debut album, \"where the dark and the light mingle\".", "otherInfo": "We're play 2 sets from 5:30-7:30pm.

Mystic shaman, protest singer, revolutionary hero, everyday metalhead, furious consumer of heavy music of all shades, husband, father, leader, songwriter\u2026 Cavalera reigns as the adoptive tribal chief of a generation of fans, stretching from the roughest slums of South America to the coldest confines of Russia. Anywhere that people are disenfranchised, the songs of SOULFLY serve as their anthems.\n\n\n\nArmed with Cavalera\u2019s four-stringed guitars, unmistakable growl and instantly recognizable riffage, the muddy tones and constant rhythmic bounce of SOULFLY has retained its gritty edge while pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in metal. \u00bbSavages\u00ab represents a career-defining moment, solidifying the lineup with longtime lead guitarist Marc Rizzo (who has been in SOULFLY almost as long as Max was in SEPULTURA), bassist Tony Campos (Static X, Ministry, Prong) and Max\u2019s 21 year-old Zyon, who splits his time between drumming in LODY KONG and now SOULFLY.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of the things that make SOULFLY killer are combined in Savages,\u201d Max declares.\n\n\n\n\u00bbSavages\u00ab melds the most brutal, the heaviest and overall the most vibrant components that made up each record in SOULFLY\u2019s diverse catalog. By Max\u2019s own account, \u00bbSavages\u00ab is possessed of the tribal groove of the first two SOULFLY albums, particularly in songs like \u2018Bloodshed\u2019, \u2018Ayatollah of Rock \u2018N\u2019 Rolla\u2019 and \u2018Master of Savagery\u2019. But there\u2019s also the thrash metal that was found on DARK AGES and OMEN; whereas the CAVALERA CONSPIRACY records contain short, punky bursts, the new SOULFLY record gets into the epic length territory of early METALLICA. The death metal vibe of SOULFLY\u2019s \u00bbEnslaved\u00ab emerges in songs like \u2018Fallen\u2019 and \u2018Cannibal Holocaust\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cI really like the name \u00bbSavages\u00ab. I like single words that sound powerful, like \u2018Primitive\u2019, \u2018Roots\u2019, \u2018Arise\u2019,\u201d Max explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about the human condition right now. We have the Internet and we\u2019re working on missions to Mars, but we are still decapitating each other and blowing up marathons. We\u2019re still savages. Even with technology and how far we\u2019ve come in the world, our spirit is still that of a savage.\u201d\n\n\n\nA trailblazing pioneer and musician with millions of albums sold who nevertheless retains boundless street cred due to his grimy, raw and undeniable authenticity; Max Cavalera is one of the most prolific artists the realm of heavy music has ever known. There\u2019s CAVALERA CONSPIRACY, which reunited Max with his brother and former bandmate, Igor Cavalera. There was the brutal attack of NAILBOMB, Max\u2019s collaboration with Alex Newport from FUDGE TUNNEL, which included members of DEAD KENNEDYS, FRONT LINE ASSEMBLY, BIOHAZARD and NEUROSIS on-stage. There\u2019s his forthcoming band with members of THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN, MASTODON and THE MARS VOLTA. Of course, there\u2019s Max\u2019s unassailable work as SEPULTURA\u2019s founder, leading the Brazilian band from their badass lo-fi beginnings, through their era of sophisticated thrash classics, up through the cultural landmark that is \u2018Roots\u2019.\n\n\n\nSOULFLY began almost instantaneously after his departure from the band he founded. The eponymously titled debut \u00bbSoulfly\u00ab sold over 500,000 copies in the United States alone, further expanding upon the tribal foundation of \u2018Roots\u2019 with percussive instrumentation, forays into esoteric sounds and multiple guest performers. Across the seven albums and never-ending tours that followed, Max worked with a who\u2019s-who of the heavy music scene as band mates, guest musicians and touring members, including guys from SLIPKNOT, SLAYER, MEGADETH, DEFTONES, RADIOHEAD, STONE SOUR, CYPRESS HILL, MACHINE HEAD, DEVILDRIVER, FEAR FACTORY, MORBID ANGEL, THROWDOWN, S.O.D., SKINDRED, BORKNAGAR, WILL HAVEN and CATTLE DECAPITATION, among others.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Max\u2019s own self-production, a number of important producers have lent their skills to SOULFLY, including \u00bbRoots\u00ab producer Ross Robinson (KORN, AT THE DRIVE-IN), Toby Wright (Ozzy Osbourne, SLAYER), Andy Sneap (MEGADETH, KILLSWITCH ENGAGE), ex-SOULFLY guitarist Logan Mader (FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH, GORJIA) and Zeuss (HATEBREED, SUICIDE SILENCE) and Terry Date (PANTERA, DEFTONES).\n\n\n\nCavalera asked Date, who had mixed for SOULFLY in the past, to produce the new album. Once studio time with the legendary producer was on the calendar, Max kicked into high gear with the material. Max and Zyon worked on the songs that would comprise \u00bbSavages\u00ab at home. \u201cZyon came up to me and said, \u2018Give me a shot. I\u2019ll play on the record for you. I won\u2019t let you down,\u201d explains the elder Cavalera. \u201cI went into a room with him to jam and it felt great. So I said, \u2018Fuck yeah, let\u2019s do it!\u201d\n\n\n\nGenerally on a SOULFLY album, the drummers would learn the songs in the studio, based on demo recordings from Max. This time, Max had the luxury of working out the songs at home with Zyon. \u201cWe jammed every single day for a month. He knew 90% of the material already when we got into the studio. It reminded me of recording the old Sepultura stuff, like Arise and Chaos A.D., Igor knew exactly what he was going to do before we went into the studio. This was very similar.\u201d\n\n\n\nCavalera says he must\u2019ve written at least 1,000 riffs specifically for \u00bbSavages\u00ab. \u201cThe killer riff is what hooks the whole song together,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me the writing process is about finding the most killer riffs possible. It's a battle; sometimes I struggle with the guitar for hours. You have to throw it down on the floor and take a break. Come back a few hours later. \u2018Let\u2019s try this again, motherfucker!\u2019 Grab it again and go to battle, go to war with the guitar until you get the right riffs.\u201d\n\n\n\nMax points to BLACK SABBATH\u2019s \u2018Symptom of the Universe\u2019 as one of the penultimate riffs of all time, citing SABBATH\u2019s Tony Iommi and METALLICA frontman James Hetfield as among the riff-masters he most admires. \u201cI think of riff making as an art-form. I take it really seriously. I think it deserves more attention. It has such value.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking of riffs, Rizzo came into the band a decade ago and his love of thrash metal, death metal and collaborative spirit has energized Max ever since. \u201cWhen Marc entered Soulfly, it was a drastic change. He's the guitar player I've been looking for my whole life. Andreas [Kisser] and I really clicked when we worked together. I never had that again after that. We had other guys that were cool, but it was never 100% there. When Marc came in, I found it! We\u2019ve developed a great bond since.\u201d Rizzo particularly shines on the opening track on Savages, \u2018Bloodshed.\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s stuff all over the song \u2013 clean guitars, feedback \u2013 he just makes the song better.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampos has a lengthy resume in the world of metal and Max says they bonded over their shared Latino heritage, among other things. \u201cI had this idea about this guy Vargas, a Venezuelan cannibal, they call him \u2018El Comegente.\u2019 He\u2019s the Hannibal Lecter of the Andes. We both read about it. Tony sings some of it in Spanish and I sing in Portuguese. He\u2019s a great bass player too, fucking amazing. Killer bass tones, distortion, all balls-out metal. He keeps this shit real heavy, great tone. It\u2019s great recording with guys who know what they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t have to ask if they know.\u201d\n\n\n\nMax acknowledges the inherent risk in putting a 21 year-old behind the kit for such an important record, but it was a risk he absolutely wanted to take. \u201cTo have my son drumming on the album, that's killer. I like risks. I like to start shit up and see what happens. Even if I fail, at least I knew I tried. Rather than knowing I didn't try at all. To me, that's the bigger failure. It took a little bit of courage to put my son on it. I came to the studio and told Terry there was a young drummer who doesn\u2019t play to a click. Terry knew what to do and Zyon did great. The drums sound amazing.\u201d\n\n\n\nLike all things Max Cavalera, does SOULFLY\u2019s \u00bbSavages is a family affair. Not only does it mark Zyon\u2019s recorded debut with the band, but one of Max\u2019s other kids throws down some vocals in the opening track, \u2018Bloodshed\u2019. \u201cMy son Igor has a killer punk rock voice that reminds me of the old CORROSION OF CONFORMITY days,\u201d Max says. \u201cThe chorus has this old punk style riff, almost like a MISFITS type riff. His voice is killer.\u201d\n\n\n\nLike every SOULFLY album, \u00bbSavages\u00ab contains an impressive guest list comprised of veterans and up-and-comers. CLUTCH\u2019s Neil Fallon turns up on \u2018Ayatollah of Rock \u2018N\u2019 Rolla\u2019, the title of which was inspired by Mel Gibson\u2019s classic Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior movie. Jamie Hanks from I DECLARE WAR brought his high and low deathcore vocals to \u2018Fallen\u2019, a death metal oriented song Max says is in the vein of CANNIBAL CORPSE.\n\n\n\nMitch Harris from NAPALM DEATH contributed vocals to \u2018K.C.S.\u2019 Harris has been around the Cavaleras long enough that there are videos of him changing Zyon\u2019s diapers when SOULFLY\u2019s new drummer was just one month old. \u201cMitch came to the studio just to hang out during a day off from tour,\u201d Max explains. \u201cI'm like, \u2018You ready to sing some shit on this record?\u2019 I put him on the spot. He's like, \u2018Right now?\u2019 I said, \u2018Fuck yeah, let's do it!\u2019 There was one point where we were recording together where he did a scream and I saw his eyeball popping out of his face like a cartoon. I was like, \u2018Dude that was the most metal thing I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nMax continues to consume new music from bands like NAILS, MAN MUST DIE, TRIGGER THE BLOODSHED and I DECLARE WAR, even as he revisits seminal material from METALLICA, SLAYER, C.O.C. and the like, and indulges his penchant for world music, and gets his hands in his other projects and collaborations. It all adds up to a singular, distinct, straightforward and riff-heavy machine known as SOULFLY.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "600 Stockton St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Sam Johnson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9124994.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.406829, 37.791845], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: The California Sound, Pop, Rock, Reggae", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz-Carlton, San Francisco", "moreBioInfo": "Sam Johnson\u2019s love for music goes back to his adolescent years, when he learned Bob Marley and Sublime songs on hand me down instruments, and started a reggae band at his high school in Huntington Beach, California. This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band.

He is equally at home playing with jazz veteran Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish sean-n\u00f3s singer Roisin El Safty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata.

Now \u201cSpyboy\u201d ups the ante by digging deeper into the sound of New Orleans culture and giving it a modern twist. The disc\u2019s largely original material takes advantage of the band\u2019s new horn section to highlight the musicians\u2019 personal ties to the street music of their hometown. \u201cWe wanted to take the roots of what we love about New Orleans brass band music and Mardi Gras Indian music and then voice it in our own way,\u201d says the group\u2019s drummer and founder, Joe Gelini.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition began when African-American men first marched in Native American dress through the streets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras day. The tradition, which includes a host of songs shared among the various tribes, has been kept alive for over a century and today is as vital as ever. Mardi Gras Indians have influenced the biggest names in New Orleans music: The Meters, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, the Neville Brothers, Trombone Shorty and others. The most prominent Mardi Gras Indian today is Monk Boudreaux, the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe, and his grandson J\u2019Wan Boudreaux (who holds the position of Spyboy in the tribe) is stepping up with Cha Wa to propel their culture forward.\n\nJ\u2019Wan joined the group when he was still in high school. At the time, Gelini, then a recent Berklee School of Music grad, had been playing drums for Boudreaux\u2019s grandfather, having learned the traditional Mardi Gras Indian beats from original Wild Magnolias bass drummer Norwood \u201cGeechie\u201d Johnson at Sunday night Indian practices in Uptown New Orleans. As the band evolved, J\u2019Wan emerged as the front man. On \u201cSpyboy,\u201d Boudreaux\u2019s vocals (with support from Thaddeus \u201cPeanut\u201d Ramsey\u2019s smooth-voiced Indian style), the booming, funked-up sound of the band\u2019s new four-part horn section, and Gelini\u2019s mix of second line grooves and soulful Indian rhythms have all combined to kindle a new fire in Cha Wa\u2019s ever-developing sound.\n\nAlthough \u201ccha wa\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re comin\u2019 for ya\u201d in Indian vernacular, Boudreaux says the album \u201cSpyboy\u201d is \u201cCha Wa all around\u201d for a different reason. With songwriting contributions to \u201cSpyboy\u201d from band members Joe Maize, Thaddeus \u2018Peanut\u2019 Ramsey, Ari Teitel and Clifton \u2018Spug\u2019 Smith, along with J\u2019Wan and Gelini, Cha Wa ignites an entire new generation with contemporary anthems set ablaze by its high-flying ensemble. Says Boudreaux, \u201cEveryone put their minds together to make this music. Everyone had input on at least one song. And the whole band has a different type of connection these days. Everybody\u2019s bonded now. Everybody\u2019s just having fun\u201d.\n\n\nThe track \u201cGet On Out the Way\u201d -- with its loose, \u201870s funk rhythm, tight horn parts and deep, bouncing sousaphone -- brings that celebratory vibe to life by spiking a traditional Indian phrase with a fast-moving brass band twist.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more serious, social message at work in Cha Wa\u2019s music. Gelini and Monk wrote \u201cVisible Means Of Support\u201d about Monk\u2019s experience with the \u201850s-era Jim Crow vagrancy law used primarily to arrest African-American men. On the J\u2019Wan-penned, big beat-centric \u201cChapters,\u201d the singer tackles more contemporary issues, in this case, the internal struggles he faced while being raised by a single mom.\n\nThe mellow, piano and vocals-only \u201cJ\u2019Wan\u2019s story\u201d sees him taking a different approach to bridging the gap between beauty and harsh reality in New Orleans when he explains, spoken word-style, the basics about how and why Mardi Gras Indian culture developed.\n\n\u201cWe dress up in the Indian suits to pay homage to the Native American Indians, because around the time of slavery, they were the first ones to take us in,\u201d he says, elaborating on the song. \u201cEverything on our suits is handmade -- the beads, the patterns, we sew together pieces of fabric and make the panels, we make the boots -- everything.\u201d\n\nNot that you need a firm understanding of Indian or brass band culture to feel the dance-ready vibrations of Cha Wa\u2019s new music. \u201cIt\u2019s dance music so I think people are attracted to it. Even if people have no idea what the history is, it\u2019s automatically infectious,\u201d Gelini explains. \u201cJ\u2019wan\u2019s the next generation,\u201d the drummer adds. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping this flame lit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "13160 Central Ave, Boulder Creek, CA 95006", "Artist": "Echoes & Artifacts", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9858927.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.121327, 37.124938], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Acoustic, Modern Composition, Folk, Indie, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "lille aeske arthouse", "moreBioInfo": "Echoes & Artifacts is forward-looking acoustic music with deep roots.\n\nFounded in the hills of Northern California by Brooklyn-born singer-songwriter Allyson Makuch and California-raised guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Rory Cloud.

It\u2019s a boundary-breaking, multicolored genre of his very own \u2014 which draws upon the rawness and storytelling abilities of his two biggest musical influences, Johnny Cash and Outkast. His debut EP, Blanco Brown, showcases the full range of its creator, who juggles multiple roles as the project\u2019s songwriter, producer, vocalist, visionary, and multi-instrumentalist.\n\nYears before he rose up the ranks as a Grammy-nominated engineer and major-label solo artist, and one of Billboard\u2019s \u201c7 Country Acts to Watch in 2019\u201d Blanco\u2014 grew up in two very different worlds, both in the state of Georgia, splitting his time between the city projects and the rural countryside. During the school year, he\u2019d spend his months in Atlanta, where the crime that filled his neighborhood was offset by the love and musical connection shared by his family. Every summer, he\u2019d head out of town temporarily moving in with relatives in the small rural town of Butler, GA.\n\nDuring those summers in Butler, the soundtrack that had filled his days back home in Atlanta \u2014 the R&B harmonies he\u2019d sing with his brothers; the rap he\u2019d hear blasting from the cassette players in passing cars; the gospel music he\u2019d howl every Sunday morning in church \u2014 gave way to the laidback, rootsy sounds of Johnny Cash songs and Bobby Blue Bland records. It was there, far away from city life, that Blanco became a fan of Country music. As each summer drew to an end, though, he\u2019d head back to the city, leaving behind the twangy sounds of Butler and returning once again to the projects of Atlanta.\n\nThose two worlds come together with Blanco Brown, an EP that strikes a balance between Blanco\u2019s contrasting backgrounds. A mix of countrified influences and street-smart lingo, the EP finds Blanco dressing up his rapid-fire lyrics and melodic hooks with layers of lap steel, thumping kick drum, harmonica, spoons, tambourine, banjo, synthesizers, 808 percussion, guitar, and plenty of vocal harmonies. The result is a debut EP that\u2019s both urban and rural, blending the sounds of Blanco\u2019s diverse upbringing into the world\u2019s very first trailer-trap project.\n\nBlanco Brown also represents a triumph over adversity. A childhood outcast who spent most of his youth in the hood, Blanco learned to channel his emotions into art at a young age. He drew. He sang. He wrote songs. Years later, he still sees colors whenever he makes music. The songs on Blanco Brown represent a mix of darkness and light, balancing the aggressive, hard-edged narratives of songs like \u201cCountry Time\u201d with upbeat, dance-ready songs like \u201cThe Git Up.\u201d It\u2019s a vivid, vibrant sound \u2014 one that shines a light on Blanco\u2019s loving personality, challenging upbringing, and boundless creativity.\n\nGluing the mix together in Blanco\u2019s voice and detailed storytelling, with each song spinning true-life tales of poverty, relationships, the hood, and the journey to overcome whatever obstacles stand between you and your dream. Although most of those stories come from Blanco\u2019s own experience, they help weave a more universal picture.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think of the sound as being genre-breaking,\u201d he says. \u201cI think of it as being culture-bonding. If you listen to the messages of these songs, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s about the things we go all through as humans, not about race.\u201d\n\nLike many of his songs, \u201cCountry Time,\u201d with its hard-hitting hip-hop bounce and bluegrass-inspired outro, was tracked on Blanco\u2019s laptop, while \u201cDon\u2019t Love Her\u201d was built upon a voice memo that originated on his cell phone. Other songs were created in more traditional studios \u2014 the kind of place that Blanco already knew well, given the years he\u2019d spent working with musicians from across the spectrum. Blanco Brown may be Blanco\u2019s first release as a solo artist in his own right, but he\u2019s no newcomer. Instead, he\u2019s a well-rounded veteran of the recording studio, with his eyes now set on the stage. Over the years Blanco worked as a vocal producer with top name artists like Fergie, Childish Gambino, Chris Brown and Kane Brown to name a few. He also wrote songs for big names like Monica in addition to working as a background singer.\n\n\u201cThis album accentuates one side of what I went through, I can\u2019t forget the hood,\u201d says Blanco, who writes compellingly about his youth on songs like \u201cGhett Ol Memories.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t start out trying to make Country music, but these are the sounds I love\u2014and always keep coming back to time and time again. I don\u2019t believe in people being trailer trash, either, so I want to put a good connotation on that word. Making trailer-trap music really feels liberating to me, because I want to bring people together. That\u2019s what this music stands for: unity. It\u2019s multiple influences and sounds and styles, all coming together.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Stuart Bogie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9734727.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Indie, Rock, Avant-Garde, Folk, Experimental, Improvisation", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "Stuart Bogie was born in Evanston, Illinois and studied music at the University of Michigan and Interlochen Art Academy.

Even with a few hits in the bag, the search takes time, and it might be a few laps around the sun before things get dialed in \u2013 but when that happens it\u2019s like a switch is flipped.\nHeading into his second album for Big Loud Records, aptly titled Laps Around the Sun, that quest for self discovery was heavy on Chris Lane\u2019s mind. Two whirlwind years of chart toppers and jam-packed shows had gone by for the breakout country talent, but the North Carolina native still felt restless. He found himself looking back to his early days, and back to the reasons he fell in love with music in the first place.\n\u201cI had a moment where I played a show with Kenny Chesney,\u201d the lifelong country fan explains. \u201cIt was a festival right on the beach, and I watched him do his thing and I watched the crowd, and there was just something special about that night.

And instead of being lit by streetlights and neon, each song basks in the golden rays of a summer afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a change for me this time around,\u201d Lane says. \u201cBut this is what I truly love.\u201d\nProduced once again by studio ace Joey Moi (FGL), Laps Around the Sun feels more organic, building off the sandy arrangements of artists like Chesney and Billy Currington with an added touch of new- school cool. Lane and Moi recorded with a live band for the first time, fleshed out melodies on guitars rather than computer screens, and eased Lane\u2019s vocal into its timeless natural register.\nFourteen tracks written by hitmakers like Rhett Akins, Ashley Gorley, Hillary Lindsey and The Warren Brothers made the cut \u2013 and in an important lesson learned while Lane put his \u201claps\u201d in on tour, they were all chosen based on meaning and personal connection, not purely on energy or feel.\nThe album\u2019s first single, \u201cTake Back Home Girl\u201d (featuring Tori Kelly) marks Lane\u2019s coming of age. It builds on the sultry swagger of Girl Problems, but he and the Grammy-nominee aren\u2019t singing about a steamy downtown hookup. Instead, the track reveals who Lane really is \u2013 a true country boy with deeply rooted family values \u2013 becoming Lane\u2019s third Gold-certified single in a row.\nThe patient \u201cI Don\u2019t Know About You\u201d charts a similar course \u2013 a hard-crushing, swollen-hearts anthem sure to inspire stadium wide sing alongs \u2013 while \u201cNumber One\u201d takes a soulful look at regret, and \u201cWithout You\u201d adds Danielle Bradbery for some sun-kissed romantic harmony.\nOn \u201cDrunk People,\u201d Lane\u2019s good-natured sense of humor shines bright. The grinning mid-tempo is just smooth enough to not aggravate a hangover headache, but edgy enough to admit that drunk people do dumb things ... like get back together. \u201cThat song is me to a \u2018T,\u2019\u201d Lane says with a laugh. \u201cEvery time I have one to many tequila drinks, I think I\u2019ve gotta FaceTime every girlfriend I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nHe throws some sunny shade on \u201cNew Phone, Who\u2019s This,\u201d a sly, smile-inducing strutter. And likewise, \u201cFishin\u2019\u201d feels as fun and refreshing as a secret honey hole on a hot day. Country to the core, its lyrics recall the innocence of young love \u2013 and the nostalgia of the genre\u2019s most iconic hits. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a great little summer song,\u201d Lane says. \u201cAnd for some reason, it lives in that same place that \u2018Mayberry\u2019 by Rascal Flatts does for me.\u201d\nMeanwhile, \u201cHero\u201d reveals the man Lane has always been, and the artist he\u2019s become. A slow, heartfelt ballad with an openly religious theme of personal conviction, Lane says he knew recording it could be risky, \u201cbut at the same time, there has never been a song that is more true to me.\u201d\n\u201cI really prayed that I would get the song,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if it will ever be a single or anything like that, but it speaks to my heart.\u201d\nStill, Lane named the album Laps Around the Sun for a reason, and the title track reflects how he feels about his journey to the here and now. Supremely relaxed, soulful, and full of mature optimism, it describes a hand-in-hand adventure which could be about Lane and the girl of his dreams ... or it could be about Lane and country fans. Either way, he promises to keep on moving forward, together.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know we\u2019ll never be done / Taking laps around the sun,\u201d goes the chorus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d Lane admits. \u201cWith my first record, I was trying to figure out exactly what kind of sound I wanted to have, and now I know. I know what I truly love and what kind of artist I want to be. My goal was to make sure anyone who hears this album finds a song they can relate to. I hope I accomplished that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Sammy Johnson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8939288.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, Soul, Scat Jazz, Funk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "Australian-native, New Zealand-bred Sammy Johnson (aka Sammy J) currently resides in Los Angeles.

The Ventures' Guitar Freakout, The 50 Guitars of Tommy Garrett and Alvin And The Chipmunks Play The Beatles' Hits all came home on a single fateful day.\n\n\n\nIt didn't hurt, either, that string-meister David Lindley played in a bluegrass band that rehearsed right next door and gave Stevie his very first lessons, or that his dear Granny was a pianist in the heyday of vaudeville and that his sainted mother was a whiz in mandolin orchestras during the 1930s.\n\n\n\nNot even several years of playing Folk Masses every Sunday could quash his musical spirit, and in high school he began fingerpicking, inspired - as so many were - by that first Hot Tuna album.\n\n\n\nAfter securing degrees in Theatre and Theology at Santa Clara University he hit the road for 3 years with The Royal Lichtenstein Circus. Once back home, he signed on as actor and stage manager for The San Jose Repertory Company. He announced killer whale shows. His best friend was an elephant.\n\n\n\nHe and his good pal Roy Zimmerman have worked closely in several collaborations over the past 25 years, including folk tribute / parody band The Foremen and comedy duo The Reagan Bros. in Los Angeles, and while there, Stevie appeared on Cheers and in many television commercials and had a regular role on The Young And The Restless (which was utterly subsumed by then-daily broadcasts of the interminable Iran-Contra hearings.)\n\n\n\nSafely back in the Bay Area, he continued his acting career, doing commercials, radio, voiceovers and films and played in folk duos The Frontmen and The Back Room Boys. In 1999 he co-founded and fronted The Waybacks and toured steadily with them from 2001 through 2007. The band released 4 albums in that time, played major festivals like Merlefest, Grey Fox, Floydfest, Great Waters, Old Settlers, Bumbershoot and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, toured Australia and collaborated with Lloyd Maines, Michelle Shocked and Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead.\n\n\n\nStevie's gone solo now, and is busily booking festivals, venues and house concerts.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing.

He toured the west coast, the midwest, and sporadic shows along the east coast in support of this first release.\n\nIn 2012, he funded his second album using the crowdsourcing platform, Kickstarter.

Fox Parkinson's Research Foundation as a one-year-long campaign to raise money for Parkinson's Research.\n\nThe song is a story about him running away from home in order to become a werewolf, when he was in Elementary School, after seeing the movie \u201cTeen Wolf\u201d starring Michael J. Fox. On July 20th 2017, Mike Vitale re-released \"Running Away From Home\" on all streaming services such Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora. The single was also made available for purchase on all major digital distribution websites including Google Play, iTunes, Amazon Music, and the like.\n\nMike is currently writing, producing, and engineering a new collection of songs to be released in 2018 as both singles and in traditional album format, using the crowdsourcing platform, Patreon, to help fund this artistic endeavor. He is also very active on Youtube, making a consolidated effort to release one new cover or original song, once a week.

Dean Wareham recruits Justin Harwood (ex-Chills) on bass and Stanley Demeski (ex-Feelies) on drums to record Lunapark for Elektra Records. After completing the album, the band places an ad in the Village Voice and thus discovers guitarist Sean Eden. Eden, who is Canadian by birth and a trained actor, plays lead guitar on the excellent Indian Summer EP (aka the Slide EP).\n\n1993. The band records their second album, Bewitched, featuring \u201cCalifornia,\u201d \u201cTiger Lily\u201d and \u201cFriendly Advice\" and with a guest appearance from the Velvet Underground\u2019s Sterling Morrison.\n\n1995 Luna\u2019s classic third album, Penthouse (1995) is recorded in New York City, featuring guests Tom Verlaine (Television) and Laetitia Sadier (Stereolab). The band signs to Beggar\u2019s Banquet in Europe. Rolling Stone calls the album \u201cone of the essential recordings of the \u201890s.\u201d\n\n1996 Stanley Demeski departs and Lee Wall takes over on drums. Lee had worked at RPM studios where Luna frequently recorded, and his name was put forward by his friend Sean Eden. The two had crossed paths at North Carolina School of the Arts (Wall studying music theory and Eden the thespian arts). In 1997 the band records Pup Tent, their fourth album for Elektra, again with producer Pat McCarthy.\n\n1998 Luna recorded their fifth album The Days of Our Nights, produced by Paul Kimble (Grant Lee Buffalo).\n\n1999 Justin Harwood moves back to his home country (New Zealand), and is replaced on bass by Britta Phillips, ex of Ultrababyfat and known to some as the singing voice of the cartoon character Jem.\n\n2000 finding themselves between contracts, the band quickly records a live album \u2014 Luna Live! for the Arena Rock label.\n\n2002 the band sign to Jetset Records, record Romantica, co-produced by Gene Holder (DB\u2019s) and Dave Fridmann (Mercury Rev). Romantica was followed by the mini-LP Close Cover Before Striking.\n\n2004 Luna record their Rendezvous album in Brooklyn, NY. Produced by Bryce Goggin with minimal overdubs, it captures the band more-or-less live.\n\n2005 After a farewell tour, on February 28 the band play their last show at New York\u2019s Bowery Ballroom.\n\n2015 Captured Tracks plans release of vinyl box set comprising Luna\u2019s five albums recorded for Elektra and a bonus LP of rarities.\n\nAfter ten years away, the band announces a commemorative world tour. The lineup is the exact \u201999-\u201905 group: Dean Wareham and Sean Eden on guitar, Lee Wall on drums, and Britta Phillips (now married to Mr Wareham) on bass.\n\n2016 the band start recording an album of covers at Palmetto Recording in Los Angeles, with Jason Quever (Papercuts) co-producing. After completing the covers, and at Sean Eden\u2019s request, they add extra studio time to write and record an EP of new instrumental tracks.\n\n2017 Double Feature Records in partnership with Pledge Music will release the band\u2019s first new material since 2004, the covers LP A Sentimental Education and instrumental EP A Place of Greater Safety.\n\nAt their best, it\u2019s hard to believe there is any other kind of music besides this simple, graceful, chiming chug \u2014 the Guardian\n\nDean Wareham has an unlikely quiver of a voice that, for whatever ungodly reason, sounds as if he\u2019s survived something his music alludes to but never gives away \u2014 Jerry Stahl\n\nOne of indie rocks\u2019 most beloved live acts \u2014 Rob Sheffield, Rolling Stone", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2147 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "John Santos", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.267555, 37.810801], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Sound Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "650 Geary St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Frankie Fictitious", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9164562.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414033, 37.787047], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Alcazar Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Frankie Fictitious is a World Famous Award-Winning Burlesque Sensation based in San Francisco, California\n\n\"Miss Exotic World 2019\" - Burlesque Hall Of Fame\n\"Most Dazzling 2019\" - Burlesque Hall of Fame\nTop 50 Burlesque Industry Figures - 21st Century Burlesque\n\"Miss Viva Las Vegas 2017\" - Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekend\n\"Best Burlesque 2017\" - Arizona Burlesque Festival\n\u201cBest Small Group 2017\u201d- Burlesque Hall of Fame", "otherInfo": "Misfit Cabaret is a splendiferous variety show centered around magical music with a rotating cast of eccentric performers.

Now \u201cSpyboy\u201d ups the ante by digging deeper into the sound of New Orleans culture and giving it a modern twist. The disc\u2019s largely original material takes advantage of the band\u2019s new horn section to highlight the musicians\u2019 personal ties to the street music of their hometown. \u201cWe wanted to take the roots of what we love about New Orleans brass band music and Mardi Gras Indian music and then voice it in our own way,\u201d says the group\u2019s drummer and founder, Joe Gelini.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition began when African-American men first marched in Native American dress through the streets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras day. The tradition, which includes a host of songs shared among the various tribes, has been kept alive for over a century and today is as vital as ever. Mardi Gras Indians have influenced the biggest names in New Orleans music: The Meters, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, the Neville Brothers, Trombone Shorty and others. The most prominent Mardi Gras Indian today is Monk Boudreaux, the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe, and his grandson J\u2019Wan Boudreaux (who holds the position of Spyboy in the tribe) is stepping up with Cha Wa to propel their culture forward.\n\nJ\u2019Wan joined the group when he was still in high school. At the time, Gelini, then a recent Berklee School of Music grad, had been playing drums for Boudreaux\u2019s grandfather, having learned the traditional Mardi Gras Indian beats from original Wild Magnolias bass drummer Norwood \u201cGeechie\u201d Johnson at Sunday night Indian practices in Uptown New Orleans. As the band evolved, J\u2019Wan emerged as the front man. On \u201cSpyboy,\u201d Boudreaux\u2019s vocals (with support from Thaddeus \u201cPeanut\u201d Ramsey\u2019s smooth-voiced Indian style), the booming, funked-up sound of the band\u2019s new four-part horn section, and Gelini\u2019s mix of second line grooves and soulful Indian rhythms have all combined to kindle a new fire in Cha Wa\u2019s ever-developing sound.\n\nAlthough \u201ccha wa\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re comin\u2019 for ya\u201d in Indian vernacular, Boudreaux says the album \u201cSpyboy\u201d is \u201cCha Wa all around\u201d for a different reason. With songwriting contributions to \u201cSpyboy\u201d from band members Joe Maize, Thaddeus \u2018Peanut\u2019 Ramsey, Ari Teitel and Clifton \u2018Spug\u2019 Smith, along with J\u2019Wan and Gelini, Cha Wa ignites an entire new generation with contemporary anthems set ablaze by its high-flying ensemble. Says Boudreaux, \u201cEveryone put their minds together to make this music. Everyone had input on at least one song. And the whole band has a different type of connection these days. Everybody\u2019s bonded now. Everybody\u2019s just having fun\u201d.\n\n\nThe track \u201cGet On Out the Way\u201d -- with its loose, \u201870s funk rhythm, tight horn parts and deep, bouncing sousaphone -- brings that celebratory vibe to life by spiking a traditional Indian phrase with a fast-moving brass band twist.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more serious, social message at work in Cha Wa\u2019s music. Gelini and Monk wrote \u201cVisible Means Of Support\u201d about Monk\u2019s experience with the \u201850s-era Jim Crow vagrancy law used primarily to arrest African-American men. On the J\u2019Wan-penned, big beat-centric \u201cChapters,\u201d the singer tackles more contemporary issues, in this case, the internal struggles he faced while being raised by a single mom.\n\nThe mellow, piano and vocals-only \u201cJ\u2019Wan\u2019s story\u201d sees him taking a different approach to bridging the gap between beauty and harsh reality in New Orleans when he explains, spoken word-style, the basics about how and why Mardi Gras Indian culture developed.\n\n\u201cWe dress up in the Indian suits to pay homage to the Native American Indians, because around the time of slavery, they were the first ones to take us in,\u201d he says, elaborating on the song. \u201cEverything on our suits is handmade -- the beads, the patterns, we sew together pieces of fabric and make the panels, we make the boots -- everything.\u201d\n\nNot that you need a firm understanding of Indian or brass band culture to feel the dance-ready vibrations of Cha Wa\u2019s new music. \u201cIt\u2019s dance music so I think people are attracted to it. Even if people have no idea what the history is, it\u2019s automatically infectious,\u201d Gelini explains. \u201cJ\u2019wan\u2019s the next generation,\u201d the drummer adds. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping this flame lit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "627 2nd Avenue, Crockett, CA 94525", "Artist": "Katie Skene", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9631172.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.223563, 38.053227], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Southern Blues, Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Toot's Tavern Sugartown", "moreBioInfo": "Katie Skene is a blues and southern rock & soul singer, guitarist and songwriter based in Los Angeles, CA.

It was also during this time that the band\u2019s label stateside began lining up synchronization opportunities that sowed the seeds for what was to come.\n\n2008\u2019s self-titled album ushered in an era where the band truly grew a global fanbase, as the record remains their top-grossing title to date and the band was able to graduate to headliner status in large venues everywhere. Toward the end of the album\u2019s initial cycle, Hollywood and the entertainment world at large came calling in a major way, largely sparked by Brad Pitt and director Bennett Miller\u2019s passionate enthusiasm for the band. The duo initially paired THIS WILL DESTROY YOU\u2019s \u201cThe Mighty Rio Grande\u201d to five crucial acts in 2011\u2019s Moneyball, with Villa Del Refugio then going into Pitt\u2019s subsequent World War Z and Miller\u2019s next film Foxcatcher. The licensing landscape exploded from there, as the band and the first two albums were represented across all major sporting events (Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup, Wimbledon, ESPYS, et al), cultural shifts (the UFC\u2019s rollout package for Ronda Rousey), Hollywood\u2019s biggest night (see: Tom Cruise introducing the nominees and awarding \u201cBest Picture\u201d over \u201cThe Mighty Rio Grande\u201d at the 2012 Oscars), and numerous Emmy-award winning dramas on television.\n\n2011 saw a change in rhythm section and an experiment in the darker capacities of the band. Tunnel Blanket features the most raw and visceral material in the band\u2019s catalog. The band stayed on the road (including a meaningful run in direct support of Deftones), issued a triple live album (2013\u2019s Live In Reykjavik, Iceland), and began formulating what would become 2014\u2019s Another Language album, an exemplar of the band and producer John Congleton\u2019s studio prowess.\n\nFrom 2016-2018, the band was able to successfully stage special tenth anniversary shows and tours celebrating Young Mountain and self-titled at high-capacity, sold out gigs around the globe, punctuated by being hand-picked by The Cure to perform in front of tens of thousands at the band\u2019s fortieth anniversary concert in London\u2019s historic Hyde Park. On the front end of that cycle, Galindo and King also managed to successfully pull off writing and recording the ambitious score to the most talked-about new restaurant of 2018, Los Angeles, Calfornia\u2019s Vespertine.\n\nTHIS WILL DESTROY YOU will return to stages this fall on a North American headlining tour. Slated to commence on October 16th in Phoenix, Arizona, the trek will wind its way through over two dozen cities, coming to a close November 17th in San Diego, California.

As inventor and player of The Magic Pipe, That 1 Guy\u2019s show has to be seen to be believed, as he single-handedly (and foot-edly) plays his amazing instrument, made out of miked steel pipes with a single, thick bass string wired from top to bottom, not to mention an Appalachian handsaw, an electric cowboy boot and belching smoke.\n\nCombining elements of classical music with electronica, Silverman puts his classical training to good use creating music that is ethereal, gothic and heart pounding. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty serious,\u201d says Silverman, about his one-man concert performance, equal parts music, technology, science, art and spectacle and suitable for audiences of all ages, as he uses his hands and feet to create an industrial tribal rhythm that must be seen and heard to be believed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to take in. When people see me play, they just intuitively get it.\u201d\n\nThat 1 Guy will launch his spring concert tour at Seattle\u2019s Crocodile Club, with West Coast dates then moving on to festivals throughout the summer. The shows will coincide with the June 26th release of his second album, The Moon is Disgusting, the follow-up to his critically acclaimed Righteous Babe debut, Songs in the Key of Beotch.\n\nThe album was recorded over the summer of \u201906 with veteran Bay Area engineer Karl Derfler, who has previously worked with such eccentrics as Tom Waits, Roky Erickson and Daniel Johnston. \u201cThe album was originally conceived as the soundtrack to an animated film I wanted to make,\u201d he explains. \u201cI love music that takes you on a trip, a journey.\u201d\n\nSilverman has gone on his own world voyage as That 1 Guy, with performances around the globe, Edinburgh, Scotland\u2019s prestigious Fringe Festival, receiving the Tapwater Award for Best Musical Act, as well as Istanbul and Australia, where he is a revered folk hero, regularly selling out venues. \u201cSo much of my music has an indigenous, tribal rhythm feel to it,\u201d he says, explaining his popularity Down Under, where The Magic Pipe is often compared to the Aussie didgeridoo. \u201cAnd there\u2019s this sort of tubular, pipe-shaped vibe that seems to make perfect sense there.\u201d\n\nHis audiences range from psychedelic warriors to families of all ages. Last year, he embarked on a five-week jaunt with Guns N\u2019 Roses guitarist Buckethead in which the two collaborated nightly. \u201cWe really got out there and had a good time,\u201d says Silverman. \u201cHe brought things out of me musically I don\u2019t bring out of myself.\u201d A That 1 Guy concert is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, like taking a trip around the world without leaving your seat.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "148 E.

She can purr, but she\u2019d rather growl and tell you the truth you\u2019ve always known, but tried to hide from yourself. Masha is a rippling stream, an unexpected riptide, a woman who can go with the flow or create her own tsunami. She can illuminate the stage with the force of her personality, or quietly draw you in to her confidence with a soft confession that will touch your heart and make you misty. Masha is a singer and a songwriter, a woman who was born to perform. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t sing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was little, I sang along with the radio. People like Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston, and Christine Aguilera attracted me, strong women who could really belt it out.\u201d Masha took piano lessons as a child, but by the time she was a teen, she was playing guitar, writing songs and playing open mikes. Masha\u2019s father supported his daughter\u2019s musical ambitions. When the family lived in Latvia, he was lead guitarist in the band of Latvian superstar Laima Vaikule. He helped his daughter put together a demo of cover tunes and she was soon hanging out in recording studios and honing her sound. \"I had a double life that I hid from my friends,\" she says. \"As soon as my classes were over, I\u2019d take the bus into the city and work on my music until late in the morning. They wanted to know why I didn\u2019t want to hang at the football games, but I was driven by the music.\u201d \u201cMy style is hard to pin down,\u201d Masha says. \u201cIt\u2019s dirty and grungy and full of contradictions. I like angry, crazy rockers, happy country songs and folk ballads, anything with real emotion.\" While working on her debut album, slated for release later this year, Masha posted cover videos on YouTube, which generated millions of views and established a genuine fanbase. Those numbers will grow with the release of her first single, \"Mr. Presley,\" an homage to the King of Rock & Roll. \"Sure, at first listen, the song is obviously about Elvis,\" she says. \"But it's also a cry of frustration, trying to find that Prince Charming and wondering if he truly exists. I'm a hopeless romantic who believes in happily ever after, but living in a world where people only care about themselves you start to panic that maybe you'll just die alone, and that perfect man that you envision in your head just doesn't exist. I'm putting Elvis on a pedestal and comparing every man to him. Everything about him, his voice, his looks, he was the King. They just don't make men like that anymore.\" The track, and the rest of Masha's upcoming album was co-penned and produced by Claude Kelly and Chuck Harmony, better known as Louis York. The duo, known for their work with artists such as Bruno Mars, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Mary J. Blige, to name but a few, not only worked on Masha's music, they also signed her to their new label Weirdo Workshop. \u201cI\u2019ve known both Claude and Chuck for years, so being able to finally work with both of them at the same time have literally been the best days of my life,\u201d says Masha. \u201cThey\u2019re so much fun. They bring out the artist I was always meant to be. They both know me so well and are the best friends I could ever have, so it\u2019s perfect. And I\u2019m so excited to be on Weirdo Workshop, a company where dreams really do come true. You have a dozen people there with the intention of making your vision a reality. Everyone has your back and no one fights you for creative control. Artistic integrity is always at the forefront. It really is the perfect scenario for an artist.\u201d As for the future, Masha says, \u201cI can't wait to get out on the road.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Ernest", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 8pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Friday January 17"}, {"Address": "1015 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Pura", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/253001.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.405681, 37.778048], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "1015 Folsom", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Pura Reggaeton, Merengue, Salsa, Bachata, Cumbia, Hip Hop, Top 40"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Mestizo Beat", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9058460.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Afro-Beat, Funk, Soul", "Time": "9:15 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "Mestizo Beat is a collective of musicians based out of Los Angeles who compose and perform music influenced by the early 1970\u2019s era of funk, soul, afro-beat, and afro-cuban genre.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 9 PM SHOW: 9:30 PM\nNO meet and greet available"}, {"Address": "1337 Grant Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Hot Pocket", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.407503, 37.799258], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Tupelo", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Hot Pocket at Tupelo: The old Mojito space has reimagined itself in Tupelo, a casually classy restaurant and bar with a menu featuring soul food, burgers, grits-augmented combo plates, and other Southern food staples."}, {"Address": "444 Battery St, San Francisco, CA 94111", "Artist": "Karinda Dobbins", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9903737.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399943, 37.795514], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "9:45 PM", "Venue": "Punch Line Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Comedian, writer, and actor.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "444 Battery St, San Francisco, CA 94111", "Artist": "Phil Griffiths", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9046383.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399943, 37.795514], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "9:45 PM", "Venue": "Punch Line Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Comedian", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "316 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "CID", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7696739.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413792, 37.771362], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: House", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Audio Nightclub", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Sango", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7866069.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, R&b, Beats, Hip-hop, Hip Hop, R&b/soul, Electronic", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "I produce with the love from above & my main inspiration comes from anything and everything.

Under these aliases you\u2019ll find sweeping emotive cuts, verdant dancefloor workouts and discerning dips into jungle and breaks. Releases have come on respected labels including Meda Fury, Ectotherm, UN.T.O and Lobster Fury: the collaborative label from Lobster Theremin and Meda Fury begun for the explicit purpose of releasing his tracks.\n\nDJ Seinfeld\u2019s beats are ultimately guided by an idea of authenticity, true to the spirit of the early house pioneers and the unabashed rawness the confines of their equipment demanded. A lot\u2019s been made of this lo-fi fuzz, with many clamoring to declare it a scene, but he won\u2019t be put into a box. His path is his own. A microphone picks up the tension and release of a singer: charged with emotion, the machine can\u2019t handle it. The rough edges of his productions emit the same sensibility.\nFootage of his gigs or their post-show reaction exemplifies the reception he gets as a DJ. Biographies often claim a DJ regularly \u2018sends crowds into rapture\u2019 or \u2018lays waste to the floor,\u2019 but in DJ Seinfeld\u2019s case pandemonium is the default. Mixes show his deft control of build-up and feel in the booth, while his mini series for legendary London station Rinse FM in May \u2018DJ Seinfeld presents...\u2019, was a master class in the kind of wonky left-field house he peppers his sets with.\n\nArmand began making music in Edinburgh at the suggestion of a respected friend. Time spent experimenting with music and exploring the possibilities contained within his laptop was cathartic relief from the grind of finishing his studies. Later returning to his hometown of Malmo, his interest in making music would intensify thanks to encouragement from his old school friends and a the looming spectre of a 9-5 lifestyle. A move to Barcelona and the end of a relationship resulted in extended sessions watching the classic American sitcom and the music made to reflect that appeared under the name DJ Seinfeld.\n\nRimbaudian already had traction and DJ Seinfeld was really intended as a side-project to exorcise emotions felt at that time. At first, tracks appeared on music-sharing groups online but he didn\u2019t claim ownership, despite the growing buzz. When his friend Courtesy\u2019s label Ectotherm began asking who the mysterious producer was, he began to take note. Then before long, Lobster Theremin and Meda Fury followed suit.\n\nThe point of no return though came one evening spent with Ableton and a few beers. The track \u2018U\u2019 was uploaded to Soundcloud, and the internet went into overdrive. Sampling Bob Geldoff\u2019s account of his split with his wife, amid soaring chants and keys wrought in heartache, \u2018U\u2019 is almost voyeuristic in its honesty.

Although their backgrounds and professional training differs, their common desire to release new productions and contribute to the international club scene is equivalent. Together, they combine their previous experiences and endeavors to launch a fresh and innovative musical journey!\n\nRoberto Intrallazzi began his musical career in the latter part of the 80\u2019s and beginning of the 90\u2019s as part of one of the most successful projects of the \u2018made in Italy\u2019 dance era, F.P.I. Project. Their track \u2018Rich in Paradise\u2019 received worldwide acclaim and was one of the first house music releases to come out of Italy. Over the 90\u2019s decade, his sound evolved into more like \u2018house\u2019 of today with influences from electro of the 80\u2019s. The combination of the strong energy and search for new rhythms typical of the 80\u2019s along with the contemporary minimal-electronic sound further assisted with the development of Roberto\u2019s style.\n\nIn 2000, Roberto Intrallazzi met the DJ and producer, Luca Provera who matched Roberto\u2019s knowledge of music and technology. Luca got involved with music at a very young age by building his own recording studio and becoming familiar with the technicalities of making music. Luca utilized computers, mixers, samplers, and keyboards to launch his career as a producer and sound designer; employing both digital and analog equipment.\n\nLuca later went on to produce a private Italian radio show and together with the artist Intrallazzi produced the album \u2018The Pleasure is All Mine\u2019 by Kym Mazelle. His radio and recording studio know-how led him to quickly gain familiarity with both the software and hardware necessary to produce quality house music. He isn\u2019t just a quality producer however he is also a well-known DJ who plays frequently in alternative venues in Italy and all over the world.\n\n\nDJING:\n\n1 mixer... and 4 hands... playing Back 2 Back!\n\nThe Cube Guys know how to make the dancefloor go wild spawning miraculous moments. Continually striving to bring an animated, floor shaking, and diversified attitude to their productions and performances, The Cube Guys draw inspiration from cutting-edge nuances in technology and the international clubbing community.\n\nCombining house with tech elements and Vocal contributions, The Cube guys steadily persevere to emerge and mature on an international level. Taking part in some of the most eminent and influential parties and clubs globally, The Cube Guys have managed to disassociate themselves from the masses.\n\n\nPRODUCTIONS AND REMIXES:\n\n\nThe Cube Guys sound has traveled all around the globe with recognition from Mark Knight, Pete Tong, Bob Sinclar, Roger Sanchez, Chus & Ceballos, Prok & Fitch, Mike Vale, David Penn, Atfc, Ralph Falcon, Oscar G, Erick Morillo, Dj Boris, David Morales, Hector Romero, and many other big names.\n\nThe Cube Guys' have managed to chart every single on of their releases and have been selected and licensed by the most important international record companies.

Their introduction to folk music came later, when a close friend--who died young due to a tragic misdiagnosis--entrusted to them her collection of 1960s folk albums and her guitar (which has since been featured on all of their albums). Inspired by the grit and true-to-life experiences she heard in these traditional ballads, Hall was inspired to write the lyrics that later became her first songs, aided by Anderson\u2019s flair for musical arrangement. Soon afterwards, Hall released two solo albums, Sings! (1999) and Sunday Afternoon (2002), both produced by Anderson. In the winter of 2003, the duo quit their boring desk jobs, moved to the green hills of Vermont, and decided to pursue a full-time career as touring musicians.\n\n\n\nThey released their first CD, Hungrytown, in 2008; Any Forgotten Thing in 2011; and Further West in 2015.

No Depression christened her \u201cEqual parts June Carter Cash, Nick Cave and Murder By Death.\u201d From Under the Basement magazine summed her up by saying, \u201cImagine Bill Monroe and Sid Vicious having kids together.\u201d Common Folk Music went a step further, suggesting a sound equivalent to \u201cthe glint of a switchblade held to your throat.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while Emch chose to dub her latest project the Secret Emchy Society, the truth is she\u2019s always remained clear and concise when it comes to her convictions. A singer, songwriter, author, poet, radio host and outspoken advocate for causes affecting the LGBTQ community, she\u2019s pursued both cause and craft since first opting to become a performer from the time she was a child, while singing classic cabaret songs with her mother. At age 14, she picked up her first guitar and learned to play via the Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen songbooks. Since then, her career has blossomed, thanks to time with her bands Vagabondage, Feral, Sinners Tonic, and her bluegrass band, convincingly titled Rhubarb Whiskey, whose offshoot Oakland Wine Drinkers Union, Local 88 helped broaden her musical palette. At the same time, she found herself sharing stages with other Bay Area favorites, including T Sisters, 5 Cent Coffee, Mark Growden, Pony Hunt, Foxtail Brigade, and more.\n\nAfter a succession of albums, EPs and guest appearances with such standout artists as Juno-nominated singer Carolyn Mark, the band Unwoman, and longtime collaborator Sean Malroy, Emch expanded her ambitions and founded the aforementioned Secret Emchy Society, a loose collective that features a revolving group of like-minded musicians who hop on her bandwagon during various stops along the tour. The cast currently includes Emch on vocals, guitar and accordion, Hans Winold on bass, Dillie Dauley on viola, and Eric \u201cScratch\u201d Ingerson on drums.\n\nDespite the contributions of her talented co-conspirators, the band\u2019s first offering, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville qualifies as Emch\u2019s official solo debut after years of playing and songwriting with others. She describes it as \u201can album of hard earned heartbreakers and foot stompers about good friends and hard times.\" Emch wrote all the material either in whole or with occasional input from her collaborators, making for a series of songs that rejoice and reflect, ruminate and reminisce about times both good and bad, and especially the importance of being true to one\u2019s own ideas and identity. The music celebrates a variety of vintage styles, from rowdy barn-burners and old time honky tonk, to tears-in- your beer ballads, zydeco rave-ups, and brassy collusions of country and cabaret, aiming to strike its appeal with both the mainstream and the marginalized.\n\nAs her collaborator Carolyn Mark said of Emch\u2019s music \u201cIt pairs well with whisky and hitting the streets.\u201d\n\nBased on initial impressions, the critics seem to agree. \u201cFrom the very first listen I loved this album, after which I loved it more and more with every listen...\" said Mike Morrison of AmericanRootsUK.com. \"The songs on The Stars Fall Shooting are pretty and gritty, sexy and sad,\u201d writes Jessie Lynn McMains aka Rust Belt Jessie, Racine, Wisconsin\u2019s Poet Laureate. \u201cThe music is a mix of everything from honky tonk to alt-country, to jazz and zydeco and punk, and it slides into your ears like a good blend of rye whiskies sliding down your throat. Sweet and warm, with just enough of a burn.\"\n\nNone of this ought to come as any surprise considering that Emch\u2019s literary endeavors have closely paralleled her musical output. A well recognized writer and poet, she has published five chapbooks, founded / hosted / curated the Queer Open Mic for five years, and featured at dozens of spoken word showcases including Sister Spit, the Radar Reading series, K'vetch, Writers With Drinks, as well as co-hosted a queer radio show with Lynn Breedlove. She has been interviewed on PirateCat Radio, FCC Free Radio, Revelator Radio, OutsiderWriters.com, ReadThisMagazine.co.uk, Drinks with Tony (Radio Valencia) and on NPR for her writing, her music, and, she claims, \u201cher propensity for being in car accidents that are not her fault.\u201d Notably too, she has also been featured in the Accordion Babes Calendar and was notoriously Francis Bean Cobain\u2019s favorite \u2018babe\u2019 of that year.\n\nNevertheless, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was borne from less than assuring circumstances. After burning out from years of day-job overtime, the loss of friends and family members and watching her own health decline due to the stress, Emch found herself sitting in a haunted bar in New Orleans, her spiritual second home. There she met a \u201cgrizzled and gorgeous\u201d old woman who told her, \u201cCome on honey, this is New Orleans. You gotta shake your ass!\u201d The musician took the women\u2019s admonition as a sign \u2013 it was time to get down to her real work as a musical artist.\n\nThe Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was recorded at Lucky Mouse Studios in Victoria, British Columbia, with the help of vocalist/guitarist/producer Tolan McNeil and singer/pianist Carolyn Mark who trades vocals with Emch on \u201cHad Enough.\u201d \u201cShe was the first person to put me solo on a stage with a guitar in my hands,\u201d Emch recalls. In fact, it was Mark\u2019s decision to enlist Emch as her opening act for a show at the Epicurean Connection in Sonoma, California that launched the Secret Emchy Society\u2019s first official performance. Mark also recruited members of her own band, bassist Dennis Siemens and drummer/guitarist Joel Fernandes, to assist on Secret Emchy Society\u2019s debut. Other contributors include Grayson Walker on piano and accordion, back-up vocalist J. McLaughlan and Olivier Clements on brass.\n\n\u201cI flew from Oakland to Victoria and spent four days teaching the band the songs, laying down the core tracks, and making sure we were all on the same page,\u201d Emch recalls. \u201cWhat we came up with was an impressive array of harmonies, accordion, piano, upright bass, horns, drums, a whole passel of guitars, and a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEmch, who cites Hank Williams, Hazel Dickens, Shovels & Rope, Johnny Paycheck, Charles Mingus, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Bob Wills, and the Corn Sisters as key influences, went all out when it came to gathering material for the album. \u201cThere are scraps and orphans of songs that made it onto this record that were years and years old,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are songs on this record that were less than two weeks old when they were recorded. All I know is that I threw every bit of myself into it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder then that the results are both highly personal and wholly contagious.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to offer the world is music, stories, and finding ways that I can throw the most powerful parts of myself into a few muddled chords and some danger,\u201d Emch insists.\n\nGiven those efforts, it\u2019s also clear that she\u2019s succeeded.\n\nFor more information and track by track descriptions, go to http://www.emchy.com", "otherInfo": "Dot's Sunday Hoedown Featuring Thee Old Country, Secret Emchy Society, Beckylin & Her Druthers and a special SECRET GUEST who happens to be one of the founding members of The Corn Sisters!\n\nMonthly Sunday Hoedown with the best country, americana, rockabilly, alt-rock bands in the bay.

Now \u201cSpyboy\u201d ups the ante by digging deeper into the sound of New Orleans culture and giving it a modern twist. The disc\u2019s largely original material takes advantage of the band\u2019s new horn section to highlight the musicians\u2019 personal ties to the street music of their hometown. \u201cWe wanted to take the roots of what we love about New Orleans brass band music and Mardi Gras Indian music and then voice it in our own way,\u201d says the group\u2019s drummer and founder, Joe Gelini.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition began when African-American men first marched in Native American dress through the streets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras day. The tradition, which includes a host of songs shared among the various tribes, has been kept alive for over a century and today is as vital as ever. Mardi Gras Indians have influenced the biggest names in New Orleans music: The Meters, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, the Neville Brothers, Trombone Shorty and others. The most prominent Mardi Gras Indian today is Monk Boudreaux, the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe, and his grandson J\u2019Wan Boudreaux (who holds the position of Spyboy in the tribe) is stepping up with Cha Wa to propel their culture forward.\n\nJ\u2019Wan joined the group when he was still in high school. At the time, Gelini, then a recent Berklee School of Music grad, had been playing drums for Boudreaux\u2019s grandfather, having learned the traditional Mardi Gras Indian beats from original Wild Magnolias bass drummer Norwood \u201cGeechie\u201d Johnson at Sunday night Indian practices in Uptown New Orleans. As the band evolved, J\u2019Wan emerged as the front man. On \u201cSpyboy,\u201d Boudreaux\u2019s vocals (with support from Thaddeus \u201cPeanut\u201d Ramsey\u2019s smooth-voiced Indian style), the booming, funked-up sound of the band\u2019s new four-part horn section, and Gelini\u2019s mix of second line grooves and soulful Indian rhythms have all combined to kindle a new fire in Cha Wa\u2019s ever-developing sound.\n\nAlthough \u201ccha wa\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re comin\u2019 for ya\u201d in Indian vernacular, Boudreaux says the album \u201cSpyboy\u201d is \u201cCha Wa all around\u201d for a different reason. With songwriting contributions to \u201cSpyboy\u201d from band members Joe Maize, Thaddeus \u2018Peanut\u2019 Ramsey, Ari Teitel and Clifton \u2018Spug\u2019 Smith, along with J\u2019Wan and Gelini, Cha Wa ignites an entire new generation with contemporary anthems set ablaze by its high-flying ensemble. Says Boudreaux, \u201cEveryone put their minds together to make this music. Everyone had input on at least one song. And the whole band has a different type of connection these days. Everybody\u2019s bonded now. Everybody\u2019s just having fun\u201d.\n\n\nThe track \u201cGet On Out the Way\u201d -- with its loose, \u201870s funk rhythm, tight horn parts and deep, bouncing sousaphone -- brings that celebratory vibe to life by spiking a traditional Indian phrase with a fast-moving brass band twist.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more serious, social message at work in Cha Wa\u2019s music. Gelini and Monk wrote \u201cVisible Means Of Support\u201d about Monk\u2019s experience with the \u201850s-era Jim Crow vagrancy law used primarily to arrest African-American men. On the J\u2019Wan-penned, big beat-centric \u201cChapters,\u201d the singer tackles more contemporary issues, in this case, the internal struggles he faced while being raised by a single mom.\n\nThe mellow, piano and vocals-only \u201cJ\u2019Wan\u2019s story\u201d sees him taking a different approach to bridging the gap between beauty and harsh reality in New Orleans when he explains, spoken word-style, the basics about how and why Mardi Gras Indian culture developed.\n\n\u201cWe dress up in the Indian suits to pay homage to the Native American Indians, because around the time of slavery, they were the first ones to take us in,\u201d he says, elaborating on the song. \u201cEverything on our suits is handmade -- the beads, the patterns, we sew together pieces of fabric and make the panels, we make the boots -- everything.\u201d\n\nNot that you need a firm understanding of Indian or brass band culture to feel the dance-ready vibrations of Cha Wa\u2019s new music. \u201cIt\u2019s dance music so I think people are attracted to it. Even if people have no idea what the history is, it\u2019s automatically infectious,\u201d Gelini explains. \u201cJ\u2019wan\u2019s the next generation,\u201d the drummer adds. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping this flame lit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "California", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6373836.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Pop Punk", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Back by popular demand , the acclaimed international artist Dadju is coming back to the US to debut the P.O.A tour 2020."}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Sawyer (US)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9463341.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Pop, Pop, Dream Pop, Shoegaze", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Sawyer is a Nashville based duo comprised of Kel Taylor and Emma Harvey that can be described in no other way than \u201cIndie Sparkle Pop.\u201d With comparisons to Lucy Rose, COIN, and HAIM they have built a resonance that can\u2019t be forgotten.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 6:30 PM SHOW: 7 PM\nPremier Seating + Meet and Greet Available"}, {"Address": "224 Vintage Wy, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "Glen Phillips", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9626073.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.55345, 38.088411], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, American Pop, Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Hopmonk Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "Glen Phillips has always been a courageous and inviting songwriter. During his years as lead singer of Toad the Wet Sprocket, the band\u2019s elegant folk/pop sound and his honest, introspective lyrics helped them forge a close bond with their fans. Since starting his solo career, Phillips has pared his music down to its emotional core, concentrating on the simple truths of love and relationships, with a profound spiritual understanding.\nSwallowed by the New takes on life\u2019s difficult transitions and delivers some of the Phillips' most vulnerable songs. \u201cI made this album during the dissolution of a 23 year marriage, Phillips says. \u201cA major chapter of my life was coming to a close, and I discovered early on that I had to work hard to get through the transition with compassion and clarity. These songs were a big part of that process.\u201d\n\nThe album was recorded in May of 2015 with producer/bass player Paul Bryan (Aimee Mann, Lucinda Williams), Jay Bellerose (drums), Chris Bruce (guitar), Jebin Bruni (keys) and Ruby Amanfu (vocals). The sparse arrangements are centered on Phillips\u2019 vocals and acoustic guitar.\n\nShimmering electric guitar accents drift through a curtain of sighing strings on Go, a ballad that bids a poignant farewell to a lover at the end of a relationship.\n\n\u201cAnd though I want you close / This light can only glow / To\nwarn you far away from shore / Saying I love you, now go,\u201d\nLeaving Oldtown has the feel of a classic pop ballad, with a string section and piano supporting a poignant vocal, as Phillips describes a man, \u201chollow as a sparrow bone,\u201d packing up his belongings as winter approaches.\n\nThe Easy Ones focuses on the importance of staying present when it\u2019s not easy or simple, but necessary. Joined in harmony with his 13-year daughter, Phillips says: \u201cYou can\u2019t just love the easy ones / You\u2019ve got to let them in / When you\u2019d rather just run.\u201d\n\nAmnesty is a gentle rocker, with twang-heavy guitars, a funky back beat and elegant string accents, it chronicles a\nlong journey of searching for understanding and safe harbor.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to catch some kind of spark / In every face I see / And offer amnesty.\u201d\n\nHeld Up suggests a gospel tune being chanted by a chain gang. The stomping drumbeat and jubilant handclaps support a vocal that faces the scales of judgment; in balance between self-recrimination and salvation. \u201cBrother you ain\u2019t so broken / Sister you ain\u2019t so small / Everybody goes together / Or nobody goes at all.\u201d\n\nThe folk hymn Grief and Praise was inspired by writer Martin Prechtel who maintains that \u201cgrief is praising those things we love and have lost, and praise is grieving those things we love and will lose\u201d. It sums up the philosophy of the record in no uncertain terms: \u201cFor all that you love will be taken some day / By the angel of death or the servants of change / In a floodwater tide without rancor or rage / So sing loud while you're able / In grief and in praise\u201d\n\nSwallowed by the New is full of the inviting melodies that\nhave always marked Phillips\u2019 work, while his singing reaches a new degree of intimacy and immediacy. The arrangements hint at country, soul, folk, rock and classic pop, without ever sounding derivative. The emotions may be raw, but they are guided by Phillips\u2019 steady vocals towards healing and renewal.\n\nPhillips started Toad the Wet Sprocket in 1986, when he was still in high school. He was as surprised as anyone when their low-key folk rock landed them on the pop charts. When the band members decided to go their separate ways, Phillips began a solo career with Abulum followed by Winter Pays for Summer, Mr. Lemons and Secrets of the New Explorers. Always open to new projects and unlikely collaborations, he\u2019s toured and recorded with Works Progress Administration, a band that included members of Nickel Creek, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Elvis Costello\u2019s Attractions; Mutual Admiration Society with Nickel Creek; Remote Tree Children, an experimental project with John Askew and Plover, with Neilson Hubbard and Garrison Starr.\n\nHis acoustic duo tour to support Swallowed by the New starts in October and will continue through the spring of 2017. \u201cI enjoy the spontaneity of acoustic performance, where I can take the show wherever it needs to go and follow the lead of an audience instead of following a set list. There\u2019s more talking, more stories, and more of a loose feel. The subject matter is on the serious side, but I feel like the perspective is ultimately positive. Life is about changes, no matter how we may try and pretend otherwise. This album is all about learning how to face change.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Glen Phillips (Toad the Wet Sprocket) + Chris Pureka"}, {"Address": "3343 Lakeshore Ave, Oakland, CA 94610", "Artist": "Marina Crouse Sings", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8977225.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.24387, 37.81095], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bardo Lounge & Supper Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Cha Wa", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8912086.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Mardi Gras Indian Funk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SFJazz Center", "moreBioInfo": "From the funk-laced beats and bass-heavy sousaphone blasts that kick off their album \u201cSpyboy\u201d to the gritty warmth of singer J\u2019Wan Boudreaux\u2019s voice, New Orleans brass band-meets-Mardi Gras Indian outfit Cha Wa radiates the fiery energy of the best features of the city\u2019s street culture. \u201cSpyboy\u201d was produced by Galactic\u2019s Ben Ellman and features special guests Big Chief Monk Boudreaux (The Wild Magnolias, HBO\u2019s Treme), Nigel Hall (Lettuce, Nth Power), and Danica Hart.\n\nCha Wa\u2019s debut, \u201cFunk N Feathers,\u201d explored contemporary riffs on the traditional music Boudreaux grew up singing alongside his grandfather, Big Chief Monk Boudreaux, in the Golden Eagles Mardi Gras Indian tribe. Now \u201cSpyboy\u201d ups the ante by digging deeper into the sound of New Orleans culture and giving it a modern twist. The disc\u2019s largely original material takes advantage of the band\u2019s new horn section to highlight the musicians\u2019 personal ties to the street music of their hometown. \u201cWe wanted to take the roots of what we love about New Orleans brass band music and Mardi Gras Indian music and then voice it in our own way,\u201d says the group\u2019s drummer and founder, Joe Gelini.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition began when African-American men first marched in Native American dress through the streets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras day. The tradition, which includes a host of songs shared among the various tribes, has been kept alive for over a century and today is as vital as ever. Mardi Gras Indians have influenced the biggest names in New Orleans music: The Meters, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, the Neville Brothers, Trombone Shorty and others. The most prominent Mardi Gras Indian today is Monk Boudreaux, the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe, and his grandson J\u2019Wan Boudreaux (who holds the position of Spyboy in the tribe) is stepping up with Cha Wa to propel their culture forward.\n\nJ\u2019Wan joined the group when he was still in high school. At the time, Gelini, then a recent Berklee School of Music grad, had been playing drums for Boudreaux\u2019s grandfather, having learned the traditional Mardi Gras Indian beats from original Wild Magnolias bass drummer Norwood \u201cGeechie\u201d Johnson at Sunday night Indian practices in Uptown New Orleans. As the band evolved, J\u2019Wan emerged as the front man. On \u201cSpyboy,\u201d Boudreaux\u2019s vocals (with support from Thaddeus \u201cPeanut\u201d Ramsey\u2019s smooth-voiced Indian style), the booming, funked-up sound of the band\u2019s new four-part horn section, and Gelini\u2019s mix of second line grooves and soulful Indian rhythms have all combined to kindle a new fire in Cha Wa\u2019s ever-developing sound.\n\nAlthough \u201ccha wa\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re comin\u2019 for ya\u201d in Indian vernacular, Boudreaux says the album \u201cSpyboy\u201d is \u201cCha Wa all around\u201d for a different reason. With songwriting contributions to \u201cSpyboy\u201d from band members Joe Maize, Thaddeus \u2018Peanut\u2019 Ramsey, Ari Teitel and Clifton \u2018Spug\u2019 Smith, along with J\u2019Wan and Gelini, Cha Wa ignites an entire new generation with contemporary anthems set ablaze by its high-flying ensemble. Says Boudreaux, \u201cEveryone put their minds together to make this music. Everyone had input on at least one song. And the whole band has a different type of connection these days. Everybody\u2019s bonded now. Everybody\u2019s just having fun\u201d.\n\n\nThe track \u201cGet On Out the Way\u201d -- with its loose, \u201870s funk rhythm, tight horn parts and deep, bouncing sousaphone -- brings that celebratory vibe to life by spiking a traditional Indian phrase with a fast-moving brass band twist.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more serious, social message at work in Cha Wa\u2019s music. Gelini and Monk wrote \u201cVisible Means Of Support\u201d about Monk\u2019s experience with the \u201850s-era Jim Crow vagrancy law used primarily to arrest African-American men. On the J\u2019Wan-penned, big beat-centric \u201cChapters,\u201d the singer tackles more contemporary issues, in this case, the internal struggles he faced while being raised by a single mom.\n\nThe mellow, piano and vocals-only \u201cJ\u2019Wan\u2019s story\u201d sees him taking a different approach to bridging the gap between beauty and harsh reality in New Orleans when he explains, spoken word-style, the basics about how and why Mardi Gras Indian culture developed.\n\n\u201cWe dress up in the Indian suits to pay homage to the Native American Indians, because around the time of slavery, they were the first ones to take us in,\u201d he says, elaborating on the song. \u201cEverything on our suits is handmade -- the beads, the patterns, we sew together pieces of fabric and make the panels, we make the boots -- everything.\u201d\n\nNot that you need a firm understanding of Indian or brass band culture to feel the dance-ready vibrations of Cha Wa\u2019s new music. \u201cIt\u2019s dance music so I think people are attracted to it. Even if people have no idea what the history is, it\u2019s automatically infectious,\u201d Gelini explains. \u201cJ\u2019wan\u2019s the next generation,\u201d the drummer adds. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping this flame lit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1638 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94703", "Artist": "Bob Hillman", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9742359.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.278843, 37.870516], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Americana, Folk Rock, Acoustic", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Monkey House", "moreBioInfo": "Bob Hillman, a San Francisco singer/songwriter, is well into the second act of a career that began in the late 1990s, flourished in the early 00s, survived ten years of \u201creal jobs,\u201d and resumed in 2016 with the Peter Case- produced Lost Soul.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 845 PM SHOW: 9:00 PM\nNO meet and greet available"}, {"Address": "116 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Seisiun", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.460518, 37.783375], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Plough & Stars", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Seisi\u00fan at Plough & Stars: Throwing back pints to a live soundtrack of traditional jigs and reels gives this Richmond watering hole a notably authentic Irish feel.

His upbringing at the Maxfield Home orphanage in Kingston and being albino in Jamaica were two obstacles the he overcame and went on to be (at one time) the biggest reggae artist since Bob Marley.\n\nAfter winning a talent contest at Tastee Patties in Kingston, Yellow went on to excite reggae crowds all over Jamaica and the rest of the world with his boastful and sometimes bodacious lyrics. His ability to ride rhythm and excite a crowd made Yellow an instant hit in Jamaica. He also began to work with the Ace Sound System in St. Thomas and drew big crowds at his dancehall performances. Later in his career, Yellow began to spread out and work for a number of different producers, sometimes releasing as many as five albums per year. This led to a recording contract with CBS Records. Yellowman recorded one album with them before he was diagnosed with jaw cancer and was given six months to live. This was in 1986. After surgery an extended leave of absence from the record industry, Yellowman began his comeback with the song \"Blueberry Hill\", and his career was re-launched. His first album for RAS came from producer Phillip 'Fatis' Burrell and was called \"Yellow Like Cheese\". Coincidentally this was the start of a long and fruitful relationship with RAS and Yellowman and also RAS and 'Fatis' and his exterminator production. Yellowman has always been very professional to work with and always a respectful and reliable human being. He has managed to outlive his predicted fate of death and his performances are incredibly lively as he seems to have an unlimited amount of stage energy. We can only hope for the best for Yellowman. He has continued his hard work and his devotion to his family is to be complimented.\n\nThe rudest Dancehall toaster of the 1980s, Jamaica's albino son Yellowman made as many enemies as fans with his controversial, often overtly sexist (if tongue in cheek) lyrics.

It\u2019s a record about isolation that fosters connection, a narrative of anxiety that offers reassurance, a chronicle of despair that promises hope. Inspired by the moments that come just before sleep, when silence descends and doubt and fear and desire take over, the album is an unflinchingly honest self-examination, a courageous reckoning with darkness and depression. Along with his musical partner Dan Cobb, Cullen captures the full range of those nightly emotional rollercoasters on the album\u2014the consuming guilt, the crippling loneliness, the directionless drifting\u2014bringing them to life in a seductive blend of electronic grooves, dreamy synths, and washed out guitars.\n\nWhile the record finds the British duo pushing their songwriting to bold new heights, it also manages to preserve their unassumingly homespun roots. Teaming with producer Gianluca Buccellati (Tei Shei, Colouring), Cullen and Cobb recorded most of the collection in their respective bedrooms before adding finishing touches at London\u2019s Hackney Road Studios. The album opens with the ominous \u201cHandmade Ego,\u201d a menacing, mesmerizing track that walks a tightrope between sexual desire and self-loathing as Cullen\u2019s breathy, layered vocals build from a whisper to a snarl. On the hypnotic \u201cBottled Up,\u201d Cullen explores the emotional toll of self-isolation, while the swirling \u201cNo Devotion\u201d weighs the costs of a loveless relationship, and the epic title track channels the whirlwind of a racing mind as it spirals deeper and deeper into the reverberating darkness. As heavy as the subject matter can be, the songs often strike a tone of defiant optimism, transforming regret and pain into growth and strength, secure in the knowledge that, no matter how it may feel some nights, none of us are truly alone in this world.\n\nSince its inception, Tender has specialized in walking that artful line between the personal and the universal.

This fourteen track album follows a recent run of hugely acclaimed albums (Roll With The Punches, Versatile and You\u2019re Driving Me Crazy), each of which has delved deep into the musical styles that have continued to inspire Van throughout his life \u2013 vocal jazz and R&B. Here, Van takes on a series of unarguable classics by the likes of John Lee Hooker, Sam Cooke and Solomon Burke (among others) and makes them unmistakably his own. Alongside these reinterpretations, The Prophet Speaks features six phenomenal new Van Morrison compositions.\n\nVan Morrison says of The Prophet Speaks: \u201cIt was important for me to get back to recording new music as well as doing some of the blues material that has inspired me from the beginning. Writing songs and making music is what I do, and working with great musicians makes it all the more enjoyable.\u201d\n\nThe Prophet Speaks again finds Van working with the incredible multi-instrumentalist Joey DeFrancesco (the artist co-credited on You\u2019re Driving Me Crazy) and his band (including Dan Wilson on guitar, Michael Ode on drums and Troy Roberts on tenor saxophone).\n\nThe title track from The Prophet Speaks is available now as an instant grat \u2013 listen here.

No Depression christened her \u201cEqual parts June Carter Cash, Nick Cave and Murder By Death.\u201d From Under the Basement magazine summed her up by saying, \u201cImagine Bill Monroe and Sid Vicious having kids together.\u201d Common Folk Music went a step further, suggesting a sound equivalent to \u201cthe glint of a switchblade held to your throat.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while Emch chose to dub her latest project the Secret Emchy Society, the truth is she\u2019s always remained clear and concise when it comes to her convictions. A singer, songwriter, author, poet, radio host and outspoken advocate for causes affecting the LGBTQ community, she\u2019s pursued both cause and craft since first opting to become a performer from the time she was a child, while singing classic cabaret songs with her mother. At age 14, she picked up her first guitar and learned to play via the Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen songbooks. Since then, her career has blossomed, thanks to time with her bands Vagabondage, Feral, Sinners Tonic, and her bluegrass band, convincingly titled Rhubarb Whiskey, whose offshoot Oakland Wine Drinkers Union, Local 88 helped broaden her musical palette. At the same time, she found herself sharing stages with other Bay Area favorites, including T Sisters, 5 Cent Coffee, Mark Growden, Pony Hunt, Foxtail Brigade, and more.\n\nAfter a succession of albums, EPs and guest appearances with such standout artists as Juno-nominated singer Carolyn Mark, the band Unwoman, and longtime collaborator Sean Malroy, Emch expanded her ambitions and founded the aforementioned Secret Emchy Society, a loose collective that features a revolving group of like-minded musicians who hop on her bandwagon during various stops along the tour. The cast currently includes Emch on vocals, guitar and accordion, Hans Winold on bass, Dillie Dauley on viola, and Eric \u201cScratch\u201d Ingerson on drums.\n\nDespite the contributions of her talented co-conspirators, the band\u2019s first offering, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville qualifies as Emch\u2019s official solo debut after years of playing and songwriting with others. She describes it as \u201can album of hard earned heartbreakers and foot stompers about good friends and hard times.\" Emch wrote all the material either in whole or with occasional input from her collaborators, making for a series of songs that rejoice and reflect, ruminate and reminisce about times both good and bad, and especially the importance of being true to one\u2019s own ideas and identity. The music celebrates a variety of vintage styles, from rowdy barn-burners and old time honky tonk, to tears-in- your beer ballads, zydeco rave-ups, and brassy collusions of country and cabaret, aiming to strike its appeal with both the mainstream and the marginalized.\n\nAs her collaborator Carolyn Mark said of Emch\u2019s music \u201cIt pairs well with whisky and hitting the streets.\u201d\n\nBased on initial impressions, the critics seem to agree. \u201cFrom the very first listen I loved this album, after which I loved it more and more with every listen...\" said Mike Morrison of AmericanRootsUK.com. \"The songs on The Stars Fall Shooting are pretty and gritty, sexy and sad,\u201d writes Jessie Lynn McMains aka Rust Belt Jessie, Racine, Wisconsin\u2019s Poet Laureate. \u201cThe music is a mix of everything from honky tonk to alt-country, to jazz and zydeco and punk, and it slides into your ears like a good blend of rye whiskies sliding down your throat. Sweet and warm, with just enough of a burn.\"\n\nNone of this ought to come as any surprise considering that Emch\u2019s literary endeavors have closely paralleled her musical output. A well recognized writer and poet, she has published five chapbooks, founded / hosted / curated the Queer Open Mic for five years, and featured at dozens of spoken word showcases including Sister Spit, the Radar Reading series, K'vetch, Writers With Drinks, as well as co-hosted a queer radio show with Lynn Breedlove. She has been interviewed on PirateCat Radio, FCC Free Radio, Revelator Radio, OutsiderWriters.com, ReadThisMagazine.co.uk, Drinks with Tony (Radio Valencia) and on NPR for her writing, her music, and, she claims, \u201cher propensity for being in car accidents that are not her fault.\u201d Notably too, she has also been featured in the Accordion Babes Calendar and was notoriously Francis Bean Cobain\u2019s favorite \u2018babe\u2019 of that year.\n\nNevertheless, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was borne from less than assuring circumstances. After burning out from years of day-job overtime, the loss of friends and family members and watching her own health decline due to the stress, Emch found herself sitting in a haunted bar in New Orleans, her spiritual second home. There she met a \u201cgrizzled and gorgeous\u201d old woman who told her, \u201cCome on honey, this is New Orleans. You gotta shake your ass!\u201d The musician took the women\u2019s admonition as a sign \u2013 it was time to get down to her real work as a musical artist.\n\nThe Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was recorded at Lucky Mouse Studios in Victoria, British Columbia, with the help of vocalist/guitarist/producer Tolan McNeil and singer/pianist Carolyn Mark who trades vocals with Emch on \u201cHad Enough.\u201d \u201cShe was the first person to put me solo on a stage with a guitar in my hands,\u201d Emch recalls. In fact, it was Mark\u2019s decision to enlist Emch as her opening act for a show at the Epicurean Connection in Sonoma, California that launched the Secret Emchy Society\u2019s first official performance. Mark also recruited members of her own band, bassist Dennis Siemens and drummer/guitarist Joel Fernandes, to assist on Secret Emchy Society\u2019s debut. Other contributors include Grayson Walker on piano and accordion, back-up vocalist J. McLaughlan and Olivier Clements on brass.\n\n\u201cI flew from Oakland to Victoria and spent four days teaching the band the songs, laying down the core tracks, and making sure we were all on the same page,\u201d Emch recalls. \u201cWhat we came up with was an impressive array of harmonies, accordion, piano, upright bass, horns, drums, a whole passel of guitars, and a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEmch, who cites Hank Williams, Hazel Dickens, Shovels & Rope, Johnny Paycheck, Charles Mingus, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Bob Wills, and the Corn Sisters as key influences, went all out when it came to gathering material for the album. \u201cThere are scraps and orphans of songs that made it onto this record that were years and years old,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are songs on this record that were less than two weeks old when they were recorded. All I know is that I threw every bit of myself into it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder then that the results are both highly personal and wholly contagious.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to offer the world is music, stories, and finding ways that I can throw the most powerful parts of myself into a few muddled chords and some danger,\u201d Emch insists.\n\nGiven those efforts, it\u2019s also clear that she\u2019s succeeded.\n\nFor more information and track by track descriptions, go to http://www.emchy.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "500 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Brendan Getzell", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.398131, 37.779293], "Date": "Mon Feb 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hotel Utah Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Open Mic with Brendan Getzell at Hotel Utah: The Old West and indie music come together at the Hotel Utah Saloon, where a small stage, an antique bar, and a diversely stocked jukebox set the scene.

Affectionately known as the \u201cIron Man of the Mask,\u201d Franc held the title of \u201cThe World\u2019s Longest-Running Phantom\u201d for more than a decade after bringing over five million theatre-goers to their feet in a 6-1/2-year run.\n\nBut that distinction only scratches the surface of an illustrious career spanning decades, including his portrayal of the opera-singing Anthony Corleone, son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton\u2019s characters in the seven-time Academy Award-nominated film Godfather III. Franc also sang the Academy Award-winning theme song \"Speak Softly Love\" for both the film and Original Motion Picture soundtrack, garnering over one million hits on YouTube. Paramount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search for the young Corleone, auditioning more than 2,000 artists over a one-year period before casting Franc in the role. He is the first and only person ever to sing Carmine Coppola\u2019s haunting Godfather theme in the film trilogy.\n\nFranc\u2019s performance of the song so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to study at Pavarotti\u2019s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously studied at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of \u201cTony\u201d in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow\u2019s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical.\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s BROADWAY: Songs from the Great White Way, and Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, along with tributes to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, including NBC\u2019s \u201cBrian Boitano\u2019s Skating Spectacular\u201d and \u201cThe 2005 Tribute to Music on Ice\u201d with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc\u2019s performance of \u201cMusic of the Night,\u201d as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening\u2019s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nIn May 2018, Franc was honored to receive a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival.

A prolific composer and prodigious six-string talent, Di Meola has amassed over 20 albums as a leader while collaborating on a dozen or so others with the likes of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia, Jean-Luc Ponty and more. And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal status among hordes of frettboard aficionados who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di Meola's writing and compositions along with the soulfulness of his guitar expressions, have won him legions of fans worldwide.\n\nA pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy and 1978's Casino, the guitar great has continued to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African music throughout his long career.\n\nDi Meola\u2019s most recent release, 2013\u2019s \"All Your Life\", was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music. So their impact was pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14 familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar. All the tracks are imbued with the guitarist\u2019s signature flamenco flourishes, intricate arpeggiating and dazzling cross-picking. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the Beatles created most of their records during their heyday, \"All Your Life\" stands as a triumph in the long and illustrious career of a bona fide guitar hero. \u201cI\u2019ve come full circle with this,\u201d says Di Meola. \u201cI started out my life loving the Beatles, and I never stopped, just like a lot of so many other guitarists from my generation. In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d\n\nDi Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar.\n\"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d\n\nA native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d\n\nFollowing a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al. After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.\n\n1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause.\n\nNow in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.\n\nVisit: http://www.aldimeola.com/#!tour/c9a0\n\nAlbum recordings can be found at:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/al-di-meola/id814570\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-di-meola-mn0000600228/discography\n\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Al+Di+Meola/+albums", "otherInfo": "This is an all ages show.
