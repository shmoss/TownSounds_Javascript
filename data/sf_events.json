Hailing from Red Bank, New Jersey, the group was founded by Dave Wyndorf (vocals and guitar), John McBain (guitar), Tom Diello (drums), and Tim Cronin (vocals and bass). The band first went under the name \"Dog of Mystery\" and later \"Airport 75\", before finally settling on \"Monster Magnet\".\n\nIn 1989, Monster Magnet released two demo cassettes; \"Forget About Life, I'm High on Dope\" and \"I'm Stoned, What Ya Gonna Do About It?\". The band's first 'official' release was a self-titled EP from Glitterhouse Records of Germany. In 1991 the band signed with Caroline Records and released their first full length album, the cult classic Spine of God, in 1991. The next release was a bizarre 4 song EP titled Tab which included, among two other marathon length songs, a 32 minute track called \"Tab...\". McBain was fired soon after, due to personality conflicts between himself and Dave Wyndorf. He was replaced by Atomic Bitchwax guitarist Ed Mundell; who holds the position to this day.\n\nThe year 1993 saw the release of the album Superjudge. While the album was released on major record label (A&M Records) and is considered a cult favorite among fans of the band's earlier work, the album did not sell very well. The follow-up, a more pop-influenced album, was Dopes to Infinity had a hit single in \"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\" but still did only slightly better than Superjudge. Wyndorf moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in order to begin working on Powertrip (1998), a breakthrough hit that earned a gold certification. Powertrip saw the band departing from its usual lo-fi, stoner rock fare, and enter into an era with more guitar and heavier drum beats. Guitarist Phil Cavaino joined the band in 1998. \"Space Lord\", the first single, was a major radio hit and the band went on tour with bands like Aerosmith, Metallica and Marilyn Manson. Their last album on A&M Records was God Says No (2000). After this release, Joe Calandra and Jon Kleiman departed the band due to internal conflicts with Wyndorf, and were replaced by Jim Baglino and Bob Pantella respectively. In 2003, Monster Magnet signed to the European label SPV, and in early 2004 released Monolithic Baby! throughout Europe. The U.S. release followed in May on SPV America. In March 2005 Phil Cavaino departed after 7 years service in a split described as amicable by Wyndorf. A followup to Monolithic Baby! was expected in March 2006 to coincide with their European Tour, along with rereleases of Spine of God and Tab, both featuring new artwork and liner notes, however the tour and album release did not go ahead. A DVD is also planned for late 2006.\n\nOn February 27, 2006 Dave Wyndorf overdosed on prescription drugs. His management released the following statement\n\n\"The battle with one\u2019s inner demons is the most personal fight any of us can undertake. The fight is at times a lonely, confusing journey. On the evening of February 27, Dave Wyndorf suffered a set back in his own fight and was hospitalized due to a drug overdose. His full recovery is expected. We ask that all those he has encountered over the years or simply affected by his music to take a moment to think good thoughts of and for him. With the grace of God and those who love him we are all confident that Dave will rebound from this set back and continue to play and make great rock and roll.\"\n\nMonster Magnet's style and material are heavily influenced by 1970s-era space rock bands such as Hawkwind and Captain Beyond. In addition to arranging covers such as Hawkwind's \"Brainstorm\" (Doremi Fasol Latido, 1972), Wyndorf sometimes incorporates elements of space rock staples into his own songs. For instance, the Dopes to Infinity title track borrows some of its lyrics from \"Lord of Light\" (ibid.), and Superjudge's \"Twin Earth\" is a reinterpretation of Captain Beyond's \"Mesmerization Eclipse\" (Captain Beyond, 1972). Monster Magnet's live shows occasionally feature Stacia-esque nude dancers, a fact which has landed them in trouble with the law in some American cities.", "otherInfo": "Monster Magnet - Powertrip: A Celebration"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Clark Beckham ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8649256.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463777, 37.783225], "Date": "Tue Apr 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-07", "Genre": "Blues, Soul, R&b, Pop, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Neck Of the Woods", "moreBioInfo": "My parents are both incredibly musically talented.

Beth & RW\u2019s love of the classic blues vibe pays off and yet, these songs could easily be covered by well-known singers in many roots music idioms.\nNestled alongside are songs by their mid-20th century heroes Jimmy Reed (lead track, \u201cThere\u2019ll Be a Day\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t That Loving You Baby\u201d), Memphis Minnie (\u201cLookin\u2019 the World Over\u201d), Big Bill Broonzy (\u201cLonesome Road Blues\u201d), jump blues brother-sister act, Buddy & Ella Johnson (\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Stop It\u201d) and Memphis Slim (\u201cMother Earth.\u201d)\nRed\u2019s Blues has a finger-poppin\u2019 attitude\u2014straight outta the afore-mentioned golden years when blues, R&B and swing all meshed together and dance floors every night were filled with snake hips and slow drags. Beth, with her sensual, southern voice and classy behind-the-beat phrasing is more a Julie London or Bobbie Gentry-styled singer: smoky with languid, sexy sophistication. She can swing too, just check out the big fun on \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Ya Stop It.\u201d This rich nightclub feel is missed on too many modern singers. The yearning confidentiality, the wise heart that Beth brings to her true-life stories reveal tales of youth seen through grown up reflection.\nRW, who has not lost his hometown Rome, Georgia accent has this quality also. Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is bringing our unique blues and original Americana music to the Brewster\u2019s patio.

It is from this notion that this fresh-on-the-scene trio from Oakland, CA sets out to connect with their listeners, creating a mentally-stimulating, emotionally-resonate, highly-danceable, and distinctly-transformative experience where everyone feels just a little more magical.\n\nMITO assembled in early 2017, consisting of three in-demand Bay Area veterans - drummer and bandleader Ezra Lipp (Phil Lesh & Friends, Sean Hayes), bass player Steve Adams (ALO, Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers) and guitar wizard Roger Riedlbauer (Jolie Holland, Mercury Falls). Over the course of just a year, the trio has honed in on a contagious chemistry that beams with personality and is incredibly engaging to watch. It may be difficult to pin the band down to a specific genre, however, traces can be detected. Be it the rhythmic sophistication of jazz and West African music, the unrestrained spirit of rock n\u2019 roll, the compositional approach of western classical music, or the improvisatory intensity of North Indian ragas, the magic of the band ultimately lies in the skilled fusing of all of the above (and beyond) to create a sound fresh and unique all its own.\n\nIn the fall of their break-out year, while building a buzz on stages around the Bay Area and garnering their first set of loyal fans, Ezra, Steve and Roger crowd-funded nearly $20k to put toward the making of their first full-length album. Recorded at the legendary Tiny Telephone Studios, the debut captures the band\u2019s first batch of live-tested material, and is augmented by a few of their close musical friends as well as other fun studio surprises.

In her final year of college, songs began pouring through her, and it was only through the constant urging of those around her that she began to slowly share her music. Propelled by the songs themselves, Ayla\u2019s journey of meeting those fears and singing through them has propelled her into the powerful performer she is today, touching an ever-widening global audience with the inspiring magic of her songs.\n\nA child schooled at home in the hills of Sonoma County, Ayla was raised on Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, opera, classical music, traditional celtic songs, and ABBA -- influences which have deeply shaped her music. Touching on both the timeless and modern, she always rides the line between genres, so that her songwriting and sound ultimately cannot be compared to anyone else.\n\nDancing her own songs on stage as she sings them, her movement and presence gives the audience a permission to be wild, real, vulnerable, and alive. Every performance Ayla gives is its own inspired journey; an enchanting and poignant experience that holds you by the heart and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\nAyla is releasing her 6th album in the spring of 2019 via Jumpsuit Records.

With a nationwide tour supporting the album release, a full summer of notable festival appearances, and her second European tour on the horizon, Ayla's music is reverberating from a west-coast transformational niche into larger global audiences, to inspire and uplift the hearts of humanity. Her music has also recently seen rapid and increasing growth throughout Europe, as well as Canada, Australia, and dozens of other countries.\n\nTo date, Ayla has released 5 solo albums, 2 Wildlight albums (the collaboration project of Ayla and David Sugalski, aka The Polish Ambassador), and 3 collaboration albums.\n\n\u201cA poet, musician, visionary and mystic, Ayla Nereo is an otherworldly artist who shares the fruits of her soul.\u201d ~ The Huffington Post\n\n\u201c[Ayla\u2019s] relationship with the earth is imprinted in her music \u2026 thickly layered tracks where expansive and intriguing instrumentals serve as an intricate backdrop for her delicate and soft-spoken vocals.\u201d ~ Billboard\n\n\u201cI am here to receive songs that help us remember our origins, our incredible human potential, and our right relationship with all Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are born of dust and silence.

He began playing trumpet around age 11 after hearing Cheatham play in New York City, and by his teens was studying music at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville, Florida. From 2003 to 2007, Croker attended the music conservatory at Oberlin College. While at Oberlin, he was mentored by legendary trumpeter and educator Donald Byrd.

Released in 2014 on OKeh/Sony Masterworks Records, the Echo Award nominated album found him branching out stylistically, weaving elements of funk, Latin jazz, and hip-hop into his sound. In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d.

Race\u2019s accomplishments include co-founder of the Kink Aware Professionals referral service; leader of The DSM Project that began to change how psychotherapy professionals view kink; author of the bestselling Learning The Ropes: A Basic Guide to Safe and Fun BDSM Lovemaking; founder of Daedalus Publishing Company, the first company dedicated to publishing nonfiction leather/SM/fetish books; prolific writer; former sex advice columnist; former producer and host of the first kink internet talk show Bound To Talk; past Board member of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, Community-Academic Consortium for Research on Alternative Sexualities, NLA International and Avatar Club Los Angeles; co-founder of NLA Los Angeles; and member of Chicago Hellfire Club, The 15 Association, and Society of Janus.

He\u2019s a frequent contributor, writing custom songs for the award-winning, San Francisco based, Bawdy Storytelling.

His polite vulgarity may not be for the very young and impressionable or the very old and conservative but he won\u2019t tell you how to raise your kids or upset your grandparents.\n\nHe can be seen and heckled every Monday night at his Risqu\u00e9 residency at Scopo Divino in San Francisco. For well over two years straight, he\u2019s put on a unique and interactive show where he plays original music and cover songs suggested by those in attendance who haven\u2019t already left in disgust.\n\nBergey's music can be heard on the RISK! and Bawdy Storytelling podcasts. He has performed at The Independent, Sweetwater, Great American Music Hall, Jewish Community Center in SF, John Steinbeck Association, Special Olympics in Long Beach, Punchline SF, and SF Sketchfest.\n\nHis newest EP titled \u2018Always Up (To Go Down)\u2019 was originally written for Bawdy Storytelling and is flanked by a few of his \u2018inter-lewds\u2019, now fleshed out with piano, bass, and pedal steel.

We all know that as soon as rock n roll starts to resemble going to the office, there\nare no winners \u2013 everybody's screwed. As the German trio KADAVAR \u2013 arguably the hardest working band in European rock \u2013 stand on the brink of releasing their fourth full length album, they look back at a seven year long career of doing things the other way around.\nRather than this being the time to start talking about how music is just another way of paying the bills, they could not be more in tune with the main reason anybody starts a band in the first place \u2013 liberation.\n\u201cWe used to put ourselves under a lot of pressure,\u201d says guitarist and vocalist Christoph \u2018Lupus\u2019 Lindemann. \u201cWe didn't want to be just another rock band, we wanted to be the best.\nNow we are free from the idea that we need to hit the charts or fill big halls to become happy. To get to that point everyone involved needs mental maturity, and this satisfies me more than any full arena.\u201d\nNot that they are strangers to neither chart positions nor sold out venues. After being formed in the German capital city back in 2010, the word of KADAVAR playing in a different league from their retro rock-labelled peers quickly spread worldwide, resulting not only in\naudiences growing past the 1000 mark on their many tours, but also in chart positions for their third and latest album \u00bbBerlin\u00ab \u2013 entering on position 18 in Germany and 21 in the US Heatseekers charts. Highly regarded as one of the most explosive live experiences on\ncontemporary rock scene, their secret seems to be boiled down and brewed from three ingredients: an accessible yet personalized brand of classic rock; a no-frills approach to everything they do (\u201dminimal arrangement, maximum effect\u201d); and that undeniable German\ntenacity, yet again.\n\u201cEven in the early years there was somehow an implication that unless we gave it 120 per cent, nobody would ever recognise any of it,\u201d says drummer Christoph \u2018Tiger\u2019 Bartelt. \u201cThat was one half. The other half was juveline over-confidence!\u201d Him and Lupus both grew up working class, the latter in an over-achieving family of athletes,\nwhich fueled his competitive side (\u201din our family, the second best was the first loser\u201d). Both studied sound engineering after high school, and met in the beer-drenched Berlin underground at night time, as you do. Inspiration struck when the new wave of retro rock flooded the scene in the mid-00s, and together they built KADAVAR on the foundation of a\nvintage sound with classic song structure \u2013 a conscious step away from the increasingly heavier stoner bands of the time (the name itself was inspired by the American underground heroes DANAVA). \u201cIf someone does a seven minute jam on one riff and sells it as something\ncool I think he is just too stupid to write a good song!\u201d Lupus says. \u201cWe wanted to sound more like a heavy garage band. We still do, maybe now more than ever.\u201d\nPersonality-wise, they couldn't be more different. Lupus is social and opinionated. An emotional straight-shooter, or \u201dEast German\u201d - as he himself sums it up. Where he wears his heart on his sleeve, Tiger on the other hand keeps his neatly tucked inside, only to be\nexposed to the outside world on stage. Where Lupus speaks, Tiger thinks.\n\u201cIt's not by chance that he calls himself Lupus - \u201dwolf\u201d,\u201d the drummer says. \u201cHe has killer instinct and he is a loyal warrior. He is impulsive and it somehow feels like he enjoys being uncomfortable. Getting on the same page with him requires a lot of friction and a strong\nstance. It sounds rough, but I really like it.\u201c\n\u201cTiger takes the time it needs to really understand a situation and make a decision based on\nit. I trust him and rely on him and without him the band would be dead,\u201d Lupus says. In between them two balances Simon \u2018Dragon\u2019 Bouteloup, the bassist who replaced the original member Phillip \u2018Mammut\u2019 Lippitz. There is nothing German about this Parisian bohemian. Simon spent his late teenage years drifting around Europe intuitively \u2013 just like\nhis style of playing \u2013 later ending up with the infamous French psychonauts in AQUA NEBULA OSCILLATOR. He moved to Berlin in 2012 to play with THE OATH, and joined KADAVAR two years later.\n\u201cSimon is a really great, beloved person who changed the band so much. He has a totally different background music-wise, and also is attitude to life. If you don't give it time and learn\nhow to slow down and listen to him, you will never find out who he is. But if you do a whole new world opens up,\u201d Lupus says. \u201cHis dedication to music is remarkable,\u201d Tiger adds. \u201cThat's something I've always adored about him.\u201d\nTogether the trio form a uniqe symbiose, challenging each other to fill the sonic space between them when the curtain goes up \u2013 and to grow even closer after it's gone down.\n\u201cBeing only three on stage does not give you much margin of error, so each and every one of us need to kick ass every night. But at least it gives everyone enough space to express himself, sonically and physically on stage,\u201d Simon says.\nIn the beginning of 2017 the band prepared to start a new album cycle by literally rolling up their sleeves and building a brand new recording studio from scratch. Over 100 square\nmetres inside an industrial complex in the area of Neuk\u00f6lln in Berlin is now their creative haven and workplace alike, and this is where the follow-up to \u00bbBerlin\u00ab has started to take form.\n\u201cWe have been giving it quite a lot of thought, how we want to continue after the last album,\u201d says Tiger. \u201cMaybe I try not to only be a musician, but to think, write and play like an artist. It sounds corny, but I mean it in the way a brick layer differs from an architecht. Not to\nonly lay brick by brick, but create a nice vision of a house with different rooms.\u201d Intentionally or not, the act of manual labor \u2013 like building a house in arrival of a new baby \u2013 gives a poetic layer to the album process. \u201cIt is a big challenge,\u201d Simon says. \u201cBut also a positive\nperiod where we are able to question everything we've already established in order to move forward as a band. We would not respect ourselves and our followers by putting out just\nanother KADAVAR album. It needs to be different and hopefully better!\u201c\nThey might have eased up on the competitive attitude, but don't believe for a second the\nhunger is gone.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Amendola vs. Blades! The duo is back @ The Ivy Room!\nYes indeed!

Blades\n\n\u201cThe breadth of what we do is so wide we don't have to think about it,\u201d says longtime Bay Area drummer Scott Amendola, when talking about fellow local organist Wil Blades--the other half of the dynamic music duo known as Amendola vs. Blades. \u201cThe cool thing is we can play swingin\u2019 old school jazz, funk and rock, African music, to playing free.\u201d Such dynamic range would prove challenging for any band, let alone one consisting merely of eight limbs, two analog keyboards and a drum kit. But it\u2019s a challenge the two friends have eagerly met gig after gig since their auspicious first show together, a performance of Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite\u201d as an organ and drums arrangement, ten years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s all about keeping it fresh,\u201dadds Amendola. \u201cAnd keeping the audience engaged.\u201d And keeping audiences sonically freshened and engaged throughout their ever-evolving decade-long stint hasn\u2019t been a problem for this uncanny duo, who\u2019ve imprinted plenty of nondescript juke joints: the High Sierra Music Festival, SF Jazz, and the iconic Fillmore, alike with their slithery sound, enough to make stalwart critics like the SF Chronicle\u2019s Joel Selvin squawk: \"As for Wil Blades and Scott Amendola, these two Young Turks of the San Francisco jazz scene are bringing the organ-drum duo into the 21st century.\" And during this century, if you wanted to experience Amendola vs. Blades, you\u2019d have to be one of the many thousands who\u2019ve steadily showed up at one of their live duo adventures. Sure, you may have seen and/or heard these two in-demand session players as bandleaders in their own right, or as distinguished sidemen with the likes of Nels Cline, Charlie Hunter, John Zorn, Mike Patton, John Scofield, Idris Muhammad, Bernard Purdie, or Dr. Lonnie Smith. But if you wanted an album of just the two of them facing off as they do, literally on stage--you\u2019d have to wait. Until now. Finally, Scott Amendola and Wil Blades bring us their long-anticipated debut album\u2014Greatest Hits\u2014on Sazi Records. Recorded over two nights in front of an intimate audience in a downtown Oakland club in June of last year, Greatest Hits is comprised of seven originals, tunes that had initially been composed and recorded by Scott and Wil for other projects. Depending who you ask, the album title could perhaps be construed as a mini-sampler of what\u2019s to come, or perhaps a facetious statement of what was. The germ for the album took shape nearly two years ago. Adds Scott, \u201cWe always talked about it, but our schedules never lined up due to both of us being heavily on the road. As other projects ended, we actually had time to take it seriously.\u201dBlades adds, \u201cThe thing about live recording was double-fold. For us playing as a duo is very loose and fun, so the best way to capture that was live--the vibe of a studio can make you feel restrained under pressure. A loose gig is a better representation of how we play our stuff, which is improvising.\u201dOn Greatest Hits, such improvisation creatively steers the duo through a scenic tour of music genres, as each artist pushes and pull the other toward unanticipated discovery, all the while powered by the heavy grooves laid down by Blades\u2019 mastery of the Hammond organ, and Hohner Clavinet, and anchored by Amendola\u2019s rhythmic drum array. \u201cMost organ players are piano players first,\n\norgan players second. But Wil\u2019s the opposite. His relationship to the organ is deeper than anyone I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d, say Amendola. In addition to Hammond organ, (and requisite Leslie speaker), Blades doubles his keyboard arsenal with the distinct sound of a Clavinet, one he spent a summer tediously restoring. \u201cIt literally has my blood, sweat and tears in it,\u201d laughs Wil. \u201cIt opens up more sonic possibilities, and just adds another color texture to the mix.\u201dThe seven tunes on Greatest Hits impresses with its own set of colors and textures. From the fast boogaloo of \u201cLima Bean,\u201d to the New Orleans 2nd line vibe of \u201c32nd St.\u201d, and \u201cSlow Zig,\u201d (a tribute to Meters legend Zigaboo Modeliste); the complex 6/8 rhythms of the Ethiopian-inspired \u201cAddis\u201d, to the afrobeat-centric homage via \u201cOladipo\u201d, to Fela\u2019s right (and left) hand man, wunderkind drummer Tony Allen; or from the soulful songs dedicated to their respective daughters in \u201cDeep Eyes\u201d, and \u201cMae Mae.\u201dIt\u2019s a range Amendola vs. Blades is uniquely suited to express. \u201cI like playing tunes,\u201d the drummer says. \u201cI like the idea of there being a structure to launch from, and being a duo means there are a lot of possibilities harmonically and rhythmically. Neither one of us knows what we are gonna do, and that is exciting both for us, and the audience.\u201d\n\nPress\n\n\"The Amendola vs Blades duo has firmly established itself as one of the liveliest acts in the Bay Area.\"\n- Jazz Observer\n\n\u201cSometimes it just ridiculous how much sonic space Scott Amendola and Wil Blades alone can fill up in a room.

It's a sound rooted in big melodies, blasts of brass, percussive punch, and old-school grooves, with songs that shine a light not only on frontwoman Alanna Quinn-Broadus' larger-than-life voice, but her songwriting chops, too.\n\nThe band formed in Nashville, where Alanna and guitarist Jared Colby relocated after cutting their teeth as working-class musicians in Boston. Once in Tennessee, they teamed up with drummer Matt Snow, and bassist Gabriel Golden, forming a core lineup that often swells to as many as ten members -- including backup vocalists and a two-piece horn section -- in concert. Together, the band looked beyond Nashville's country-filled past and, instead, took inspiration from Motown's soul, Stax's funky strut, and rock & roll's rebellion. Tattooed, brash, and unapologetically unique, they stood out in a town dominated by Americana music, charting a unique course whose highlights have since included an appearance at Bonnaroo, a string of cross-country shows supporting acts like Lee Fields and St. Paul and the Broken Bones, and an audience that celebrates the band's diversity.\n\nOn their fourth release, 2018's So Bad You Can Taste It, Alanna matches the brassy spirit of the band's previous records \u2014 including their full-length debut, Achilles \u2014 with rare vulnerability. There's still plenty of soulful stomp here, from the upbeat sweep of the record's lead single, \"I Know,\" to the funky fire of \"Giving It All Away.\" There's also a more mature, sober look at the demands thrust upon independent artists \u2014 or anyone's who's willing to chase down an uncertain horizon, no matter how rough the journey may be. With songs that examine the midpoint between desperation and drive, So Bad You Can Taste It is the band's most genuine work to date.\n\n\"There are mountains and valleys to any journey, and this record is about being in the valley,\" explains Alanna Quinn-Broadus. \"It's about the low moments. It's basically the opposite of someone's Instagram feed, because it's not a highlights reel. It's just real.\"\n\nLow moments notwithstanding, So Bad You Can Taste It marks a creative high for Alanna Royale, whose members recorded the record's six songs with producer Kelly Finnigan and engineer Mindy Watts across multiple studios. Joining them were guests like trombonist Nadav Nirenberg -- known for his work alongside artists like Wyclef Jean, Breakdown Brass, and Wu Tang -- as well as Kirk Donovan, Meggan Utech, and Alexis Saski. Working with this expanded crew, Alanna Royale carved out a song-based sound that targeted not only their audience's dancing shoes, but their heads and hearts, too. Songs like the powerful, poignant ballad \"I Used to Dream\" were reworked multiple times, resulting in a record that's nuanced, heartfelt, and unafraid to show off its own scars.\n\n\"The title, So Bad You Can Taste It, says it all,\" Alanna explains. \"This record is all about the idea of something that's in front of you, and you can see it and feel it, but it's just out of reach. That thing can be your sanity or your sobriety or your success. I sometimes think it's harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel, rather than not seeing any light at all. Once you know the possibility of light is there, you have no option but to go after it. That can be really hard and really dangerous\u2026which makes it really worthwhile to sing about.\"", "otherInfo": "We're SO excited to announce that we'll be hittin' the west coast for the first time to support our brothers in Monophonics and the release of their new record \"It's Only Us\"!

Well, that is where we are at now. From filthy, sweaty rehearsal rooms and tiny clubs and pubs NAPALM DEATH has conquered every music festival you can think of and toured through corners of the world a lot of bands would not even dare to tour while becoming famous for combining brutal music with political engagement and ethical values beyond the usual clich\u00e9 of sex, drugs & rock n roll. And, as most fans will be delighted to hear, this remarkable story is far from being over\u2026\n\nFourteen albums in (not counting the cover-platter \u201cLeaders\u2026Part 2\u201d) three decades and NAPALM DEATH remain the leaders of the grindcore / death metal world, once again showing the upstarts how it's done.

He began playing trumpet around age 11 after hearing Cheatham play in New York City, and by his teens was studying music at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville, Florida. From 2003 to 2007, Croker attended the music conservatory at Oberlin College. While at Oberlin, he was mentored by legendary trumpeter and educator Donald Byrd. Also during this time, he earned the Presser Music Foundation Award, which funded his debut album, 2006's Fundamentals. After graduating Oberlin, Croker relocated to China, where he took up residency at Shanghai's House of Blues. His 2009 album, In the Tradition, paid tribute to Cheatham.\n\nIn 2013, Croker returned to the States and began work on his third solo album, the Dee Dee Bridgewater-produced Afro Physicist. Released in 2014 on OKeh/Sony Masterworks Records, the Echo Award nominated album found him branching out stylistically, weaving elements of funk, Latin jazz, and hip-hop into his sound. In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "327 Lasuen St, Stanford, CA 94305", "Artist": "Bruce Cockburn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6288087.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.1722, 37.4215], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Rock, Folk, Classic Rock, Rock And Roll", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Bing Concert Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Bruce Cockburn Bone on Bone\nBone On Bone\n\nFew recording artists are as creative and prolific as Bruce Cockburn. Since his self-titled debut in 1970, the Canadian singer-songwriter has issued a steady stream of acclaimed albums every couple of years. But that output suddenly ran dry in 2011 following the release of Small Source of Comfort. There were good reasons for the drought. For one thing, Cockburn became a father again with the birth of his daughter Iona. Then there was the publication of his 2014 memoir Rumours of Glory.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t write any songs until after the book was published because all my creative energy had gone into three years of writing it,\u201d Cockburn explains, from his home in San Francisco. \u201cThere was simply nothing left to write songs with. As soon as the book was put to bed, I started asking myself whether I was ever going to be a songwriter again.\u201d\n\nSuch doubt was new to the man who\u2019s rarely been at a loss for words as he\u2019s distilled political views, spiritual revelations and personal experiences into some of popular music\u2019s most compelling songs. What spurred Cockburn back into songwriting was an invitation to contribute a song to a documentary film about the late, seminal Canadian poet Al Purdy and he was off to the races.\n\nBone On Bone, Cockburn\u2019s 33rd album, arrives with 11 new songs, including \u201c3 Al Purdys,\u201d a brilliant, six-minute epic that pays tribute to Purdy\u2019s poetry. Cockburn explains its genesis: \u201cI went out and got Purdy\u2019s collected works, which is an incredible book. Then I had this vision of a homeless guy who is obsessed with Purdy\u2019s poetry, and he\u2019s ranting it on the street. The song is written in the voice of that character. The chorus goes, \u2018I'll give you three Al Purdys for a twenty dollar bill.\u2019 Here\u2019s this grey-haired dude, coat tails flapping in the wind, being mistaken for the sort of addled ranters you run into on the street\u2014except he\u2019s not really ranting, he\u2019s reciting Al Purdy. The spoken word parts of the track are excerpts from Purdy\u2019s poems. After that, once the ice was broken, the songs just started coming.\u201d\n\nCockburn\u2019s rugged fingerpicking style on the Dobro perfectly matches Purdy\u2019s plainspoken words and the grizzled voice of his street character. A similar guitar style can be heard on two of the next songs Cockburn wrote, the gospel-like \u201cJesus Train,\u201d and \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society,\u201d a bluesy number about people who gather at his local coffee shop to sip their java and talk about the state of the world.\n\nThere\u2019s a prevalent urgency and anxious tone to much of the album, which Cockburn attributes to living in America during the Trump era. But, more than anything, Bone on Bone amounts to the deepest expression of Cockburn\u2019s spiritual concerns to date. The 12-time Juno winner and Canadian Music Hall of Fame inductee turned away from traditional Christianity in the mid-1970s toward a quest for the more all-inclusive mysticism he documents in his memoir. And it\u2019s that kind of spirituality that figures prominently in \u201cJesus Train\u201d and \u201cTwelve Gates to the City.\u201d In \u201cLooking and Waiting,\u201d Cockburn sings of \u201cscanning the skies for a beacon\u201d from the divine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a song of faith and frustration,\u201d says Cockburn of the latter. \"...Tired of looking in from the outside. My MO has always been to be aware of the divine...that dimension...always dealing with being stuck in a kind of observer\u2019s position with respect to all that. I know it\u2019s there. I don't really see as faith so much as knowledge. Others may have different ideas about those things, but for me, I don\u2019t have to struggle to believe in God, or the notion that God cares what happens to me. But I do have to struggle with being in a conscious, intentional relationship. That underlies a lot of these songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cForty Years in the Wilderness\u201d ranks alongside \u201cPacing the Cage\u201d or \u201cAll the Diamonds\u201d as one of Cockburn\u2019s most starkly beautiful folk songs. \u201cThere have been so many times in my life when an invitation has come from somewhere...the cosmos...the divine...to step out of the familiar into something new. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best to listen for, and follow these promptings. The song is really about that. You can stay with what you know or you can pack your bag and go where you\u2019re called, even if it seems weird...even if you can\u2019t see why or where you\u2019ll end up.\u201d\n\n\u201cForty Years in the Wilderness\u201d is one of several songs that feature a number of singers from the church Cockburn frequents, for the sake of convenience referred to in the album credits as the San Francisco Lighthouse \u201cChorus.\u201d \u201cThe music was one of the enticements that drew me to SF Lighthouse. As I found myself becoming one of the regulars there, and got to know the people, I felt that I really wanted all these great singers, who were now becoming friends, to be on the album. They were kind enough to say yes!\u201d Among other songs, they contribute call-and-response vocals to the stirring \u201cStab at Matter.\u201d Other guests on the album include singer-songwriters Ruby Amanfu, Mary Gauthier, and Brandon Robert Young, along with bassist Roberto Occhipinti, and Julie Wolf, who plays accordion on \u201c3 Al Purdys\u201d and sings with the folks from Lighthouse, together with LA songwriter Tamara Silvera.\n\nProduced by Colin Linden, Cockburn\u2019s longtime collaborator, the album is built around the musicianship of Cockburn on guitar and the core accompaniment of bassist John Dymond and drummer Gary Craig. Also very much part of the sound is the accordion playing of Cockburn\u2019s nephew John Aaron Cockburn and the solos of noted fluegelhorn player Ron Miles (check out his stunning work on the cascading \u201cMon Chemin,\u201d for example).\n\nTwo other songs should be noted. The environmental warning \u201cFalse River\u201d came about at the invitation of Yvonne Bloomer, the poet laureate of Victoria, British Columbia. Bloomer was seeking a poem about the controversial Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline. \u201cPipelines have their own perils that we\u2019re all aware of,\u201d says Cockburn, \u201cso I started writing what was meant to be a spoken-word piece with a rhythm to it. But it evolved very quickly into a song.\u201d\n\n\u201cStates I\u2019m In,\u201d which opens the album, conjures up feelings of mystery and dread. \u201cIt\u2019s literally a \u2018dark night of the soul\u2019 kind of song,\u201d Cockburn explains, \u201cas it starts with sunset and ends with dawn. It passes through the night. The song is about illusion and self-delusion, looking at the tricks you play on yourself.\u201d He adds: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s also a play on words about me living in the States.\u201d\n\nCockburn, who won the inaugural People\u2019s Voice Award at the Folk Alliance International conference in February and will be inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in September, continues to find inspiration in the world around him and channel those ideas into songs. \u201cMy job is to try and trap the spirits of things in the scratches of pen on paper and the pulling of notes out of metal,\u201d he once noted. More than forty years after embarking on his singer-songwriting career, Cockburn keeps kicking at the darkness so that it might bleed daylight.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "627 2nd Ave, Crockett, CA 94525", "Artist": "Knocked Down ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10141309.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.223563, 38.053227], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Punk, Pop Punk, Skate Punk", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Toot's Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "A Melodic Punk band from Stockton, CA", "otherInfo": "Prizefighter, Knocked Down, Dead River Rebels"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Kofy Brown ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10215961.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "Kofy Brown, an Oakland, CA musician, singer and songwriter has been a pioneering force in the Bay Area\u2019s hip-hop soul scene since the 90\u2019s.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program.

With lyrical poetry splashing like dazzling paint across a canvas of sound, she builds layer upon layer of vocal melodies into majestic loop-pedal harmonies, weaving syncopated threads of guitar, kalimba, piano, and percussion into her live performances.\n\nAyla\u2019s music is a genre unto its own, as she allows sounds to dance between vocal looping, produced beats, live drumming, orchestral string arrangements, Celtic melodies, and even dashes of hip-hop wordplay. With an uncanny ability to disarm and crack open the heart, Ayla\u2019s lucid storytelling and magical presence rings with love, as she sings for the depth of our humanness, a truth beyond time and place, and the pure wonder of life itself.\n\nCalling us to listen deeper, her songs are elegant masterpieces of lucid storytelling, with lyrics ringing as anthems and mantras for hope, healing, and love.\n\nThough you\u2019d never know it by witnessing her perform, Ayla grew up with a deep fear of singing. In her final year of college, songs began pouring through her, and it was only through the constant urging of those around her that she began to slowly share her music. Propelled by the songs themselves, Ayla\u2019s journey of meeting those fears and singing through them has propelled her into the powerful performer she is today, touching an ever-widening global audience with the inspiring magic of her songs.\n\nA child schooled at home in the hills of Sonoma County, Ayla was raised on Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, opera, classical music, traditional celtic songs, and ABBA -- influences which have deeply shaped her music. Touching on both the timeless and modern, she always rides the line between genres, so that her songwriting and sound ultimately cannot be compared to anyone else.\n\nDancing her own songs on stage as she sings them, her movement and presence gives the audience a permission to be wild, real, vulnerable, and alive. Every performance Ayla gives is its own inspired journey; an enchanting and poignant experience that holds you by the heart and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\nAyla is releasing her 6th album in the spring of 2019 via Jumpsuit Records. Honing her artistry and craft over the years, Ayla has developed a loyal fanbase, one that has recently seen exponential growth into widening circles across the planet. The upcoming release of her phenomenal new album, \"By The Light of the Dark Moon\", marks a stepping-out into the world arena. With a nationwide tour supporting the album release, a full summer of notable festival appearances, and her second European tour on the horizon, Ayla's music is reverberating from a west-coast transformational niche into larger global audiences, to inspire and uplift the hearts of humanity. Her music has also recently seen rapid and increasing growth throughout Europe, as well as Canada, Australia, and dozens of other countries.\n\nTo date, Ayla has released 5 solo albums, 2 Wildlight albums (the collaboration project of Ayla and David Sugalski, aka The Polish Ambassador), and 3 collaboration albums.\n\n\u201cA poet, musician, visionary and mystic, Ayla Nereo is an otherworldly artist who shares the fruits of her soul.\u201d ~ The Huffington Post\n\n\u201c[Ayla\u2019s] relationship with the earth is imprinted in her music \u2026 thickly layered tracks where expansive and intriguing instrumentals serve as an intricate backdrop for her delicate and soft-spoken vocals.\u201d ~ Billboard\n\n\u201cI am here to receive songs that help us remember our origins, our incredible human potential, and our right relationship with all Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are born of dust and silence.

Following a formative decade in the global hip-hop underground, Coles took the name Om Unit in the late 2000s and began to travel across genres and scenes in search of sonic tropes to cross-breed and re-imagine. Key to his approach is a desire to never settle for the destination and instead focus on what can be learned from the journey.\n\nWhat drives Coles is a desire to keep challenging himself, and in turn his audience. Over the past five years, this has led him to distill various influences \u2014 hip-hop, dubstep, ambient, jungle, footwork \u2014 into a fluid take on sound system culture that sidesteps the pitfalls of genres and pastiche and creates new potentials for exploration and inspiration, with many following in his footsteps. It\u2019s how, in the early 2010s, he came to pioneer the stylistic and rhythmic links between jungle and footwork via a series of acclaimed edits that brought him to the attention of the drum & bass scene. This personal approach has earned Coles praise as a refreshing voice in dance music from both peers and the media.\n\nOn record, Coles\u2019 explorations into the deeper end of the electronic music spectrum have come via releases for Civil Music, including a critically acclaimed debut album, 2013\u2019s Threads, legendary drum & bass outfit Metalheadz, where he was given access to Goldie\u2019s personal sample archive as the inspiration for 2014\u2019s Inversion album, Planet Mu, for a collaboration with Machinedrum as Dream Continuum, All City Records, remixing Grammy-winning producer Om\u2019Mas Keith, Plastician\u2019s Terrorhythm, and Exit Records, where he first collaborated with Sam Binga (leading to their BUNIT series of white label releases). The same exploratory approach has made him an in-demand remixer and BBC Radio 1, Boiler Room, Resident Advisor, FACT, XLR8R, and Rinse FM have called on him to provide mixes and showcase his sound.\n\nIn 2011, Coles set up a label, Cosmic Bridge Records, through which he has exercised an A&R sensibility that has created an exciting independent home for likeminded artists. The label\u2019s releases, pressed onto limited edition vinyl runs, regularly sell out within days of their street date. Through Cosmic Bridge, Coles has championed veterans such as Kromestar and Boxcutter alongside new voices from Europe and America, including Moresounds, Danny Scrilla, and Graphs. The label\u2019s breadth is best seen in the celebrated, and award-nominated,Cosmolog compilation series Coles began overseeing in 2014. Cosmic Bridge represents a dual path of inspiration: that which Coles found in others\u2019 music, and that which others have found in his.\n\nColes is also a sought after DJ, with over 300 appearances in clubs and festivals in more than 30 countries he has made the equivalent of over a dozen trips round the globe and counting. And in line with his desire to imagine new potentials for dance music has appeared on varied bills from the Montreux Jazz Festival to Bass Coast, Outlook to Mysteryland.\n\nAfter two decades in London, Coles relocated to Bristol in 2015. From his new studio on the English west coast he continues his search through production work (the Torchlight EP series on Cosmic Bridge) and aesthetic exercises (the Gates mix series). A keen scholar of all music, he draws from the past and present to imagine the future, never content to remain in the same place for too long.", "otherInfo": "Soundpieces and Public Works team up for a triple headliner night featuring The Librarian, Om Unit, & J:Kenzo!"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "J:Kenzo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8063413.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Electronic, Underground, Dubstep", "Time": "4:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "J:Kenzo is the leading member of a new wave of artists on pioneering Dubstep label Tempa, as well as the founder of the influential Artikal Music UK imprint.

Her years in the Lebanese capital not only developed in her a singular musical aesthetic, but educated her as to the technicalities of mixing records and forming a narrative by doing so. Her sets, while rooted in high-octane, punchy techno, have a distinguished and defined ark, encompassing a broad range of sounds in their beginning and end. It\u2019s a style that can be traced back to her teachers, two DJs who instilled in her the value of adaptation and track diversity. \u201cThe music is Berlin techno, but I perceive it in a Lebanese way,\u201d Sama explains.\n\nSama\u2019s story begins in Ramallah, Palestine\u2019s de facto capital. Moving there from Jordan, her place of birth, she first connected with hip-hop and rap, the region\u2019s foremost alternative genre. A penchant for music was evident at an early age, but it was the technical side that drew her in first, leading her to study in Beirut. She returned to Palestine with a new understanding of electronic music, and brought with her the techno genre, inspiring a local community of artists that continues to flourish in the face of the geo-political restrictions imposed upon it.\n\nIntent on pursuing a career in Music Production, Sama studied Audio Engineering at SAE Institute London, the basis for two albums as Skywalker, her former alias, and a job in Cairo, Egypt, where she began working with bands and designing sound for moving picture, including Egyptian films like \u201cThe Builders\u201d and \u201cThread and Wall.\u201d She also partnered with Arabic music incubator Eka3 to start her own publishing agency, Awyav.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until much later that DJing became her focus, sparked by a run of gigs that has continued ever since. Her education in music continues to inform her work: not only has it had a big impact on how she hears sound, but she sprinkles real-life samples throughout her sets, recorded on her travels and shaped back in her studio.\n\nIn 2018, she performed at Germany\u2019s Fusion Festival and Hungary\u2019s Sziget Festival, but it was her Boiler Room set, viewed nearly 3-million times, that identified her talents to the wider electronic music community. While touring every weekend, she bases herself in Paris, France, after completing a six-month residency at the International City of Arts having been selected as a Laureate by the French Institute. In July, she completed her first Essential Mix for BBC Radio 1, opening it with a binaural recording from London\u2019s Kings Cross train station to Paris.\n\nMuch beyond the success she\u2019s already enjoying, Sama\u2019s goal has always been to put Palestine on the musical map. While she continues to excel on all fronts, she uses her status as a rising touring DJ to support the growing number of musicians at home. Besides advising them on the challenges they\u2019ll face, she\u2019s recently set up Union, an artistic community in Ramallah that also serves as a platform for DJs and producers to better their skills.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "146 S Murphy Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94086", "Artist": "MitiS ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8594497.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.029756, 37.376782], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Dubstep, Drum&bass, Chillwave, Electronic, Electro, Drumstep, House", "Time": "5:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Pure Lounge & Nightclub", "moreBioInfo": "MitiS has been perfecting his special breed of piano-driven melodic bass since 2010.
