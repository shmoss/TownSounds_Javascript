Tim grew up in Tabernacle, New Jersey, a small town tucked within the state's densely forested coastal plain known as the Pine Barrens. He originally set out as a drummer, playing for local cover bands which frequently gigged local bars and college parties in the tri-state area. While attending college, Tim began to experiment with guitar. He became especially fascinated with song-writing and recording. He began co-writing and recording and producing with the New Jersey based band Dog Show Blues. During this time he also worked on what would later become his debut album. Attributing much of his inspiration to his three older brothers, he named the solo project The Fourth Son. His debut album The Fourth Son EP was released in 2014. In the winter of 2015, The Fourth Son relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, and began developing a live presence. He played at open-mic nights throughout the Bay Area, while teaching elementary physical education by day. He released his second album titled Lavenia in 2016. With an increasing number of tour dates the project has developed a unique and powerful live sound. The one-man band switches between acoustic and electric guitar, backed by a kick drum and foot-tambourine.

They went from recording their first album, \"Getting By\" (2007) in a tiny living room to winning UVA's Battle of the Bands in 2008 and opening up for national touring acts like OKGO and Parachute. From there the band's music started to spring up all over the country through word of mouth and grassroots efforts. Their song \"The Hymn\" was even featured in the international Taiwanese film, \"Lovesick.\" The band was growing steadily as they released their second record \"From The Inside\" in 2009 which featured their popular single \"Analyze\" produced by Regan Sprenkle and Chris Keup (Jason Mraz, Parachute, Lifehouse). But in 2011, someone filed a lawsuit against the band while they were finishing up their record, \"Humanity.\" For the next few years immediately following the release of their 3rd record, the band went underground. They stopped all their publicity, all new releases, and halted any major tours in an attempt to weather out the storm without making their legal situation a public spectacle. But the litigation did not end and it only got more expensive. Realizing they could no longer sit and wait for the situation to resolve itself, they fought back with the only they could: music. At the end of 2013, the band reemerged with a brand new album, Mighty Sound. In the face of unending and expensive litigation, TBT enlisted the help of their friends and community to record their 4th album. Composed out of the frustrations of time lost and tears shed, they resolved not to make the album a lament about the past 3 years. Instead the sound would be triumphant. And so the band birthed anthemic songs like, \u201cFools Marching\u201d, \u201cWasted\u201d, \u201cMighty Sound\u201d, and \u201cThe Battle Hymn.\u201d On Nov 23, 2013, Tim wrote in his first public blog post since 2011, \u201cWhile the songs on Mighty Sound were birthed within struggle, I resolved to create something that would celebrate the triumphs within the disappointments, instead of mourning in the ruins of our wailing wall. I didn\u2019t pen these songs because of our troubles; I wrote these songs in spite of them. Because it\u2019s easy to complain about hardship, but it\u2019s much harder to be grateful for what is good in the midst of it... After all, money is one of those things you can always make back, but time wasted on worry, bitterness and fear is time that is lost for good.\u201d Even in the midst of difficulty, the band has seen multiple dreams and aspirations come to fruition. Tim had the honor of performing the national anthem on Veterans Day for the 2015 NBA champions, The Golden State Warriors, fulfilling a childhood dream of singing the anthem at a major sporting event. He produced and sang on MC Jin's latest album XIV:LIX fulfilling a childhood dream to sing a hook on a rap song.

She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins.

In the wake of 2016's jarring political shift, Friedberger felt a need to be even more self-reliant, right down to the album artwork, in which she painted a backdrop and styled herself as an attempt to look like an amped up Lizzy Mercier Descloux.\n\nIn contrast to the sonic serenity of 2016's New View, which she arranged and recorded with her touring band, Rebound was recorded mostly on her own and with the producer Clemens Knieper. Programmed drums, a Juno synthesizer, and muted rhythm guitars dominate the landscape where influences range from Stereolab and Suicide to Lena Platonos and Yellow Magic Orchestra.\n\nFrom Eleanor:\n\nI spent most of 2016 on the road, and I needed to keep that momentum going. I had always wanted to spend more time in Greece; take Greek lessons and get to know Athens better while hopefully writing some music. After November 8, 2016 I set that loose plan into motion. While friends back home were suddenly becoming politically activated for the first time, it was exciting to be living in a city where protest marches occur on a weekly, or sometimes daily basis. I assembled a band of Greek musicians, played a few shows, learned a few more Greek words, but didn't get much writing done. It turned out to be more of a reconnaissance mission.\n\nAfter a month in Athens I asked my friend, the Greek musician \u03a3tella, \"What's one thing I have to do before I leave?\" After some long and careful consideration she smiled and said, \"you have to go to Rebound. It's a time warp; kind of an 80s goth disco where everyone does the chicken dance; you\u2019ll love it... but it's only open on Saturdays after 3:00 AM.\" Rebound proved to be a revelation in terms of finding the sound and energy for my fourth album. The club was very dark and despite the no smoking signs, like everywhere in Athens, it was very smoky. The \"chicken dance\" Stella mentioned was a solitary one. I copied the slouchy strut, moving back and forth in line, swinging my arms in time to the music that at first sounded like Joy Division or maybe The Cure, but never revealed itself-- one could only assume it to be knock-off by an unknown Baltic band. It was alienating and exhilarating. \"In Between Stars\" is an attempt at a song you could hear at Rebound. It's a dark and disorienting; my warped version of 80s goth disco.\n\nStay tuned in the coming weeks for more details from the story of Eleanor Friedberger's Rebound coming out on Frenchkiss Records on May 4th, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2424 Mariposa St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "The Live Bawdy Storytelling Show", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9379356.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.407929, 37.763394], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Verdi Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "SEE BOTH SHOWS WITH A FULL EVENING WRISTBAND!\n\nSaturday February 22nd, 2020\nat the Verdi Club (2424 Mariposa, San Francisco, CA)\nRemember: Bang-O at 6:00 PM, Stories at 7:00 PM\n(NOTE: This is our Early Show)\nTickets at http://bit.ly/BawdyLucky13\nOr see BOTH SHOWS with a Full Evening Wristband!\nWant to sample Bawdy Storytelling?

Joe\u2019s memoir, The Man Who Outgrew His Prison Cell, tells the story of how his home life turned brutal until he picked up a steak knife and plunged it into his father\u2019s neck. The book details his subsequent descent into crime, culminating with a 30-bank heist spree and eventual arrest. He ended up in solitary confinement for almost 2 years, where he returned to his boyhood dream of one day becoming a writer. He discovered his voice on the page, and the trajectory of his life was permanently altered.\nAfter his release, He joined the Board of Directors for Walden House, a reentry program. He has conducted writing workshops in reentry facilities and prisons all across California.\nJoe became a talking head on TV, sharing his opinions about crime, culture and religion on CNN, Nightline, CBS News/48 Hours, and Court TV. He even argued with Bill O\u2019Reilly on his TV show, The O\u2019Reilly Factor.\nJoe\u2019s critically acclaimed memoir, The Man Who Outgrew His Prison Cell: Confessions Of A Bank Robber was published in 2004. That same year he began a correspondence with an incarcerated woman. He encouraged her to write about her life. Piper Kerman was eventually released from prison and published one of Joe\u2019s letters in her bestselling memoir, Orange Is the New Black.\nIn 2010, Joe published his award-winning essay Soundtracking A Bank Robbery in McSweeney\u2019s magazine. Film director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) read the essay and contacted Joe to consult on his Baby Driver film script.

In 2000, Sanchez and his ensemble won the Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album for their work on the Concord Picante album Latin Soul. A jazz great in himself, Sanchez has performed with artists Cal Tjader, Mongo Santamaria, Hugh Masakela, Clare Fischer and Tower of Power, among others.\n\nThe youngest of eleven children, Poncho Sanchez was born in Laredo, the seat of Webb County, Texas. He was reared in Norwalk, California. Growing up, Sanchez was exposed to and influenced by two very different styles of music: Afro-Cuban music (mambo, son, cha-cha, rumba, guaracha, salsa) by greats such as Tito Puente, and bebop jazz, including the works of Charlie Parker. Originally a guitarist, he discovered his talent for singing during an audition for an R&B band that rehearsed across the street from where he lived, becoming the lead vocalist of the group. Sanchez would later go on to teach himself the flute, drums, and timbales before finally deciding to pursue conga-playing in high school.\n\nIn 1975, at age 23, Sanchez's idol, vibraphonist Cal Tjader, invited him to perform one set with his band. Seeing the young man's talent, Tjader hired Sanchez for a week before officially making him a full member of the ensemble. Sanchez played a crucial role as conguero for several years until Tjader's death in 1982.\n\nBefore he died, Tjader suggested that Concord Records founder Carl Jefferson sign Sanchez and his soon-to-be-formed group under the Concord Picante label. Tjader's wishes were honored, and the first two records were composed and arranged by long-time Tjader collaborator Clare Fischer.\n\nPoncho Sanchez went on to produce 19 albums for the label, eventually garnering a Grammy for his work. Currently, Sanchez is respected as one of the top American percussionists of our time. He performs frequently in venues varying in size from concert halls to local jazz festivals.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Big Butterfly @ Terrapin Crossroads! Zach Ostroff*Scott Amendola* w/ Adam Nash!

Their first LP, One Truth, was released in 1994 by Victory Records to both critical acclaim and tremendous sales. At the time, their speed-metal style of hardcore was considered revolutionary, and their message of Straight Edge activism and positive life style was a refreshing contrast to the typical music popular at the time. Strife was considered one of the three \"Big\" bands on the then-new Victory Records label, sharing that title with Hardcore legends Earth Crisis and Snapcase. Strife released their sophomore album, In This Defiance in 1997. This album was also well regarded by the Straight Edge/Hardcore community. It was also notable for the guest appearances, with Chino Moreno of Deftones, Dino Cazares of Fear Factory and Igor Cavalera of Sepultura all taking turns on the album. Two years later, Strife broke up, citing creative differences and exhaustion. Victory Records released Truth Through Defiance, a compilation of live tracks and previously unreleased material. In 2001, Strife reformed and released Angermeans. No longer Straight Edge, this album was considered by the band to be a more mature and focused continuation of In This Defiance.\nFast forward to 2012, and Strife is back in the studio to create their newest album, Witness A Rebirth. After touring throughout the world in recent years, STRIFE decided it was time to unleash a new batch of songs and break their 11 years streak of recording silence.

Their first LP, One Truth, was released in 1994 by Victory Records to both critical acclaim and tremendous sales. At the time, their speed-metal style of hardcore was considered revolutionary, and their message of Straight Edge activism and positive life style was a refreshing contrast to the typical music popular at the time. Strife was considered one of the three \"Big\" bands on the then-new Victory Records label, sharing that title with Hardcore legends Earth Crisis and Snapcase. Strife released their sophomore album, In This Defiance in 1997. This album was also well regarded by the Straight Edge/Hardcore community. It was also notable for the guest appearances, with Chino Moreno of Deftones, Dino Cazares of Fear Factory and Igor Cavalera of Sepultura all taking turns on the album. Two years later, Strife broke up, citing creative differences and exhaustion. Victory Records released Truth Through Defiance, a compilation of live tracks and previously unreleased material. In 2001, Strife reformed and released Angermeans. No longer Straight Edge, this album was considered by the band to be a more mature and focused continuation of In This Defiance.\nFast forward to 2012, and Strife is back in the studio to create their newest album, Witness A Rebirth. After touring throughout the world in recent years, STRIFE decided it was time to unleash a new batch of songs and break their 11 years streak of recording silence.

They are perhaps best known for their political activism, particularly their views on the environment and animal rights. Earth Crisis was the band responsible for bringing these issues to the forefront of the hardcore scene in the mid-nineties.\n\nEarth Crisis' chugging riffs and barked declarations served as the mouthpiece of America's militant vegan straight-edge movement throughout the '90s, detailing the ideas of animal and human liberation, drug-free living, and personal empowerment through hardcore song. The vegan straight-edge movement spawned activists who took the law into their own hands, burning down fur farms and freeing animals directly. Earth Crisis began as the brainchild of Karl Buechner -- who intended to play bass -- and his friend DJ Rose. The lineup eventually solidified with Buechner on vocals, Ian \"Bulldog\" Edwards on bass, guitarist Scott Crouse, drummer Mike Ricardi, and a guitarist named Ben. This lineup began playing around Syracuse, spreading the message of veganism and the drug-free lifestyle previously preached in the hardcore scene by Vegan Reich, Statement, and Raid. Earth Crisis crafted a five-song demo and sent it to the label that had released those bands' records, Hardline. But with that label on hiatus, they decided to release their first EP through a local friend's imprint, Conviction. All Out War came out on 7\" single format, with the band embarking upon their first U.S. tour in support of it. Drummer Dennis Merrick -- who would become almost as important in shaping the band's political ideology as Buechner -- came aboard around this time as Ricardi was unable to commit himself to touring. The interest that built up in the hardcore scene around the band, along with a new demo, brought Earth Crisis to the attention of Chicago's Victory label and a deal was signed. Earth Crisis set about making their first EP for the label; Firestorm was a landmark release for the hardcore scene that combined staccato, solo-free metal with barking, political, and militant vocals. The lyrics centered around the dangers of drug abuse and bringing \"violence against violence\" to drug dealers and those who would abuse animals: \"a firestorm to purify.\"\n\nThe Earth Crisis phenomenon was now in full swing, but Ben was asked to leave the band and was replaced by guitarist Kris Weichman. The group next crafted their debut full-length album, Destroy the Machines, which was released in 1995. Victory also secured the rights to All Out War, reissuing it on CD, 7\", and cassette format. The band traveled to Europe, where they were amassing quite a dedicated following. Earth Crisis set about touring the States again as well, first with Guilt, Ignite, and Damnation AD and next supporting Shelter. While on tour in the northwestern United States, they were involved in a serious van crash that hospitalized Merrick for some time. While home recuperating, the rest of the group -- together with Rose, Ricardi, and another friend -- made a project album under the moniker Path of Resistance as Earth Crisis popularity began to increase.\n\nMajor media outlets such as MTV, CNN, and CBS started covering Earth Crisis and vegan straight-edge in general. In 1996, the band released their second full-length album, Gomorrah's Season Ends, a polished and decidedly more metallic affair that produced even more anthems that became singalong worthy staples of their live performances. Though Victory was growing in size alongside the band, offers from bigger, more established and more widely distributed labels began to pour in. The band was asked to take part in the inaugural Ozzfest. Earth Crisis released a live album, The Oath That Keeps Me Free, through Victory and then signed a contract with then-indie metal giant Roadrunner Records, home to acts such as Fear Factory and Sepultura. They also fired Weichman, replacing him with Edwards' brother Erick, late of the band Beta Minus Mechanic. Their first and only album for the label, Breed the Killers, was released simultaneously on vinyl through Equal Vision. It was solid, with production by Andy Sneep and a guest vocal appearance by Machine Head frontman Robb Flynn. Earth Crisis toured relentlessly behind the record, but it failed to generate much more of a buzz than any of their previous releases had already. With dissatisfaction mounting on both sides, Earth Crisis severed ties with Roadrunner and returned \"home\" to Victory. What followed was perhaps the best work of their career, the decidedly nu metal flavored Slither. Its incredibly well produced, structured, and catchy songs included singing, rapping, and more obtuse and personally oriented lyrics. It was tantamount to a massive \"sell-out\" to many fans, however, and poor turnouts at subsequent tour stops reflected this. Earth Crisis' next release was a collection of demo, rare, and cover tracks called Last of the Sane. In 2001, they announced their breakup, playing a triumphant final performance at Hellfest in their hometown of Syracuse. A DVD and best-of collection were released soon after. Buechner formed a new band called Nemesis. Crouse and Merrick have teamed up in a progressive, heavy rock group named Slave One. Frontman Karl Buechner along with Bulldog and Erick Edwards started the band Freya.\n\nThe band reunited in 2006.", "otherInfo": "Snapcase / Earth Crisis / Strife"}, {"Address": "427 Mendocino Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95401", "Artist": "Daniel Steinbock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9184179.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.715214, 38.441851], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk, Singer, Songwriter, Indie Folk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Lost Church Santa Rosa", "moreBioInfo": "Daniel Steinbock was born and raised on the California coast north of the Golden Gate, the only child of a sailor and a librarian.

The original members include Brian Brannon (vocals), Don \"Redondo\" Pendleton (guitar), Michael Cornelius (bass), and Mike \"Bam-Bam\" Sversvold (drums). Alan Bishop of Sun City Girls also played bass for awhile. The band was pivotal in the development of the skate punk and Skate Rock scenes. Over the years, the lineup has included many bass players and drummers but the core of Brannon and Pendleton has remained constant.\n\nJFA was formed around March of 1981. Pendleton, then in the band The Deez and Cornelius, then in the band Jr. Chemists, knew each other from shows around Phoenix, Arizona and from skateboarding. They began playing together after a D.O.A. concert during the band's Hardcore 81 tour. Bam-Bam later joined after meeting Pendleton at an \"Industrial Dance\" in Phoenix, and bestowed the moniker on the band, which is a reference to his second-cousin's, John Hinckley, Jr., attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe band's first show was opening for Black Flag at an Industrial Dance which was one of a series of early Phoenix punk shows. Their first song of the night was Pipetruck.\n\nPlacebo Records released their debut EP \"Out Of School\" in late 1981. The band toured the west extensively and played many local shows.

As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland. He began playing in a variety of Bay Area blues and soul bands in his early 20s, making a name for himself as a hotter than hot live artist. In 1985 he became lead singer and guitarist for the locally popular blues band NiteCry, and began gigging regularly throughout Northern California.\n\nCastro joined Warner Brothers\u2019 artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s, gigging all over the country. He formed the first Tommy Castro Band in 1991, releasing his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig. He hit the road hard, picking up new followers everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Television\u2019s Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label.\n\nCastro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer to massive acclaim. He won four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. His next release, 2011\u2019s Tommy Castro Presents The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue\u2013Live!, was a boisterous and searing collection of highlights from a series of live performances anchored by Castro and an all-star collection of blues giants, including Rick Estrin, Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks and Joe Louis Walker. His relentless road-dog approach\u2014gig after gig, night after night\u2014has won him loyal, lifelong fans everywhere he plays.

The band released The Devil You Know in 2014 and Method To My Madness in 2015, with critics shouting praise and admirers cheering his every move. Castro had stripped his music down to its raw essence with the new, smaller band, sounding bigger than ever. On record and on stage, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers\u2019 road-hardened, seemingly telepathic musicianship bring an unmatched passion to Castro\u2019s blue-eyed California soul and hard-rocking, good-time songs. His hometown newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle, describes Castro\u2019s music as, \u201cfunky Southern soul, big city blues and classic rock...silvery guitar licks that simultaneously sound familiar and fresh.\u201d\n\nWith months of tour dates across the U.S. and Europe, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers will be bringing the songs from their new album directly to their fans.

She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others.\n\nTuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz.\n\nIn 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day.\n\nIn 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan.\n\nThat's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3301 Lyon St, San Francisco, CA 94123", "Artist": "Katie Ferrara", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9021863.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.448345, 37.802902], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Pop, Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Palace Of Fine Arts Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Katie Ferrara is an alternative-pop singer songwriter who began her career by singing on the street as a \"busker\" in Burbank, California.

As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland.

The original members include Brian Brannon (vocals), Don \"Redondo\" Pendleton (guitar), Michael Cornelius (bass), and Mike \"Bam-Bam\" Sversvold (drums). Alan Bishop of Sun City Girls also played bass for awhile. The band was pivotal in the development of the skate punk and Skate Rock scenes. Over the years, the lineup has included many bass players and drummers but the core of Brannon and Pendleton has remained constant.\n\nJFA was formed around March of 1981. Pendleton, then in the band The Deez and Cornelius, then in the band Jr. Chemists, knew each other from shows around Phoenix, Arizona and from skateboarding. They began playing together after a D.O.A. concert during the band's Hardcore 81 tour. Bam-Bam later joined after meeting Pendleton at an \"Industrial Dance\" in Phoenix, and bestowed the moniker on the band, which is a reference to his second-cousin's, John Hinckley, Jr., attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe band's first show was opening for Black Flag at an Industrial Dance which was one of a series of early Phoenix punk shows. Their first song of the night was Pipetruck.\n\nPlacebo Records released their debut EP \"Out Of School\" in late 1981. The band toured the west extensively and played many local shows. Their first national tour was in the summer of 1983 following the release of their first album \"Valley ot the Yakes\".\n\nwww.myspace.com/jfamusic", "otherInfo": "THE FACTION + JFA + Boob - The Ritz"}, {"Address": "222 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Tuck & Patti", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7308627.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.409274, 37.785697], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Feinstein's at The Nikko", "moreBioInfo": "Tuck & Patti, that's Tuck Andress and Patti Cathcart - a couple that have been making music together for over 25 years and who released ten albums flavoured with jazz, pop, rhythm and blues, gospel, folk, rock and Brazilian genres since 1988 as a duo.\n\nPatti hails from San Francisco and knew from the age of six that she wanted to be a singer. She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others.\n\nTuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz.\n\nIn 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day.\n\nIn 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan.\n\nThat's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Oakland, CA", "Artist": "David J (Official)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9644112.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2714, 37.8045], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Blues, Acoustic, Avant Garde, Rock, Alternative, Jazz, Goth", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Private Event", "moreBioInfo": "www.davidjonline.com\nwww.bauhausmusik.com\nhttps://www.patreon.com/davidj", "otherInfo": "www.davidjonline.com"}, {"Address": "924 Gilman St, Berkeley, CA 94706", "Artist": "SOUL SKA", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9555947.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299296, 37.879505], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, Ska, Reggae, Ska Revival", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "924 Gilman", "moreBioInfo": "Featuring members of Vinyl, Monophonics, Stymie and The Pimp Jones Luv Orchestra, The Right Time, Jethro Jeremiah Band, and El Radio Fantastique.

The fledgling act still needed a moniker and the name \"Niviane\" was suggested by guitarist Claudeous Creamer. The final piece of the puzzle had yet to be found, but as fate would have it in the spring of 2015 vocalist Norman Skinner was preparing to start a new project and was contacted by an associate of the band. Within a week the two camps had demoed 3 songs and the original full Niviane line-up was born.\n\nTwo months later on May 15th, 2015 the band debuted their music live for the first time at The Knitting Factory in Reno, Nevada. Delivering a high-energy performance complete with duel lead guitar attacks and high-soaring vocals, the band began a run of successful show dates. Niviane continued to perform live and write for the debut album through the end of 2015.\n\nThe group in its infancy was gaining much deserved attention but with a new year came a new line-up. 2016 would begin with Claudeous Creamer & Mark Sprague parting ways with the band and being replaced by guitarist Gary Tarplee & drummer Noe Luna. Without missing a step the band continued forward, performing live while completing the writing process and pre-production for their first album.\n\nIn May 2016 the band entered Alien Productions Studios with JK Northrup at the helm to begin recording the debut album \u201cThe Druid King\u201d. Upon completing a majority of the tracking the decision was made to recruit the talents of Aaron Robitsch to write and record keyboards for the album.

Still, you take what you can get, and it was ridiculously cheap. In this room, equipped with a dual-cassette recorder, John D. started setting some of his poetry to music, using a guitar he'd gotten for a few bucks at a nearby strip mall music store. His idea at the time was that eventually his day job would be \"poet.\" Young men have all kinds of crazy ideas about what they're going to end up doing for a living.\n\nAfter a while the songs became more like songs than poems set to music, and John started playing them for his friend Rachel, who as it turned out, played bass. John and Rachel toured the eastern U.S. & Europe once, the midwest twice (if \"Chicago, Columbus and Madison\" count as \"the midwest\"), and played San Francisco a few times, and they recorded two albums and a couple of EPs. Then John graduated from college and moved to Chicago, and the Mountain Goats became Mainly Just John, except for a couple of European tours where John's friend Peter Hughes played bass. In 2001, though, 4AD called up and asked if the Mountain Goats wouldn't like to make records with them. John called Peter. They hit the studio.\n\nAs a duo, the two toured at a pace that can fairly be called \"relentless\" from 2002 until 2007. They made records: Tallahassee, We Shall All Be Healed, The Sunset Tree, Get Lonely. They took to recruiting drummers from their opening acts to play the last few songs with them. And then they met Jon Wurster, and the three took to the road in support of Get Lonely, from Fairbanks, Alaska to Hobart, Tasmania, and a few points even further south. They enjoyed playing together so much that when it came time to repair to the studio again, all three went in. In 2008, the three recorded Heretic Pride, and in early 2009, The Life of the World to Come.\n\nhttp://www.mountain-goats.com/bio.html", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "222 Hyde St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Melissa Shoshahi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8503228.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.415493, 37.782989], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "Genres: Standup Comedy, Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Setup", "moreBioInfo": "Stand-up comedian and writer.

This Night, Destroyer album number 5 and Bejar\u2019s debut on Merge Records, was released in the fall of 2002 and continued to raise the bar, confounding perceptions of what exactly Destroyer was, or could be.

An unapologetic send up of rock and roll excess and conceit, This Night confused and amused in equal portions.\n\nBut it was not long before Bejar was busy cooking up plans to turn the tables once again. Your Blues turned everything on its head with a vainglorious retreat from the American rock tradition. Released in the fall of 2004, Your Blues was a MIDI-synthesizer symphony celebrating an exercise in old-world excess, exploring what Bejar dubbed \u201cEuropean Blues\u201d.\n\nWhen Dan decided to take Your Blues on the road for the most extensive touring of Destroyer\u2019s career, he tore it all down again. Not even attempting to recreate the synth-heavy extravagance of the recordings, Bejar instead recruited Victoria spazz-rockers Frog Eyes as his backing band, rebuilding the songs from scratch for the live performance. The results were chronicled on the Notorious Lightning And Other Works EP, released in the spring of 2005.\n\nOver the more than 10 years that Dan Bejar has been performing and recording as Destroyer, there have been numerous lineup changes and shifts within \u201cthe band\u201d. This ever-evolving shuffle of musicians has led some to consider Destroyer as a solo project, but Dan has always insisted that he sees Destroyer as a band, with full contributions from his collaborators. Admittedly he\u2019s just never been very good at the logistics of keeping a band together.\n\nAll that is about to change as Bejar assures us that the current line-up of Destroyer that emerged from the recording sessions for Destroyer\u2019s Rubies shall be the definitive and permanent line up for the band from this point forward. Many members here have performed with Bejar in one form or another before, some on previous Destroyer albums. From the sound of things on this record, it will be a band to be reckoned with. We would also be remiss not to point out that the glue that holds all of this together are Dan\u2019s longtime collaborators, the production team of JC/DC (John Collins and Dave Carswell).\n\nA new year, 2006, marks the return of Vancouver\u2019s Dan Bejar with his seventh full-length release under the moniker Destroyer. If there has been any precedent set or pattern developed over the previous six recordings in the Destroyer canon, it\u2019s that Bejar holds little regard for convention or expectations. Never one to rest on laurels, each successive Destroyer release always explores new sonic territories and ideas.\n\nThe new album is titled Destroyer\u2019s Rubies and the opening track, \u201cRubies,\u201d sets the tone well. It\u2019s 9 and 1/2 minutes long, a sprawling epic that opens with the phrase: \u201cCast myself towards infinity, trust me, I had my reasons\" the perfect summation of the Destroyer aesthetic.\n\nDestroyer\u2019s Rubies is a collection of shrewd pop music that takes no prisoners and asks no pardons. Equal parts cynicism, disdain, hope and humor; self-referential, self-mocking, sagacious and coy. There is mythology here, there is history, there is heartbreak and there is triumph. Follow along as Bejar leaves his breadcrumb trail twisting through the crumbling forests and bleak landscapes of modern popular music. It\u2019s all heady and ecstatic. Trust him, he has his reasons.\n\nBejar\u2019s Dylanesque flare for biting and sardonic wit and his nods to the glam and bombastic folk approaches of early T. Rex and Bowie recordings have clearly distanced Destroyer from the more straightforward pop of his \u201cother\u201d band, The New Pornographers. But you can hear a few more colloquial pop hooks seeping into the formula here, just to sweeten the pot. Bejar himself claims that influences on Destroyer\u2019s Rubies come from the works of Kevin Coyne, Kevin \u00c5yers, Kevin Rowlands, Kevin Junior\u2026 pretty much anyone named Kevin.\n\nSpeaking of those New Pornographers, fans and critics have often tried to decipher the extent of Mr. Bejar\u2019s contributions to their favorite Canadian supergroup (ack!), but he has always maintained a distance and mystery about his level of involvement. The truth is his participation has consisted of a few songs contributed to the cause over the years, and a few vocal performances on record. Bejar does not consider himself an official member. However, in the fall of 2005 Destroyer did head out on the road for a support slot on the New Pornographers North American tour, and Bejar was persuaded to perform a few songs live with the Pornographers for the first time in years.

He just kind of was. Or wasn\u2019t. Was or wasn\u2019t, depending. In his quest for satisfaction, he found himself susceptible to hollow promises. He drank Coke, but it did not make him smile. He used Old Spice, but beautiful women did not whistle at him. He wore Air Jordans, but jumped no higher. And one day he awoke from a beautiful dream to find himself still lying next to the wife he neither loved nor hated. Lying still, still lying. Same gray room, same gray life. He knew he had to slip away. It took only a slight turn of the wheel.\nLife in the Psychedelic Swamp, a refracted reflection of reality, gave Phrases all that he was looking for. Music took on new dimensions. Food tasted better. Love was sweeter. At least initially. The swamp was draped heavily with abstraction, where there was nothing too garbled, random or chaotic to be separated from the absolute need for meaning.\n\nBut soon the same old hollowness crept back into his soul. The romance of harvesting dry rot and herding acorn weevils under the swamp\u2019s moon-sun had dulled into a humdrum kind of workaday existence. He began to regret his decision to leave Earth for the Psychedelic Swamp. Things were not really better there, only different. Remember what the old swamp folks say: The bladderwort is always yellower on the other side of the schist. This was his epiphany. Life, flawed as it is, is meant to embraced.\n\nIt was this message, more or less, that came through on that funky old cassette tape in the mail. And \u201cPlay Me,\u201d didn\u2019t mean simply \u201cListen to Me,\u201d but literally \u201cPlay Me!\u201d It was a call to action, urging Dr. Dog to record a great pop album, to give meaning to Phrases, backed by oohs and ahhs and layered harmonies, to top the charts, capture the imagination and bring joy to the people.\nWhy us, the band wondered. They were so young, mostly just a cover band, sort of lost in their own verdant vegetative environment, fiddling around in the basement with a loose assemblage of chords and riffs, on equipment held together with duct tape and rust. They were not ready. To do justice to \u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp,\u201d they first had to find themselves as a band. They were flawed, reluctant messengers, like Spider-Man or Siddhartha, bestowed with a responsibility they did not yet accept. They needed to face the trials and tribulations of life on the road, to hone their skills as songwriters and performers.\nYears went by, and the band became bogged down in life of a recording-touring rock\u2019n\u2019roll operation. The tape was often lost, only to be found in dusty corners or falling out of a seldom used guitar case. Someday, the band vowed, we will get back to \u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp.\u201d\nThat day is now. Swamp is on. Phrases will be heard.\n\n\u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp\u201d is Dr. Dog\u2019s ninth album, and third studio release with the ANTI- label. Most of the songs were among the first ever written together by Scott McMicken and Toby Leaman along with the friends and cohorts that would evolve into Dr. Dog. This early endeavor helped shape their worldview of a label-defying, multi-hyphenated indie-psychedelic-rock-folk-basement-Americana-touring band. Many artists might cringe at the idea of revisiting the works of their younger selves. Not Dr. Dog. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked back at that time with anything other than real affection,\u201d McMicken said. \u201cThe original tape could have disappeared and never been heard again, and I still would have held it dear to my heart, because it was the closest I\u2019ve ever been to a true creative process.\u201d\nIf the seeds that were planted in \u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp\u201d helped give voice to many of Dr. Dog\u2019s songs over the years, this revisiting finds the fruit of 15 years of collaboration in full bloom. Fans will recognize the harmonies, the puckish wordplay and the introspection, but it\u2019s impossible to place these songs in the Dr. Dog chronology. The album opens with \u201cThe Golden Hind\u201d echoing the dreamy low-fi pops and whistles found on the album \u201cEasy Beat\u201d (2005), while the next song, \u201cDead Record Player,\u201d could just as easily been found among the smooth front-stoop soul of \u201cB-Room\u201d (2013). It\u2019s as if past, present and future Dr. Dog are collaborating in a kind of timeless recording studio. Even the songs within \u201cPsychedelic Swamp\u201d borrow from each other: Leaman\u2019s \u201cBring My Baby Back\u201d is a whole song sprung from a single line in \u201cEngineer Says.\u201d\nLeaman says this is not a rock opera with a traditional A-to-Z narrative arc, but rather a tapestry of Phrases\u2019 search for happiness. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable calling it a concept album, for sure,\u201d he says.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "17 Broadway Blvd, Fairfax, CA 94930", "Artist": "Matt Jaffe", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8945081.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.587997, 37.986787], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Rock, Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "19 Broadway", "moreBioInfo": "Matt Jaffe is a 24 year old rock & roll singer/songwriter from San Francisco.

By the end of the year, they had signed with Fowl Records and recorded their first LP, Just an American Band which was released in the beginning of 1983.\n\nThe band then embarked on a tour to promote their first album but Brett soon left Verbal Abuse to join the army so Nicki asked former Sick Pleasure bandmate Dave \"Koko\" Chavez to take his place.\n\nHowever, hardcore was starting to fade away and crossover thrash was the big thing in the mid '80's so Nicki quit the band in 1984. Since Joie, Dave and Gregg wanted to continue making music, They asked Condemned to Death singer Scotty Wilkins to sing.\n\n1986 they recorded their second album, V.A. Rocks Your Liver, which was released on Boner Records.\n\nThe band continued to tour but Joie eventually left to join another band in 1987, being replaced by Andy Schuman. Gregg also left for family reasons a bit later, being replaced by former Condemned to Death drummer Mike Chubka who left in 1987 .\n\nIn 1989 Chris Kontos joined up after Gregg James was unable to make the European tour. Verbal Abuse was asked to take M.D.C. place because they were unable to make the trip. Off they went for 38 shows in 42 days with Destiny booking. At the end of that tour Destiny asked if they would record a \"Live Recording\". Out of that came \"Passport- Verbal Abuse of America\" released on Destiny records.\n\n1990 saw Destiny bringing VA back to Europe to tour off the Live recording.\n\nThey recorded another album entitled Red, White and Violent and released in 1995 on Century Media Records. They toured for this record and split about a year later as Scotty joined Electric Frankenstein.\n\nJoie Mastrokalos resurfaced playing guitar for his good friend Duff McKagan's band in 1993 and 1994. He contributed on Duff's solo album Believe in Me and the following solo tours that ensued.\n\nIn 1996, the band got a lot of recognition and newfound interest when thrash metal legends Slayer covered five of their songs on their Undisputed Attitude record. The songs covered are Disintegration, Free Money, Verbal Abuse, Leeches and I Hate You.\n\nNicki having been released from prison and money from the Slayer album royalties brought the band back together in the 21st century, now with Nicki back on Vocals, Andy on guitar, Dave on bass as well as new members Jess Aaron on second guitar and Geza Szent-Galy on drums.

By the end of the year, they had signed with Fowl Records and recorded their first LP, Just an American Band which was released in the beginning of 1983.\n\nThe band then embarked on a tour to promote their first album but Brett soon left Verbal Abuse to join the army so Nicki asked former Sick Pleasure bandmate Dave \"Koko\" Chavez to take his place.\n\nHowever, hardcore was starting to fade away and crossover thrash was the big thing in the mid '80's so Nicki quit the band in 1984. Since Joie, Dave and Gregg wanted to continue making music, They asked Condemned to Death singer Scotty Wilkins to sing.\n\n1986 they recorded their second album, V.A. Rocks Your Liver, which was released on Boner Records.\n\nThe band continued to tour but Joie eventually left to join another band in 1987, being replaced by Andy Schuman. Gregg also left for family reasons a bit later, being replaced by former Condemned to Death drummer Mike Chubka who left in 1987 .\n\nIn 1989 Chris Kontos joined up after Gregg James was unable to make the European tour. Verbal Abuse was asked to take M.D.C. place because they were unable to make the trip. Off they went for 38 shows in 42 days with Destiny booking. At the end of that tour Destiny asked if they would record a \"Live Recording\". Out of that came \"Passport- Verbal Abuse of America\" released on Destiny records.\n\n1990 saw Destiny bringing VA back to Europe to tour off the Live recording.\n\nThey recorded another album entitled Red, White and Violent and released in 1995 on Century Media Records. They toured for this record and split about a year later as Scotty joined Electric Frankenstein.\n\nJoie Mastrokalos resurfaced playing guitar for his good friend Duff McKagan's band in 1993 and 1994. He contributed on Duff's solo album Believe in Me and the following solo tours that ensued.\n\nIn 1996, the band got a lot of recognition and newfound interest when thrash metal legends Slayer covered five of their songs on their Undisputed Attitude record. The songs covered are Disintegration, Free Money, Verbal Abuse, Leeches and I Hate You.\n\nNicki having been released from prison and money from the Slayer album royalties brought the band back together in the 21st century, now with Nicki back on Vocals, Andy on guitar, Dave on bass as well as new members Jess Aaron on second guitar and Geza Szent-Galy on drums. The band's first LP was re-released on CD with many extra tracks in 2002.\n\nCurrent members:\n\nNicki Sicki - Vocals (1981-1984, 2005-present)\nDave \"Koko\" Chavez- Bass(1984-1995, 2005-present)\nJess Aaron - Guitar (2005-present)\nGeza Szent-Galy- Drums (2005-present)", "otherInfo": "Ivy Room Presents"}, {"Address": "3600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Bounce!", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433406, 37.764392], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Lookout", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Bounce!\" at Lookout: The elevated location, long windows, and outdoor balcony give this Castro bar its name, where queers nosh on pizza and dance to DJed music while keeping an eye open for people to meet."}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Kode IV", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/146742.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Kode IV is an electro-industrial band formed in Belgium by Hans Schiller and Peter Ziegelmeier.\n\nHans Schiller and Peter Ziegelmeier began releasing rhythmic sample-laden industrial dance as Kode IV on Belgium's KK Records in 1990.

The samples were used not only to create a good dancey track but also a distinct message and theme in each song.

Here\u2019s the story of David Bromberg, or at least some of it . . .\n\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1945 and raised in Tarrytown, NY, \u201cas a kid I listened to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and whatever else was on the radio,\u201d says Bromberg. \u201cI discovered Pete Seeger and The Weavers and, through them, Reverend Gary Davis. I then discovered Big Bill Broonzy, who led me to Muddy Waters and the Chicago blues. This was more or less the same time I discovered Flatt and Scruggs, which led to Bill Monroe and Doc Watson.\u201d\n\nBromberg began studying guitar-playing when he was 13 and eventually enrolled in Columbia University as a musicology major. The call of the Greenwich Village folk scene in the mid-\u201960s drew David to the downtown clubs and coffeehouses, where he could watch and learn from the best performers, including primary sources such as his inspiration and teacher, the Reverend Gary Davis.\n\nBromberg\u2019s sensitive and versatile approach to guitar-playing earned him jobs playing the Village \u201cbasket houses\u201d for tips, the occasional paying gig, and lots of employment as a backing musician for Tom Paxton, Jerry Jeff Walker and Rosalie Sorrels, among others. He became a first-call, \u201chired gun\u201d guitarist for recording sessions, ultimately playing on hundreds of records by artists including Bob Dylan (New Morning, Self Portrait, Dylan), Link Wray, The Eagles, Ringo Starr, Willie Nelson, and Carly Simon.\n\nAn unexpected and wildly successful solo spot at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival in Great Britain led to a solo deal with Columbia Records, for whom David recorded four albums. His eponymous 1971 debut not only included the mock-anguished \u201cSuffer to Sing the Blues,\u201d a Bromberg original that became an FM radio staple, but also \u201cThe Holdup,\u201d a songwriting collaboration with former Beatle George Harrison, whom he met at his manager\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner festivities. Harrison also played slide guitar on the track. Through Bromberg\u2019s manager, Al Aronowitz, David also met the Grateful Dead and wound up with four of their members, including Jerry Garcia, playing on his next two albums.\n\nBromberg\u2019s range of material, based in the folk and blues idioms, continually expanded with each new album to encompass bluegrass, ragtime, country and ethnic music, and his touring band grew apace. By the mid-\u201970s, the David Bromberg Big Band included horn-players, a violinist, and several multi-instrumentalists, including David himself. Among the best-known Bromberg Band graduates: mandolinist Andy Statman, later a major figure in the Klezmer music movement in America, and fiddler Jay Ungar (who wrote the memorable \u201cAshokan Farewell\u201d for Ken Burns\u2019 PBS documentary, \u201cThe Civil War\u201d).\n\nDespite jubilant, loose-limbed concerts and a string of acclaimed albums on the Fantasy label, Bromberg found himself exhausted by the logistics of the music business. \u201cI decided to change the direction of my life,\u201d he explains. So David dissolved his band in 1980, and he and his artist/musician wife, Nancy Josephson, moved from Northern California to Chicago, where David attended the Kenneth Warren School of Violin Making. Though he still toured periodically, the recordings slowed to a trickle and then stopped.\n\nAfter \u201ctoo many Chicago winters,\u201d in 2002 David and Nancy were lured to Wilmington, Del., where they became part of the city\u2019s artist-in-residence program and where David could establish David Bromberg Fine Violins, a retail store and repair shop for high quality instruments. Frequent participation in the city\u2019s weekly jam sessions helped rekindle Bromberg\u2019s desire to make music again, as did the encouragement of fellow musicians Chris Hillman (The Byrds, Desert Rose Band, Flying Burrito Brothers) and bluegrass wizard Herb Pedersen, and David\u2019s manager, Steve Bailey. The jams also led to the formation of Angel Band, fronted by Nancy and two other female vocalists, with David serving as an accompanist.\n\nWith the release of Try Me One More Time, David continues his musical revitalization, playing shows on his own, backed by (and supporting) Angel Band, his own David Bromberg Quartet, and reunions of the David Bromberg Big Band, the configuration depending on the circumstance.

That way if you ever meet Hoj, you can surprise him by pronouncing his name correctly. But we'll hold out a bit longer for dramatic effect. So yes, lots of mischief caused by the 3 letters that are his name. Fitting, because Hoj sets out to create mischief in all his creative endeavors. His music is deep and sexy in a way that encourages crowds to create a little mischief of their own. This sound earned him a night at Berlin's legendary Panorama Bar amongst a slew of other clubs and stages around the world. He was one of the founding members of the Opulent Temple at Burning Man, and in recent years his sets atop the Robot Heart bus have become legendary in their own right. He continues his musical escapades alongside Lee Burridge as a resident for All Day I Dream. And also enjoys a residency with Listed Productions. He is currently based in Los Angeles.

Joe\u2019s memoir, The Man Who Outgrew His Prison Cell, tells the story of how his home life turned brutal until he picked up a steak knife and plunged it into his father\u2019s neck. The book details his subsequent descent into crime, culminating with a 30-bank heist spree and eventual arrest. He ended up in solitary confinement for almost 2 years, where he returned to his boyhood dream of one day becoming a writer. He discovered his voice on the page, and the trajectory of his life was permanently altered.\nAfter his release, He joined the Board of Directors for Walden House, a reentry program. He has conducted writing workshops in reentry facilities and prisons all across California.\nJoe became a talking head on TV, sharing his opinions about crime, culture and religion on CNN, Nightline, CBS News/48 Hours, and Court TV. He even argued with Bill O\u2019Reilly on his TV show, The O\u2019Reilly Factor.\nJoe\u2019s critically acclaimed memoir, The Man Who Outgrew His Prison Cell: Confessions Of A Bank Robber was published in 2004. That same year he began a correspondence with an incarcerated woman. He encouraged her to write about her life. Piper Kerman was eventually released from prison and published one of Joe\u2019s letters in her bestselling memoir, Orange Is the New Black.\nIn 2010, Joe published his award-winning essay Soundtracking A Bank Robbery in McSweeney\u2019s magazine. Film director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) read the essay and contacted Joe to consult on his Baby Driver film script. Joe took the consulting gig, and in 2017 Joe also played the ironic role of a bank guard who gets shot and killed by Jamie Foxx during a harrowing heist getaway.\nJoe has also written for the TV shows Queen of the South and Taken. Joe spends his days preparing to launch Watcha! Media. He\u2019s also toiling to create a coming-of-age TV show about a badass girl who navigates the treacheries of middle school with help from her ex-con father who offers insights into insecure juvenile motivations that he learned from his many years behind bars.\nA 16-episode podcast about Joe\u2019s life adventure, Bank Robber Diaries, produced by Western Sound, launched in November 2019.\n\n\u2764 Reid Mihalko of ReidAboutSex.com, Relationship10x.com, and Sex10xOnline.com helps adults and college students create more self-esteem, self-confidence and greater health and satisfaction in and out of the bedroom using an inspiring mixture of humor, keen insight, and comprehensive sexual health information.\nUsing humor, insight and solid information, Reid appeals to audiences of all orientations, backgrounds, ages, and identities.

The formal, year-long process along with Reid\u2019s apology and resources were shared publicly and can be found at TinyURL.com/reidaccountability.

Before long Derrick became a strong presence in Chicago\u00b4s underground dance scene. \"When I got my driver\u00b4s license at 16 my sneak ability was validated,\" he laughs. \"I was a fierce bedroom jock for a long time. After you mix for the love of it for six or seven years, you get it pretty tight and you can take it on the road.\" Derrick got by working at dance\u2013music specialty stores like Gramaphone and gigging at parties. later Derrick landed regular DJ stints at Shelter, Foxy\u00b4s, and Smart Bar.\n\nThough he doesn\u00b4t spin much locally anymore, when he does he attracts large crowds. Derrick\u00b4s sets are rooted in house, but he freely travels outside club tastes, seamlessly incorporating old\u2013school disco, soul, jazz, and whatever else catches his fancy. Most of the time Derrick works in Europe, where he\u00b4s become a major celebrity among dance\u2013music aficionados. And the money\u00b4s a hell of a lot better there. \"It\u00b4s hard not to laugh on the occasions when you\u00b4ll make 20 times what you make in Chicago on a Saturday night, but here are also times when you do it just for the fun, like at home. So many people come up to me and say, \u00b4Man, I had the worst day. My girlfriend left me, I locked my keys in my car, but you turned me for two hours, and that made me able to get up in the morning.\u00b4 That\u00b4s the best thing going.\"\n\nIn 1988 Derrick, fellow DJ Mark Farina, and friend Chris Nazuka released an EP as the group Symbols & Instruments. The record had a strong influence on the burgeoning ambient techno movement in England. While it wasn\u00b4t a commercial success, it established Derrick as an international figure in the dance\u2013music underground. Since then he\u00b4s been involved with a number of recording projects, firstly his solo project Sound Patrol under whom he released his first album \u00b4Sweetened \u2013No Lemon\u00b4 which exuded a soulfulness and low\u2013key grittiness that resonated beyond the infectious grooves and made a departure from the machine\u2013like quality of the dance music fare of the time.\n\nSince then the pioneering, innovative tracks and consequent critical acclaim have marked Derrick out as one of the most important players in dance music. Most notably through his more recent releases on Classic. His first release was as Rednail with \u00b4I Think of You\u00b4, followed by N? Pschidt and Hope under his own name. N? Pschidt combined woven scatting with sleepy minimal beats on \u00b4Dreaming Again\u00b4 and skilfully cast his own low, sexy drawl over his trademark Carter grooves to form \u00b4Boompty Boomp Theme\u00b4, described by Seven magazine as \u00b4without doubt the slinkiest and downright funkiest track I\u00b4ve heard for a long time.\u00b4 Derrick\u00b4s latest Classic release \u00b4Hope\u00b4 is again causing a storm amongst DJs and press alike and his Classic album is eagerly awaited and expected for release sometime within the next year.\n\nDerrick Carter is most definitely bringing the Boompty Boomp back to the dance floor!\n\nhttp://om-records.com/artists/derrick_carter", "otherInfo": "Online tickets are sold out but there will be plenty of tickets at the door!This is not a drill, y'all.

He\u2019s a platinum-selling artist, he\u2019s topped the charts worldwide as the producer behind Reel 2 Real\u2019s hit \u201cI Like To Move It\u201d (used in both Madagascar movies, reaching millions of viewers worldwide and covered by Will I Am in Madagascar 2) and he\u2019s been responsible for a bewildering array of dance-floor tracks including \u2018Reach\u2019, \u2018Believe\u2019, \u2018Do What You Want\u2019 and \u2018I Feel Love\u2019 - under pseudonyms including Ministers De La Funk, The Dronez (with Harry \u2018Choo Choo\u2019 Romero and Jose Nunez) and Li\u2019l Mo Ying Yang. He\u2019s remixed everyone from Whitney Houston to Basement Jaxx and continues to run the legendary Subliminal Records house music empire. On his debut album he collaborated with Puff Daddy and Boy George alike.\n\nFor over a decade now, Erick has remained one of the most in-demand and instantly recognizable DJs in the world. From the instant success of his weekly \u2018Sessions\u2019 parties in New York, to hosting events like the annual road-blocking Subliminal Sessions parties in Miami at Winter Music Conference, to his coveted residency at Ministry of Sound (he\u2019s still one of the only American DJs to ever hold one) and of course his now legendary Subliminal Sessions parties at Pacha Ibiza, Morillo just doesn\u2019t stop. His non-stop DJing schedule at one point saw him straddling the globe playing up to a whopping 30 gigs a month, particularly in the summer months where he\u2019ll play from Rome and Mykonos to London. He\u2019s also become a familiar television personality through his appearances on MTV and MTV Ibiza two years in a row whilst starring in a seven part series for UK TV station Channel 4.\n\nRaised in Colombia, then New Jersey, Erick was weaned on a musical diet of Latin rhythms, reggae and hip-hop. He started DJing at the age of 11 and after securing himself DJ sets at several local gigs decided to take a studio engineering course at the local Centre of Media Arts. He was soon inducted into the house fraternity through his friend Marc Anthony (the Salsa King), whilst he was working with the now legendary Louie Vega and Kenny \u201cDope\u201d Gonzalez on \u201cRide On The Rhythm\u201d. \u201cLouie\u2019s watched out for me since the beginning,\u201d he says of the Masters At Work legend. One minor detail: in the booth at Pacha last time they played together was a certain supermodel called Naomi Campbell and beside her was one of Erick\u2019s musical heroes, the legendary Quincy Jones. \u201cCan you believe it? Quincy Jones came to my party,\u201d he says, still in shock. \u201cWhen we saw him there, Louie and I decided to play a bunch of his classics, like Michael Jackson\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Til You Get Enough\u2019. He told me he loved my bass lines,\u201d smiles Erick. \u201cOne of the proudest days in my life.\u201d\n\nIn 1997, after spending almost a year of meticulously planning everything from logos to packaging, Morillo took it that one step further and launched Subliminal Records with his production partners Harry Romero and Jose Nunez. Guided by Morillo\u2019s ear and studio presence, the brand has gone on to become synonymous with a funk-fuelled, soulful house sound. And in 2004 Erick released his first artist album worldwide, entitled \u201cMy World\u201d it featured heavyweight collaborations from the likes of Puff Daddy, DJ Rap, Boy George and even a reunion with the Mad Stuntman. The lead single \u2018Break Down The Doors\u2019 featured The Audio Bullys, and in the years that followed, further singles and club tracks followed. After \u2018Live Your Life\u2019 and \u2018Stronger\u2019 came Erick\u2019s collaboration with Skin and Eddie Thonieck, \u201cIf This Ain\u2019t Love\u201d, quickly followed by \u2018Elephant\u2019 featuring Alexandra Burke, a Top 5 UK smash. The global touring continued, as did his dominance at clubs from Pacha Ibiza and Ministry Of Sound in London.\n\nAfter a well-documented break from the scene, Morillo returned to his spiritual home of Ibiza in 2014. But unlike previous seasons, he only took on one show, at Space: \u201cI decided to take a step back and I really got to see the industry changing. I did one party at Space for their 25th birthday, two sets, one outside and then I did the last 4 hours of the terrace, which brought back a bunch of memories! I loved playing and it was a great statement to make.\u201d Fast-forward to the summer of 2015 and things are right where he wants them to be, with Subliminal re-launching in the digital sphere with a whole raft of new ideas and remixes planned for the start of 2016. Tracks like \u2018Welcome To The Jungle\u2019 and \u2018Shiny Disco Balls\u2019 are ripe for remixing, but Erick promises that the focus will remain on the new as much as the classic catalogue. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great music from house to techno \u2013 a little bit of everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be releasing lots of records from different people.\u201d\n\nWith a super-successful summer spent in and out of Space, Ibiza with Luciano\u2019s Cadenza party, as well as key shows from Marquee in New York and LIV in Miami to Avalon in LA and back, Erick is firing on all cylinders. He has several original productions and key collaborations that have now dropped, including \u2018Something For Carl Cox\u2019, a fun techno jam that Erick made for, well, guess who, a searing deep house club track called \u2018The Restorer\u2019 and another with Harry Romero called \u2018Going To LA\u2019. And he also has a solo double-header dropping on Subliminal Records in November 2015. \u201cI\u2019m releasing a two part EP titled Limitless which will consist of a track titled \u2018I Want You\u2019 followed by \u2018Trapped\u2019 - both great records,\u201d he nods. And the label is also gearing up for some major moves at the start of 2016. A-List artists such as Kolsch and The Martinez Brothers will be remixing the very best of the classic catalogue. Erick, meanwhile, is happy to be living in LA. \u201cLA is the place to be, not just because the record industry is there but also the artists. It\u2019s a great place to be and a great place to network. I want to be in the mix!\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "314 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Steve Darko", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9957574.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413904, 37.771448], "Date": "Sat Feb 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-22", "Genre": "Genres: house, techno", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Halcyon SF", "moreBioInfo": "Steve Darko is one of the latest up-and-coming producers championing the underground house scene.

JusJames (James McClelland) is a hardworking, innovative Christian artist rising from the city Sacramento, CA. Since 2005, James has been creating, composing, and performing songs that many would describe as life changing and impactful. James was born on June 24, 1984 in Mather, CA to Edward & Myong McClelland. As early as age 4, James can remember being in church while his Mom would serve within the community. James would eventually grow a fond relationship with music and begin creating custom mixtapes, in which, he would display with his friends and fellow classmates. He also became heavily involved in sports which includes a 4-year letterman in Football. Even with the accolades of Football under his belt, he began to stray away from the teachings and doctrines he had learned in church and began to experience the party life and all that comes with it.\n\nIn 2005, he realized he had an ability to write and compose music and began to pursue a recreational career in doing so. The following year, James spent an entire year and a half period working diligently in the studio recording song after song which ultimately resulted in the release of his first studio album entitled \"WWJD (What Would James Do?)\". The biggest highlight for him that year was marrying his wife, Alicia Renee Hernandez. She had a daughter, Eyvonne, from a previous relationship and the two began a life together as a family. In the same year, James spent a large amount of time collaborating with Madd Life Entertainment where he began performing at numerous venues and building his brand as an artist in the local Sacramento area. However in 2008, James\u2019 life and music career took an unexpected turn for the better. James received Christ as his personal Savior and put his musical endeavors on halt for a while.\n\nIn the year 2010, James returned to music with the same impressive talents and gifts but with a new mission to minister music rather than perform it\u2026 music that glorified God, not self. From that point on, he has released 3 mixtapes and 2 albums representing his mission and his new image. He currently works collaboratively with other artists with the same mission!\n\nJames & his Wife, Alicia Renee currently serve at The Door CFC of Land Park in Sacramento, CA", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4627 CA-1, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "Kate Gaffney", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8682343.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.498417, 37.604139], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Groove, Roots, Rock", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Pacifica Brewery", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-songwriter Kate Gaffney honed her skills in her native Philadelphia, jumped from coast to coast, and laid musical roots in Northern California.\n\nThe exploration of coastal living, in all of its glory, splendor, isolation, and mystery, has inspired Kate to make a new concept album - coming soon!", "otherInfo": "Sunday afternoon on the outdoor stage!\n\n12 noon- 2:30pm\n\nFamily-friendly\nNo cover"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "DJ Jamy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9973807.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Second Life - .Oooze @.GIN City - Sensation Sundays", "moreBioInfo": "SecondLife and Real World DJ", "otherInfo": "http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Moon Bright/108/128/1240"}, {"Address": "1974 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Versoul", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10032068.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.268792, 37.87262], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, soul, Rap, Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Spats Berkeley", "moreBioInfo": "Versoul is an alternative hip-hop artist, producer and sound engineer born in San Francisco and raised throughout the Bay Area.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Jock", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433406, 37.764392], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Lookout", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Jock\" at Lookout: The elevated location, long windows, and outdoor balcony give this Castro bar its name, where queers nosh on pizza and dance to DJed music while keeping an eye open for people to meet."}, {"Address": "1801 E Cotati Ave, Rohnert Park, CA 94928", "Artist": "Catalyst Quartet", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7869514.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.673536, 38.340121], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: String Quartet", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Green Music Center", "moreBioInfo": "Hailed by the New York Times at their Carnegie Hall debut as \u201cinvariably energetic and finely burnished\u2026 playing with earthy vigor\u201d the Catalyst Quartet, prize winners of the Gianni Bergamo Classical Music Award 2012 (Switzerland) is comprised of top Laureates and alumni of the internationally acclaimed Sphinx Competition.

He began co-writing and recording and producing with the New Jersey based band Dog Show Blues. During this time he also worked on what would later become his debut album. Attributing much of his inspiration to his three older brothers, he named the solo project The Fourth Son. His debut album The Fourth Son EP was released in 2014. In the winter of 2015, The Fourth Son relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, and began developing a live presence. He played at open-mic nights throughout the Bay Area, while teaching elementary physical education by day. He released his second album titled Lavenia in 2016. With an increasing number of tour dates the project has developed a unique and powerful live sound.

Penelope Houston was the lead singer, primary songwriter, and her persona was a large part of the draw for the act. The other band members were James Wilsey (bass), D. Furious (drums), and Greg Ingraham (guitar). Critic Greil Marcus once said The Avengers were, \"...San Francisco's best punk band - in their moments, they were, you knew, better than any other band playing that night anywhere in the world.\"\n\nThe Avengers gained much publicity when they opened for the Sex Pistols in San Francisco, for their legendary final show at Winterland. The Avengers' 4-song EP was also produced by Steve Jones (of the Sex Pistols) in 1979 on White Noise Records.\n\nTheir discography also contains an earlier 3-song EP (on Dangerhouse Records) from 1977, a full album called \"The Avengers\" from 1981, a compilation of unreleased tracks and outtakes called \"The Avengers Died for Your Sins\" in 1999 on Lookout! Records, and a second compilation titled \"The American in Me\" on DBK Works (2004). Houston and Ingraham have reunited and currently perform as The Avengers with bassist Joel Reader (MXT, Pansy Division) and drummer Luis Illades (Pansy Division) touring the US and Europe.\n\n2.\nPerhaps the first band to be called The Avengers was an American group from Bakersfield, California. The first incarnation came together in 1964, as a surf six-piece. Where the name came from is unknown, but the hip British TV series 'The Avengers' had started running on the BBC two years earlier. The group soon latched on to the new sound of the British Invasion and bands like The Beatles, but also American acts like Paul Revere & the Raiders and The Music Machine. Between 1965 and 1967 The Avengers released five 45s and played support slots for the likes of The Beach Boys, The Animals, The Seeds and The Music Machine. They didn't have a hit, but their song \"Be a Caveman\" has become legendary in garage circuits for having the sort of lyric you'd think everyone would write but never really did. Other songs that have turned up on garage compilations are \"It's Hard to Hide\" and its b-side \"Open Your Eyes\". The Avengers had unusually short hair, because they were still in school and were afraid to get suspended.\n\n3.\nAnother early band named The Avengers were based in Wellington, New Zealand and were active from 1966 until 1969. They had a string of top ten hits on the New Zealand charts, with the most successful, \"Love, Hate, Revenge\", reaching #2 in August 1968. Overseas, however, they had considerably less success and they broke up after their second tour of Australia. During their career, they released two albums, Electric Recording in 1968 and Medallion in 1969, as well as a live album in 1968. In 2001, almost all of their studio material was collected on one compilation that also appeared under the name Electric Recording.", "otherInfo": "T.S.O.L."}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Kicker", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Jill Drew and Phil Sutton (Comet Gain and Velocette) started UK band Kicker in 1998, releasing their first single in 1999, on the Rough Trade Shop imprint ForUs.

The band initially were recognized for a fast, fierce unrelenting sound, but later blended the onslaught with lighter more comedic fare. They were also unique in frequently changing their name with every new record released. Acronyms using the same three initials included Millions of Dead Cops, More Dead Cops, Millions of Dead Children, Multi Death Corporations, Millions of Damn Christians and Missile Destroyed Civilization.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Texas was one of the breeding grounds for a new kind of punk music known as 'hardcore punk'. The three bands in Austin who pioneered this new sound were Dicks, Big Boys and MDC, who were known at this early stage as The Stains. These bands frequently played together and established the hardcore scene in that city. By 1982 MDC relocated to San Francisco, California - a city and state that had a very vibrant underground music scene. They re-released the single under the Stains name as an MDC recording featuring the key track John Wayne Was a Nazi. By this point the band were active and leading participants in the growing D.I.Y american hardcore scene, and their debut LP Millions Of Dead Cops was released on the band's own label, R Radical. The album which sold tens of thousands of copies annually for years is now widely considered a punk classic, and featured songs such as \"John Wayne Was A Nazi\", \"Dick for Brains\" and the harsh criticique of police violence, \"I Remember\". Other targets included factory farming and capitalism (\"Corporate Death Burger\"), homophobia and American culture ( My Family Is Just A Little Weird\",\"Violent Rednecks\") , all criticized at breakneck speed without irony, by the band. Playing fast, left-wing punk earned the band close association with San Francisco's Jello Biafra and the Dead Kennedys, with whom they toured with on the Rock Against Reagan caravan. The group also had the respect of numerous other punk band peers of the early eighties including Crass, D.O.A., False Prophets, Butthole Surfers, D.R.I. and numerous others who appeared on the group's landmark set \"War/Peace\" DBL LP compilation album. For a time after Operation Ivy disbanded Rancid's Matt Freeman was a bassist and Tim Armstrong, a roadie. MDC's outspoken views also made them enemies, including racist white skinheads, cops and even black reggae punk group The Bad Brains all whom took offense at the band's opinionated lyrics at one time or another.\n\nThe importance, and prominence, of MDC as an influential hardcore band dwindled by the late eighties when singer Dave and drummer Al Schvitz were the only original members. The lack of new recorded material and live performances after 1993, plus personal & drug problems including prison time, led to an informal break-up of the band. After release from a stint in prison, MDC's singer, Dave Dictor, did return with an entirely new backing line-up in 2000 in NYC, and MDC, now based out of Portland Oregon played a 25th anniversary world tour in 2005, with an all-original lineup including guitarist Ex-Con Ron and 1st LP bassist Mikey Offender (aka Mikey Donaldson before his death in 2006). MDC still tours some 30 years since their debut with Dave & Al and a rotating cast of characters.", "otherInfo": "T.S.O.L. with The Avengers, M.D.C., The Lewd and Kicker"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109-5519", "Artist": "Alter Bridge", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9168121.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Metal, Hard Rock, Rock", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Heroes push us to excel. Their will, courage, and sacrifice can bring out the best in the world around them.\n\nFittingly, on their fifth full-length album, The Last Hero, hard rock juggernaut Alter Bridge pursue a level of excellence inspired by timeless heroism. Making the record became something of a personal quest for the quartet\u2014Myles Kennedy [vocals, guitar], Mark Tremonti [guitar, vocals], Brian Marshall [bass], and Scott Phillips [drums]. In 2013, the band reached an elevated creative and critical milestone with Fortress. It bowed at #12 on the Billboard Top 200, moving over 30,000 copies first-week and earning unanimous tastemaker praise. The record garnered perfect scores from Total Guitar and KERRANG! as well as acclaim from Billboard, The Guardian, Loudwire, Ultimate Guitar, and many more. In between sold out tours in Europe and North America, the guys appeared on VH1 and graced the cover of Classic Rock Magazine who labeled Fortress, \u201cThe best thing they\u2019ve ever done,\u201d while Eddie Trunk called it, \u201cA top 10 album of the last 10 years.\u201d When it came time to write new music, the musicians collectively raised the bar yet again.\n\n\u201cEvery time we do a record, my only goal is for people to simply think it\u2019s better than the previous one,\u201d declares Mark. \u201cWe pushed ourselves so hard last time, and we knew were going to push ourselves much harder here. When we brought material in, it had to outdo Fortress.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always strive for that,\u201d agrees Myles. \u201cWhile recognizing where we\u2019ve come from, we wanted to expand what Alter Bridge is. This record is definitely an exploration of the hero theme\u2014whether it be the lack of heroes, the need for heroes, or a tribute to heroes. There\u2019s a story in there.\u201d\n\nMyles wrapped up touring with Slash, and Mark finished up a successful run supporting his second solo album Cauterize in late 2015. By January 2016, the four members congregated back in Orlando with longtime producer Michael \u201cElvis\u201d Baskette [Slash, Trivium]. Over the next four months, they diligently assembled and tracked the 13 songs comprising The Last Hero.\n\n\u201cBecause we have very finite windows of time to put these records together, it\u2019s nonstop when we regroup,\u201d explains Myles. \u201cEach writer is very involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d work all day in the studio, and Myles and I would go back to my house and come up with ideas all night,\u201d recalls Mark. \u201cWe set up camp in my kids\u2019 playroom with a Garage Band system to prepare for the next day. It was intense.\u201d\n\nConstantly progressing, the boys decided to employ some fresh techniques, utilize more alternate tunings and even recorded on a seven-string guitar for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put out the same thing over and over again,\u201d Tremonti continues. \u201cWe want to keep everyone guessing. There are three new tunings, and that helped keep us inspired. I\u2019d never recorded on a seven-string until now. This is the first record where Myles planned out his solos beforehand. In the past, he would wing it with this magical, improvisational touch. What he did is amazing. Me and Slash have both said he\u2019s the best guitar player in our bands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t afraid to travel certain roads we might\u2019ve been hesitant to venture down on the last two albums,\u201d adds Myles. \u201cAs a result, some of the songs are more uplifting and melodic. There was certainly a psychological shift. We embraced the past. You hear elements of each record throughout our history.\u201d\n\nThe Last Hero opens with the urgent, untamed, and undeniable \u201cShow Me A Leader.\u201d Following an intricate clean intro, the song gallops into a rapturous chant punctuated by fierce and fiery seven-string shredding. It\u2019s a clarion call for the next phase of Alter Bridge.\n\n\u201cLyrically, it definitely reflects the frustration a lot of people are feeling with the current state of the world,\u201d admits Myles. \u201cThe world is looking for trustworthy effective leadership and not this undignified dog and pony show that\u2019s really made a mockery of our system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indicative of our process,\u201d Mark goes on. \u201cMyles had this guitar intro that I loved, and I had the chorus. We put them together. The words call out for a proper leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Champion\u201d climbs from a swell of delay into an impressive guitar lick before Myles delivers one of the most spirited choruses of their career to date. \u201cThe lyric was actually inspired by thinking back to my situation as a kid,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was this really small, underdeveloped kid who had to work extremely hard to keep up with all of my peers. It was very frustrating. I would hear a lot of words of encouragement from parents, coaches, or teachers though. A lot of those things were stored away, and they manifested themselves in this song. I\u2019ve been able to apply some of those concepts in my life a thousand times over since then.\u201d\n\nThen, there\u2019s \u201cPoison in Your Veins,\u201d which channels an airy refrain through a whirlwind of guitar Sturm und Drang. \u201cThis song showcases the inner dialogue in one\u2019s head; serving as reminder to live life courageously, take chances, and ultimately believe in yourself. It\u2019s not a new theme for us, but definitely one that can never be overstated,\" explains Myles.\n\nTremonti adds: \u201cWe wanted to make it as musically interesting as possible, while preserving a hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cLosing Patience\u201d tempers a bombastic drum groove with an ominous and poignant proclamation, while the ballad \u201cYou Will Be Remembered\u201d evinces another side of the sound. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to heroes like anybody who\u2019s served the country or community,\u201d Myles remarks. \u201cThe song touches on the ultimate sacrifice soldiers, police, and firemen are willing to give.\u201d\n\nNearing seven minutes, the title track and finale ebbs and flows between hypnotic heaviness and an instrumental elegance that\u2019s cinematic in scope. \u201cThat\u2019s probably my favorite track,\u201d he states. \u201cWhether it\u2019s today, 100 years ago, or 1,000 years ago, being a human on this planet is never easy. We\u2019re going through a lot. The need for heroes, positive influences, and good leadership is obvious, but we definitely need it right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cFans love the epic side of Alter Bridge,\u201d Mark says. \u201cWe tried to stretch the boundaries again. The arrangement isn\u2019t typical at all. It\u2019s an important moment for the record.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Alter Bridge heroically deliver for fans worldwide and rock music at large.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back in the Alter Bridge battle,\u201d Myles leaves off. \u201cEvery time we do a record, I\u2019m reminded of how great it is to have this passionate and loyal audience. We don\u2019t take it lightly. We consider it an honor that people let us into their lives that way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "The Lewd", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/299341.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Punk", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Lewd was an US West coast punk band active throughout 1978-1982, the Lewd originated in Seattle in the late 1970's, then migrated south to San Francisco where they gained critical acclaim.

She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins.

That same year, Warfield\u2019s performance closing out Essence Fest was hailed as one of the most memorable after shows at the New Orleans House of Blues. In 2015, the accolades only kept growing, with Warfield and the NPG Hornz being named one of the top 10 bands to see at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. It\u2019s no wonder she has left celebrities like Letterman declaring it\u2019s time to \u201ccancel show business!\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Warfield began the next phase of her ascension, collaborating with another one of her childhood influences, the aforementioned Nancy Wilson, to create the band Roadcase Royale.

In his late teens he encountered the early recordings of Stevie Ray Vaughan and was floored by the virtuosity. While in college in 1987 he saw Vaughan perform and he returned to the guitar with a new outlook and resolve.\nHe than began his ascent to masterful blues rock guitarist at age 27, with his first public performance on guitar. Soon he was on the Northeast blues circuit with his band, Swamp Yankee. In 1998 he walked into a Northeast Blues Society open jam, which led to Cummings\u2019 winning the right to compete in the Blues Foundation\u2019s 1999 International Blues Challenge. The following year Albert released his debut recording, The Long Way. Bluesprint magazine said it was \u201ca barrage of guitar pyrotechnics that calls to mind a grand mix of the styles of past masters like Albert King, Freddie King, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimmie Hendrix.\u201d\nThat in turn opened up an opportunity for him to work with Double Trouble, the late Stevie Ray Vaughan\u2019s rhythm section. So taken with Albert\u2019s fire and passion were bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Chris Layton that they volunteered to play on and produce his solo debut recording, 2003\u2019s self-released From the Heart. Recorded in Austin, Texas, it featured Cummings fronting Double Trouble (including Reese Winans) in their first recording project since Stevie Ray\u2019s passing. No less a giant of the blues than B.B. King dubbed Cummings \u201ca great guitarist.\u201d\nCummings' soulful and explosive approach to blues and rock caught the attention of Blind Pig Records, which signed him to a multi-album deal. On his label debut, True to Yourself, released in 2004, Cummings was again joined by bassist Tommy Shannon. Recorded by producer extraordinaire Jim Gaines (Santana, Stevie Ray, Buddy Guy), the album rocks hard from start to finish. The all-original release showcased Albert\u2019s rapidly developing songwriting chops and deeply emotional vocals as well as stunning guitar pyrotechnics, leading Guitar One to exclaim, \"He attacks his axe with unbridled ferocity and deep soulfulness... his depth and expression are matched only by his terrifying technique and tone.\"\nSoon tours and shows with blues legends B.B. King, Johnny Winter, Buddy Guy and others brought Albert\u2019s music to a much larger audience.\nHis second release, Working Man (2006), also produced by Jim Gaines, betrays a growing focus and maturity both in Albert's stinging, incisive guitar work as well as in his fluently idiomatic songwriting. From the punchy, stomping cover of Merle Haggard\u2019s blue collar standard \u201cWorking Man Blues\u201d to the deeply emotive ballad \u201cLast Dance\u201d that closes the disc, Albert\u2019s songs are always concise and direct, driven by his uniquely muscular yet polished guitar wizardry. Billboard said, \"This recording is the calling card of a blues star who has arrived. Cummings' guitar work is sizzling. This is one of the top blues albums of 2006.\"\nIn 2008 Albert recorded his first live album, Feel So Good, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts at the historic Colonial Theatre, a 95-year-old \u201clittle jewel box\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s what James Taylor calls it \u2013 that\u2019s hosted everyone from Will Rogers to Al Jolson. The audience was so enthralled and supportive they became part of the performance in a way that's rarely heard. As AllMusic put it, \"It sounds like it was one hell of a party that night.\"\nAlbert and his band responded with a blistering set of great originals and killer covers of Zeppelin, Little Feat and Muddy Waters tunes. With producer Jim Gaines again at the controls and Albert's incredible display of guitar virtuosity and deep emotion, this is one live performance that is bound to become a blues rock classic.\nGuitar Edge magazine said, \"The blues is best served up live, with an enthusiastic audience and a killin' band, and that's exactly what guitarist Albert Cummings does on his new Feel So Good. Cummings effortlessly shifts from chimney subdued stylings to raucous roadhouse raunch to soaring yet stinging lead lines, driving his audience to frenzy in all the right places.\"\nMusic Connection called it \"one of the best live albums recorded in a long time\" and Blurt added, \"Cummings' first live album provides the perfect showcase for the fiery guitarist's axe-handling skills and enormous onstage charisma.\"\nIn 2011 Albert released an instructional DVD for the Hal Leonard Corporation entitled Working Man Blues Guitar. Cummings\u2019 next CD, No Regrets, was self-released in 2012. It was a return to his true musical roots for the six-string virtuoso, poignantly capturing the core of his influences, displaying the impact that R&B, Rock, Soul, Country and the Blues have had on both his playing and writing. It debuted at #1 on iTunes music charts in the USA, Canada and France.\nFor his latest recording, Someone Like You, Albert chose to record in Southern California with Grammy-winning producer David Z. (Buddy Guy, Prince, Jonny Lang, Gov't Mule) at the helm. Said Z, \u201cAlbert Cummings writes, plays and sings the blues like nobody else. What a blast to watch him jell in the studio with some of the best musicians in Los Angeles.\u201d One of those musicians was Blind Pig label mate and leader of The Basic Cable Band on the Conan TV show, Jimmy Vivino, who performs on three cuts. Cummings said, \"I'm tremendously excited about this CD and the team of people that will be working this record. It was such a pleasure to also work with David Z and Jimmy Vivino and so exciting to share their excitement about the potential this record has.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2344 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Bigtop", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/286448.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.434294, 37.763629], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Beaux", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Big Top\" at Beaux:"}, {"Address": "2470 San Bruno Ave, San Francisco, CA 94134", "Artist": "Nelson Kanzela", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.405199, 37.730685], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "El Toro Night Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1151 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Throwbacks", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6310751.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408767, 37.775679], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Pop Punk, Progressive Punk, Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Raven Bar", "moreBioInfo": "We're Throwbacks out of Brick, NJ.

The album, which will be released by Blue \u00c9lan Records on September 13, reframes 12 songs curated from the Creedence Clearwater Revival leader\u2019s catalog in Magness\u2019 soaring, soul-centered style. It also places her within the lineage of classic singers who have made albums devoted to exploring the work of a single writer within the Great American Songbook\u2014a process that has yielded such historic recordings as Sarah Vaughan Sings George Gershwin and Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook.\nThat comparison may sound like hyperbole until you hear how creatively Magness, who again collaborated with Grammy-nominated producer Dave Darling to make her fifteenth album, explores these songs, from the familiar Creedence hits \u201cLodi\u201d and \u201cBad Moon Rising\u201d to numbers from Fogerty\u2019s solo career, like the title cut and \u201cDon\u2019t You Wish It Was True,\u201d which appears here as a duet with triple-Grammy-winner and American music icon Taj Mahal. And, of course, Fogerty\u2019s work is timeless. His songs have been part of the soundtrack of the lives of multiple generations, cutting a broad swath through rock, blues, and country, and trailblazing the eclectic, roots-based Americana genre.\n\nMagness first opened the door to Change in the Weather: Janiva Magness Sings John Fogerty when she decided to include a passionate version of Fogerty\u2019s gospel-fueled \u201cLong As I Can See the Light\u201d on 2016\u2019s Grammy-nominated Love Wins Again. That album continued her own emergence as a songwriter, which began with 2014\u2019s Original and came into full bloom with 2018\u2019s Love Is an Army. The latter was a brilliantly crafted bridge between the past and present, blending echoes of classic soul and Americana music with enduring themes of love and the contemporary sounds of protest. It followed a 2017 EP, Blue Again, on which Magness, who has won seven Blues Music Awards including Entertainer of the Year, and received 28 nominations, returned to her roots with a collection of songs from that genre\u2019s back pages.\n\n\u201cKirk Pasich, the founder of Blue \u00c9lan, suggested that we record \u2018Long As I Can See the Light,\u2019\u201d Magness explains, \u201cand I loved adapting and singing that song, so it was a natural evolution to Change in the Weather. John Fogerty is a brilliant writer. His melodies are big and rich and provide a real highway into the heart of his songs, which is wonderful for me as a singer, and their backbone is his storytelling, which is spare and direct, and absolutely American in its imagery and themes. And those themes endure.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of the lyrics of his early material were protest-oriented, and that\u2019s important to me\u2014to be speaking out about the current state of affairs in our country and the world. So, songs he wrote in the late \u201960s and early \u201970s, like \u2018Bad Moon Rising\u2019 and \u2018Wrote a Song for Everyone,\u2019 which talk about welfare lines and turbulent times ahead, are still relevant.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Change in the Weather: Janiva Magness Sings John Fogerty perfectly balances challenging realities with joyful buoyancy. \u201cDon\u2019t You Wish It Was True\u201d exudes that balance. The song, which originally appeared on Fogerty\u2019s 2007 solo album Revival, gets righteous bounce from a happy-go-lucky shuffle beat, loping and sliding guitar, and the bright vocal interplay of Mahal and Magness. Mahal, who began his influential career in 1964, has been Grammy- nominated 11 times, and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Americana Music Association in 2014, sings like a gravel-throated Santa from the Mississippi Delta, adding cheerful asides to the tune\u2019s utopian vision. And if anything, one of the album\u2019s themes is its musical diversity. \u201cChange in the Weather,\u201d for example, gets a tent-revival treatment, with Magness\u2019 spirited testifying, handclapped rhythmic accents, and devilish bursts of dirty guitar.\n\nOn \u201cLodi,\u201d which is reimagined here as a blues-rock workout with a nod to Memphis soul, Magness is joined by Los Angeles-based outlaw country singer-songwriter Sam Morrow. Once again, their voices are a contrast of sandpaper and honey that blends to elevate the song\u2019s classic chorus. And the Creedence rock ballad \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain\u201d is slowed to the pace of a lazy river, providing Magness a showcase for elegant phrasing and stirring dynamics that elevates the song\u2019s deep emotionalism into something even more delicate and lovely than the original.\n\nThroughout, producer Darling draws a perfectly tight and raw ensemble sound from the band: Magness\u2019 current touring group of drummer Steve Wilson, bassist Gary Davenport and guitarist Zachary Ross.\n\u201cOne of the things I love about this album is that people already connect with so many of these songs,\u201d Magness observes. \u201cI connect with these songs. And for me, connecting with people is one of the reasons I love to sing ... I have to sing. I know we\u2019re really all part of one big community and, at the heart of everything that unites and divides us, we still have so much in common and so much that we can share. If music like this can bring us all together a little more, then I\u2019m more than happy to be a vehicle for it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Magness is already in the midst of a creative roll, releasing an album annually and touring the world, 2019 promises to be another banner year. In addition to creating Change in the Weather: Janiva Magness Sings John Fogerty, her memoir, Weeds Like Us, will be published in June. Magness fought some tough battles before she launched her career. She lost both parents to suicide as a child and was placed in a dozen foster homes. But, inspired by the encouragement of her final foster mother and a galvanizing performance by the legendary bluesman Otis Rush, she found stability and salvation\u2014and, ultimately, triumph\u2014in music.\n\nSince the early \u201990s, Magness has built an impressive career in American roots music, brick by hard-earned brick. She has traveled millions of miles, sung on thousands of club and festival stages, and made a string of recordings that have earned accolades and awards. Today, her albums rise to the top of Billboard\u2019s roots music charts and the apex of the Americana and blues radio charts. She is only the second woman, following blues giant Koko Taylor, to receive the Blues Foundation\u2019s B.B. King Entertainer of the Year award, and it was presented to her at the Memphis ceremonies by King and Bonnie Raitt. As anyone who has seen her performances or listened to her albums will attest, Magness has, indeed, earned a place in the history of American music.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to separate my life from my artist\u2019s life,\u201d says Magness. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get lost in the work and the devotion of being an artist\u2014of trying to give as much of myself as I can to the people I sing to and to the songs themselves, whether I\u2019ve written them or they\u2019re the songs on Change in the Weather. But there\u2019s one thing I know that is the absolute truth: Everything about me isn\u2019t necessarily what you\u2019ll hear on a record or see on a stage, yet everything about me that\u2019s on an album or on a stage is real, every time.\u201d", "otherInfo": "On the heels of both her 15 th album release, and highly anticipated memoir, Janiva Magness shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nWith her new Change in the Weather: Janiva Magness Sings John Fogerty, the Grammy-nominated artist is at the nexus of re-invention and tradition.

Sometimes a song can be a mirror to the world, or to the hidden selves we are or want to be. Lily Kershaw's debut album, Midnight In The Garden, explores emotional landscapes and heart clutching melodies that say the unsaid things we struggle to say ourselves. The album takes root in the titans of folk music\u2026those classic songsmiths who weave tapestries of sound with fingerpicking and tales of often unspoken truths. In song, Kershaw is an old soul, but in person, she's a kinetic 22 year-old, a \"nearly life-long Los Angeleno,\" she says. She's ebullient and lively, quick with a joke and an infectious smile. Raised adjacent to the Hollywood machine, Kershaw offers an antidote to the long-mythologized Los Angeles glitz; she's authentic, and honest, self-effacing and, above all, she is herself. She may not tell you this, but she's conduit, a nexus of the experiences of the world around her. She feels the weight of the world, she says, but through song, she wears it as an emblem of who she is. Like the day-glow dreams of Los Angeles noir, she reveals the darkness that coexists with sunshine. \"It's all about death,\" she laughs, while describing her music. \"I\u2019d love to say most of my music isn't about death or heartbreak but, well, it is.\" It comes as no surprise then, that in 2012, her single \"As It Seems\" provided the backdrop to the long-running CBS drama series, Criminal Minds. Her voice lilts and flows, as the guitar leans gently into minor keys, and she sings: Well I knew what I didn't want to know, and I saw where I didn't want to go, So I took the path less travelled on, And I\u2019ll let my stories be whispered when I'm gone. The song caught fire, broadcast around the world. \"People wrote to me saying, 'This is the song I want to play at my funeral,' it was unsettling at first,\" she says, \"but it felt good to know that my song connects with people.\" Almost a year later, her song \"Ashes Like Snow\" appeared on the show with similar effect, wrapping audiences up in the meandering piano and her skyward arcing vocals. It was a song born from serendipity, nearly ten years in the making. \"One day when I was at my parents house,\" she says \"I found this poem that I had written right at the time of the September 11 attacks, when I was just a young kid. I took some of those words and added the perspective from where we are today, in the long aftermath of war and struggle, looking back.\" Kershaw is a compulsive creator, she jots down melodies and lyrics as she's wandering through her days. She sings melodies into her phone while sitting in traffic or secretly hums a tune into a voice recorder while out at shows, capturing any inspiration that she can channel back into her music. Her debut layers lush instrumentation over the stark skeleton of her sketches, sauntering between swaying somberness and playful uplifting anthems. Like the subtle beauty of a black rose, Kershaw's music shores melancholy with a sense of hope and catharsis. And like she sings, her stories -- her songs -- are whispers or echoes, messages in bottles, cast out into the world. Midnight In The Garden is set for release in September 2013 via Nettwerk Records.

As a singer, songwriter, and activist, Victoria Canal\u2019s voice powers a growing discography of alternative pop anthems as well as myriad of social causes.\nSince her emergence in 2015, the songstress has quietly impacted both culture and music, chronicled by CNN Espa\u00f1ol in a one-hour special entitled Proyecto ser Humano. She would also be tapped by Michael Franti for a marathon of touring, enlisted by Nike as a rep and model for the FlyEase Air Jordan 1 designed for adaptive athletes, and streamed more than 10 million times to date.\nMost importantly though, she confidently shares this power with the world at large.\n\u201cWhen you listen to me, I want you to feel like you can be heard,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat goes for music and activism. In the activist work I do, I hope more people feel empowered. Diversity and representation really matter to me across the board with everything.\u201d\nBorn in Munich, Canal\u2019s international upbringing positioned her to speak on a global platform. Her American mother and Spanish father pledged to travel the world together and raise their children around the globe. A proud \u201cthird culture kid,\u201d she lived everywhere from Shanghai, Tokyo, Amsterdam, London, and Dubai to Atlanta, New York, and Forth Worth.\nIt was in Atlanta that she really recognized the power of music as \u201cthe ultimate bonding language\u201d though. Her maternal grandmother worked as a piano teacher and musical director at the local church, and welcomed a young Victoria to accompany the choir in her home. By the time the family moved to Dubai at 13-years-old, she refined her skills on piano and started writing songs under the influence of John Mayer, Stevie Wonder, Bon Iver, Ben Howard, and Queen, to name a few. Following a year in Barcelona, she enrolled in a conservatory and online school. Her senior year consisted of a transformative five-month backpacking trip where she traveled and volunteered around Australia, Fiji, and New Zealand.\nSettling back in the States near her grandparents, she developed a creative partnership with legendary vocal coach Jan Smith [Drake, Usher], who produced Canal\u2019s Into The Pull EP in 2016. The partnership later yielded \u201cCity Shoes,\u201d which amassed 7.5 million Spotify streams as of 2019.\nIn the aftermath of that release, Canal took a year-long detour as a freshman at New York University\u2019s prestigious Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. At the end of the second semester, Michael Franti serendipitously invited her on tour via Instagram message. Building a profile, she went on to grace hallowed stages such as Red Rocks Amphitheater, the Apollo, and The Kennedy Center in addition to supporting Lawrence, Emily King, and Mac Ayres, among others.\nImpressively, she managed to do all of this having been born with one arm as a result of Amniotic Band Syndrome. The LGBTQ, Spanish-American, and differently-abled songstress draws on an impassioned positivity.\n\u201cMy family never treated me like I was weird,\u201d she says. \u201cMy arm was always just called my \u2018Little arm\u2019. That was it. They made me feel like I could do anything I wanted to and to believe in my dreams. On my dad\u2019s side, my grandma would always tell me this Spanish saying that translates to \u2018Optimism orients the hand of destiny\u2019. My family just has this energy where everything is going to be fine. It\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\nThis energy courses through the music as well. Teaming up with collaborator Martin Luke Brown, her forthcoming 2020 EP emanates boundless confidence with her inspiring take on pop music, beginning with the lead single \u201cDrama\u201d. Backed by an unshakable groove and sparse synths, the track offers up a message of reassurance amplified through Canal\u2019s dynamic vocals.\n\u201cIt really came to be about letting go of people\u2019s opinions, including and especially my own inner critic,\u201d she remarks. \u201cDrama is all about embracing my highest self\u2014no matter what anybody might be trying to make me feel. I can brush that shit off and live my best life.\u201d\nAt the same time, Canal manages to make a difference at every turn through consistently giving back as a humanitarian and sought-after speaker. Internally and externally, her motivational speeches encouraged diversity amongst corporations such as Toyota, Mastercard, TED, and more. She has appeared in campaigns for health-centric brands including Soylent and Rebbl. Plus, she successfully galvanized fundraising efforts for Garden of Dreams Foundations, Thankful.org, Operation Smile, and Autism Speaks.\nAdditionally, Unrealistic Ideas\u2014the production company founded by Academy\u00ae Award-nominated superstar Mark Wahlberg\u2014will document her journey in an upcoming series.\n\u201cI played my first fundraiser in fifth grade, and it felt so good,\u201d she smiles. \u201cI never stopped. To be included and treated equally is a total privilege. Giving back is super important to me.\u201d\nIn the end, Victoria\u2019s voice illuminates the fact that anything is possible.\n\u201cI\u2019m growing a lot as an artist and as a person,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI want to share that you\u2019re not alone in what you go through and you can achieve anything. I hope to be an example of that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2087 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Phillip Greenlief", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8914956.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.268704, 37.871272], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "Genres: Improvised Music New Music, Noise, Avant Gard", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "California Jazz Conservatory", "moreBioInfo": "Since his emergence on the west coast in the late 1970s, Evander Music founder and saxophonist Phillip Greenlief has achieved international critical acclaim for his recordings and performances with musicians and composers in the post-jazz continuum as well as new music innovators and virtuosic improvisers.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Phillip Greenlief/Fred Frith/Scott Amendola trio @ CJC Rendon Hall . All Ages!

Keep on, Tom!\u201d\n\nGuy Clark adds: \u201cThirty years ago Tom Paxton taught a generation of traditional folksingers that it was noble to write your own songs, and, like a good guitar, he just gets better with age.\u201d Paxton has been an integral part of the songwriting and folk music community since the early 60\u2019s Greenwich Village scene, and continues to be a primary influence on today\u2019s \u201cNew Folk\u201d performers. The Chicago native came to New York via Oklahoma, which he considers to be his home state. His family moved there in 1948, when Tom was 10 years old, and he graduated from Bristow High School and The University of Oklahoma, where he majored in drama while his interest in folk music grew and eventually predominated.\n\nBrought to New York courtesy of the US Army, Tom remained there following his discharge. His early success in Greenwich Village coffeehouses, such as The Gaslight and The Bitter End, led to an ever-increasing circle of work. Then in 1965 he made his first tour of the United Kingdom \u2014 the beginning of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included at least one tour in each of the succeeding years.\n\nHe and his late wife, Midge, have two daughters, Jennifer and Kate. All three women have served as inspiration for many songs, and now three grandsons, Christopher, Sean, and Peter are adding to the sources of inspiration.\n\nHe has performed thousands of concerts around the world in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Hong Kong, Scandinavia, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, England, Scotland, Ireland and Canada. That these fans still enjoy his work is a testament to the quality of his recent work, and to the enduring power of modern standards like The Last Thing On My Mind, Ramblin\u2019 Boy, Bottle Of Wine, Whose Garden Was This?, Goin\u2019 To The Zoo and The Marvelous Toy. Paxton\u2019s songbooks, critically acclaimed children\u2019s books (available from HarperCollins \u2013 see the page for children), award-winning children\u2019s recordings, and a catalog of hundreds of songs (recorded by artists running the gamut from Willie Nelson to Placido Domingo), all serve to document Tom Paxton\u2019s 40-year career.\n\nTom received a 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy during the 51st Annual GRAMMY\u00ae Awards. He was nominated for a GRAMMY for Comedians and Angels in 2007, and Live in the U.K. in 2006. He was also nominated for GRAMMYS in 2003 for his Appleseed Records CD, Looking For The Moon, and in 2002 for his children\u2019s CD, Your Shoes, My Shoes. He has received the Lifetime Achievement Award from ASCAP, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the BBC in London.\n\nTom Paxton\u2019s place in folk music is secured not just by hit records and awards, but by the admiration of three generations of fellow musicians. An internationally recognized and loved cultural figure, he has always chosen goodwill over commercial success. His generosity has taken the shape of a benefit concert performance for a little girl fighting leukemia, or a personal note of encouragement to an up-and-coming songwriter. This is the man who wrote and lives the words, \u201cPeace will come, and let it begin with me.\u201d\n\nHe is one of the great songwriters of the last century and will be reckoned as one of the greats in this new century, as well. He is a man we have come to regard as our friend.\n\n\u201cTom Paxton\u2019s songs are so powerful and lyrical, written from the heart and the conscience, and they reach their mark, our most inner being. He writes stirring songs of social protest and gentle songs of love, each woven together with his personal gift for language. His melodies haunt, his lyrics reverberate. I have sung Tom\u2019s songs for three decades and will go on doing so in the new century, for they are beautiful and timeless, and meant for every age.\u201d (Judy Collins)\n\n\u201cTom Paxton embodies the spirit of folk music in the most beautiful sense. Not just in his song crafting, his work ethic, his politics and his dedication to people\u2019s music, but also in his kind and generous heart. When I first started playing folk festivals, I was all of eighteen, shaved headed and politically outspoken. Many people in the folk community at that time seemed defensive and threatened by me, but I remember Tom was a notable exception. He was nothing but warm, welcoming and supportive to me from the git go. He\u2019s the coolest.\u201d (Ani DiFranco)\n\n\u201cEvery folk singer I know has either sung a Tom Paxton song, is singing a Tom Paxton song or will soon sing a Tom Paxton song. Now either all the folk singers are wrong, or Tom Paxton is one hell of a songwriter.\u201d (Holly Near)", "otherInfo": "Tom Paxton & The DonJuans"}, {"Address": "Novato, CA", "Artist": "Don Henry", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7540793.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.5681, 38.1062], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hopmonk Presents, LLC", "moreBioInfo": "Grammy Award winner Don Henry's songs have been recorded by legends like:\nRay Charles, Patti Page and Conway Twitty\nBy country crooners like:\nGene Watson, John Conlee and B.J.

His experience in writing, publishing, producing and engineering has evolved him into the singer / songwriter / guitarist and entertainer he's become today.\n\nHe has shared the stage with: Joey Ramone/Al Gore/Pete Seeger/Steve Earle/Graham Gouldman/Ray Price/Livingston Taylor/Emmylou Harris/Jimmy Webb/Guy Clark/David Crosby/P.F.

So did Larry McClain of BAM magazine. Rolling Stone liked it enough to profile Don in their \"New Faces\" column. Enthusiastic reviews also appeared in Entertainment Weekly, Stereo Review, the Gavin Report, and other major daily newspapers.\n\nSince then Don has released a live album candidly recorded at the internationally famous Bluebird Caf\u00e9 in Nashville, Tennessee on the American Originals label.\nNot long after \"Live At The Bluebird\" he released his latest studio effort \"Flowers & Rockets\" on Poppermost Records and is in the process of recording his fourth album \"Based On A True Story\" due to be released by fall of 2007.\n\nAt Don's shows, you'll easily spot those who have yet to hear his songs; upon first experiencing them, the listener is often moved to laughter or tears, sometimes both at the same time! And everyone leaves humming, because Don Henry songs stay with you.\n\nDon's unique perspective is expressed in instantly memorable melodies and equally smart arrangements that appeal to listeners across musical borders, and across the nation.\n\nAs Dirty Linen observed about his Philadelphia Folk Festival appearance:\n\"The crowd was won over by this guy and his guitar.

Over a viscid, bluesy slide-guitar, the band transports you to the sweltering Texas heat, a \"land of oilfields, iron nightmares, and fevered dreams.\" That song, \"Good Evening,\" plants the band's flag firmly in the sand, simultaneously celebrating the pride of home and acknowledging the ominous clouds that hang over it, all while perfectly setting the stage for the raucous journey through time and space that follows.\n\nThe Night Hawks\u2014Anderson and Matsler on vocals and guitars, Pat Adams on bass, and Aaron Haynes on drums\u2014are a Southern band, to be sure, but it's not the South we've come to expect from our rock and roll. Equally influenced by ZZ Top and science fiction, they write of landscape both familiar and foreign, of a people working to shed their past but still burdened with its repercussions even in the distant future.\n\n\"Dave and I both pull from older artists when we write,\" says Anderson, \"but we're trying to put a new spin on it. We're harkening back to old Texas, but we're writing about a new southern culture, maintaining the past and moving it on into the future.\"\n\nEras collide in every aspect of the record, from the title\u2014which merges Texas' Spanish and Mexican roots with its role at the center of the modern space race\u2014to its pop art cover, depicting a classic hot rod from the 70's that's been modified into a spacecraft hovering over an exotic desert landscape. Songs like \"Mockingbird\" play out as a classic-rock road warrior's tale souped-up for the 22nd century, while \"Liberty Bell 7\" re-imagines current-day border issues through the eyes of a \"space coyote\" smuggling illegal immigrants on and off the planet. The track, which was engineered by Centromatic's Matt Pence, is actually named for a real NASA mission from 1961.\n\n\"At the time, it was the furthest into space that anything had gone,\" says Anderson, a huge space travel junkie. \"Upon reentry, it crashed into the ocean and filled with water and sunk down to the bottom. This thing had been as far out into space as you could go and as deep down into the ocean you could go, and that's how the narrator of the song feels, he's been as far out and as low down as you can get.\"\n\nThe Quaker City Night Hawks have been far out there, but they're anything but low down at the moment as they prepare for their first major foray into the national spotlight. Paste hailed the band's \"blues-infused southern\" sound, while the Dallas Observer dubbed the \"relevant and timeless\" rockers the Best Band of 2015, and several of their songs were featured in the hit FX series Sons of Anarchy. Anderson was one of the first to invite fellow Ft. Worth-native Leon Bridges to perform during set breaks at his shows, and the two recently reunited to perform for an upcoming Danny Clinch documentary which was teased during the GRAMMY Awards, and dates with Chris Stapleton, Lucero, J Roddy Walston, and Whiskey Myers have solidified the Night Hawks' status as one of the Lone Star State's most exciting new acts.\n\n\"Our name is pulled from a Mark Twain book called The Innocents Abroad or, The New Pilgrim's Progress,\" explains Anderson, \"where Twain, along with many other Americans, set out in 1867 aboard the chartered vessel Quaker City to see sites in Europe and the Holy Land. En route, he found that the only time his fellow passengers of varying religious backgrounds refrained from petty bickering and squabbles was when they met together at night to play cards, smoke, and drink. That gathering became collectively known as the Night Hawks.\"\n\nIt's a fitting moniker for a band that seeks to bring their audiences together every night onstage, but despite the group's clear sense of identity, El Astronauta was almost a very different record, as they aborted an early recording session only to revisit the songs later with a new perspective.\n\n\"Usually Dave and I write the songs and then we record them a few weeks later,\" explains Anderson, \"but on this one, because we decided to re-record, we had the opportunity to incorporate them into our live sets for a while, and songs can change so much when you play them 100 times in different cities.\"\n\n\"Our old studio habit was to get there and knock out as many drum and bass tracks in a day as possible,\" adds Adams, \"but this time around, we took the approach of trying to fully complete each song before moving on to the next, and that was a really good spark for our creative vision when we finally got back into the studio.\"\n\n\"There was definitely a gestation period,\" reflects Matsler, \"where we gave the songs time to develop on their own, and sometimes they changed pretty drastically.\"\n\nChange, and the need for it, is a central theme on the record, and one that weighs heavily on the bandmembers' minds as they enter a new phase of adulthood. \"Beat The Machine\" is a protest song of sorts according to Matsler, not against any one particular war but against the military and prison industrial complex that seems to hold a vice grip over modern American politics, while the JFK-inspired \"The Last Great Audit\" grimly assures that we'll \"never walk through the gates of His promised land 'til we shake off our bloody ancestors' blues,\" and album-closer \"Sons and Daughters\" is a rollicking dose of secular gospel.\n\n\"That song caps the album because it's about the realization that things aren't exactly right and they have to change,\" explains Matsler, \"but the changing part doesn't have to be sad or morose. It's a call-to-action to head out the door and change the world.\"\n\n\"This whole record sums up that feeling when you finally start to realize that you've been surrounded by bullshit,\" adds Anderson with a laugh. \"It's immense and depressing at first to understand that things aren\u2019t the way people told you they would be growing up, but coming out the other side, you see everybody else is in the same boat. We've been lied to for a long time, but now it's time to figure it out and move on and do something about it.\"\n\nFor the Quaker City Night Hawks, that means getting onstage and singing their hearts out every night. This isn't the South of their fathers, nor is it the America they'd been promised growing up, but we're all in it together, and maybe, by the time souped-up hot rod spaceships are cruising between planets, we'll have learned a lesson from the original Night Hawks onboard the Quaker City and put aside our differences long enough to make life just a little better for everybody.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Fast Times (SF)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9918996.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "There are two pieces of evidence of the debut live performance of FAST TIMES \u2013 a new project from Bay Area music scene stalwarts Andrew St. James, Duncan Nielsen (Doncat, Geographer), and Cody Rhodes (Sandy's, CURLS, Geographer).\n\nOne is a shaky video taken by a member of San Francisco band Sandy's from the green room at The Chapel, showing an enamored crowd and a widely grinning St. James, minutes into the trio\u2019s rousing track \u201cTuesday Night.\u201d The other, from the opposite angle and taken just a few moments later, a still photograph by local music photography luminary Paige K.

Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "Tom Paxton & The DonJuans + Amy Speace"}, {"Address": "224 Vintage Wy, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "The Don Juans", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7544296.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.55345, 38.088411], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hopmonk Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "The long-awaited songwriter duo of Don Henry & Jon Vezner has finally come together as \"The Don Juans\"!

As Tommy approached his teens, he discovered guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. Deeply inspired, he picked up the guitar and never looked back. A few years later Odetto was a semi-finalist for Guitar Center\u2019s King of the Blues. He was also featured in Guitar Player magazine as an artist to watch. After two successful stints with local bands, in 2016 he decided to pursue his dream of being a frontman.\n\nSince the move to fronting his own band, Tommy has been fortunate to be invited to perform at Bottlerock Napa 2018, and has opened for bands like, Chevy Metal, Tommy Castro, Coco Montoya, Y&T, Walter Trout, Uriah Heep, Ace Frehley, Trainwreck with Kyle Gass (Tenacious D) and Robin Trower to name a few.

Five original melodic hard rock songs that highlight his raw, honest lyrics and peel back the curtain of the heart and mind of Odetto. Curses and Revelations features many standout guitar moments that are so passionate and soulful that it\u2019s as if we are witness to a musical truth serum.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "Edward Simon, a native of Venezuela, has made a name for himself over decades in America as a jazz improviser, composer-arranger, band leader and educator. DownBeat has called him \u201cone of the strongest pianists of his generation, with intuitive empathy and drum-like ingenuity,\u201d while Jazz Journal International has singled out \u201chis deep emotional statements\u201d as a composer and improviser. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area as a member of the all-star SFJAZZ Collective, he has been a Guggenheim Fellow along with being awarded multiple composition grants as part of the Chamber Music America\u2019s New Jazz Works initiative. Simon, a Yamaha artist, has recorded 15 albums as a leader or co-leader. His latest is Sorrows and Triumphs, released via Sunnyside Records in April 2018; the album was declared \u201cunmissable\u201d in Nate Chinen\u2019s Take Five column on WBGO.org, and the pianist was featured in an extensive DownBeat interview upon the disc\u2019s release. This follows Simon\u2019s 2016 album Latin American Songbook, which won him an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Jazz Album; a four-and-a-half-star DownBeat review also praised his fresh vision of classic Latin American songs as \u201cgrand and sophisticated.\u201d\n\nAnother key release for Simon was his 2014 Sunnyside album Venezuelan Suite, which saw the pianist blend the tuneful, buoyant sounds of his native country with the harmonically sophisticated, forward-looking manner of jazz. All About Jazz marveled: \u201cVenezuelan Suite\u2026 is the perfect confluence of Venezuelan ideals, jazz language and chamber-esque sophistication. In short, it\u2019s a masterpiece.\u201d One of Simon\u2019s most recent collaborative projects is the trio Steel House, with the pianist joined by bassist Scott Colley and drummer Brian Blade for a group that blends acoustic jazz improvisation with electronic-tinged atmospherics for an inviting, song-oriented sound.

On the musician\u2019s second solo album, Devour, Hause scours the foundation of that crumbled dream in an attempt to discover how everything we believed growing up could have turned out so differently. The album, initially written to become the third record from Hause\u2019s rock band The Loved Ones, follows his 2011 solo debut Resolutions, a disc that allowed the musician to understand his potential as his own artist.\n\nAs Hause, a Philadelphia native, began penning new music for a new album from The Loved Ones, it became clear that the group, who had taken a break after their second album, had stalled. These songs, however, which showcased a clear thematic journey, were meant to be vocalized by Hause and over the past few years he transformed them into Devour. Hause solidified the album\u2019s sequence before even going into the studio, aiming to craft a narrative arc that drove the album from its dark, heavy first half into a lighter, more hopeful tone. A thematic line of melody runs through the songs, reflecting the overarching ideas in the music itself. The disc explores the heartbreak of shattered childhood promises of a better world and concludes with optimistic hope.\n\n\u201cDevour is about that inherent American appetite,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt\u2019s in all the songs in some degree. There\u2019s a reason why Tony Soprano became such a huge American icon \u2013 he\u2019s this guy with this insane appetite for women and food and power. I think for the American public to latch onto a figure like that says something. Some of the positive things about America come from that as well, but there\u2019s a real sense of reckoning that comes from devouring everything in front of you. Is it ever enough?\u201d\n\nThe rock songs, tinged with folk and punk tones, are firmly rooted in Hause\u2019s own upbringing and the sensibility that comes from growing up in a blue collar neighborhood driven by the lingering anticipation of upward mobility. In the lyrics, the fulcrum around which the album revolves, Hause grapples with this working class ideal and the fact that America\u2019s recent shifts have caused it to no longer fit. From \u201cThe Great Depression,\u201d which centers on the unfulfilled promises laid out in the Reagan-era \u201880s, to the more specific-minded relationships of \u201cFather\u2019s Son,\u201d Devour comes to terms with the loss of youthful innocence in a rapidly evolving world.\n\n\u201cI wanted to shine a light back on what was going on,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt was a topic that was close to me and I wanted to write about it. In the end, it leaves you with the idea that if you have music and love you may be able to save yourself. It\u2019s going to be alright. That simple John Lennon concept of all you need is love. That\u2019s how I wrote myself out of the dark and the music begs the listener to come take that risk as well.\u201d\n\nOnce Hause had the track sequence and overall narrative in place he enlisted producer Andrew Alekel along with musician and co-producer Mitchell Townsend. The producers helped Hause collect the right musicians to build the songs in the best way possible, including My Morning Jacket keyboardist Bo Koster, Social Distortion drummer David Hidalgo Jr. and bassist Bob Thomson. Frightened Rabbit\u2019s Scott Hutchison, Alkaline Trio\u2019s Matt Skiba and The Watson Twins also appear on several tracks. Hause and his crew recorded the album over several weeks from mid-February to mid-March at Grandmaster Recorders LTD. in Hollywood, CA, focusing on giving each song the right tone while maintaining an overall musical aesthetic that helps tie the lyrical themes together.\n\n\u201cIt was this group effort,\u201d Hause says. \u201cA lot of trust went into letting Andrew and Mitch be the architects of the record. I trusted that we would get in there and they would know who was right for the music. They wanted to bring these people together in this great studio to get a record that was greater than the sum of its parts. I\u2019m glad I trusted them because it was great to work with everyone there.\u201d\n\nFor the musician, who has toured with Social Distortion, The Gaslight Anthem, Bouncing Souls and Chuck Ragan since launching his solo career, Devour is a cathartic release, both sonically and lyrically. Hause recently relocated to California and is committed to pursing the music he feels best reflects him individually. The journey on the album, the search for the light at the end of the tunnel, mirrors his own trek. The record closes with the delicate introspection of \u201cBenediction,\u201d a song that pulls lyrical lines from all the tracks that precede it. After all the ruined promises and the culminating disappointments of the world, Hause ends the album with the sentiment of possibility. \u201cIt's love my friend in the end that can save us tonight,\u201d he sings. \u201cSo are you in?\u201d", "otherInfo": "Dave Hause & The Mermaid"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "AngelicaGarcia", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8798659.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Songs are lyric heavy with folky, bluesy under, Thoughtful, bumpin, alt-rock, pop songwriter", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "With Mexican and Salvadoran roots in the San Gabriel Valley, East of Los Angeles, Angelica Garcia has spent the last few years creating a new, second family for herself within the welcoming community of Richmond, VA.

Born in South Florida in 1980 of Ecuadorian heritage, Lange made his recording debut in the early 2000s, when he released music under a few different monikers, most notably ROM (a collaboration with drummer Matt Crum), Epstein, and Boom & Birds. The eponymous album ROM (2005) on Wimm Recordings is a compilation of Lange's collaborations with Crum dating back to 2000. He was most prolific as Epstein, releasing the full-length albums Pu\u00f1al (2004), Gente Sin Pueblo (2005), Canto de Hermanos (2007), and Otros (2008); the former two on the label Botanica del Jibaro, the latter two on Arepaz. As Boom & Birds, he released the album Camino de Manos Chuecas (2005) on Arepaz.\nEverything She Touched Turned Ampexian After moving to Brooklyn, New York, in 2006, Lange began a fruitful collaboration with Guillermo Scott Herren, earning co-production credits on the Prefuse 73 releases The Class of 73 Bells (2007) and Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian (2009) on Warp Records, plus the Savath + Savalas album La Llama (2009) on Stones Throw. In the wake of these high-profile releases in collaboration with Herren, Lange made his album debut as Helado Negro with Awe Owe (2009) on Asthmatic Kitty. A highly collaborative effort, Awe Owe featured input from Herren, former ROM collaborator Crum (also of Feathers), Jon Philpot (the frontman of Bear in Heaven), and numerous others. By contrast, Lange recorded Helado Negro's second album, 2011's Canta Lechuza (\"Owl Singing\") after holing up in a cabin in Connecticut. In 2012, Lange collaborated with Julianna Barwick as OMBRE, releasing the album Believe You Me. Invisible Life, which featured Lange singing in English as well as Spanish, arrived in early 2013.\nDouble YouthHelado Negro returned in 2014 with Double Youth, a nostalgic, home-recorded set of songs that took inspiration from a poster he had owned since childhood and rediscovered while cleaning out a closet. In 2015, collaborators including Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier and Wilco's Mikael Jorgensen helped bring songs from Helado Negro's Island Universe Story cassette series to St. Paul, Minnesota's Ordway Concert Hall as Island Universe Story: Selected Works. The following year, all three volumes of Island Universe Story -- which were released between 2012 and 2014 -- were issued as a compilation by Asthmatic Kitty. Helado Negro's next album was preceded by a pair of singles, 2015's \"Young, Latin & Proud\" and \"It's My Brown Skin,\" reflecting the themes of Latin pride and cultural awareness found on the rest of Private Energy.

Not soon after Chris began taking formal guitar lessons he picked up \u201cThe Beatles Greatest Hits For Guitar\u201d and taught himself to play every song in the book. Over the last 15 years Chris has developed his song craft by playing in different bands, home recording himself and diving deep into the songwriting skills of artists like Ani DiFranco, Paul Simon and Keller Williams.\nIn early 2007 Chris left the band Moon Shine Blue to pursue a solo music career in the Orlando Area. He started by playing every \u2018open mike\u2019 that he could find. Armed with his acoustic guitar and a digital delay pedal he began widening his repertoire and developed his live looping technique. \u201cI\u2019m nowhere near guys like Keller Williams but I do enough to sound full in a loud bar setting.\u201d Mixing originals with a few carefully selected covers, Chris began to build a loyal following and started opening up for bands like The Fling and K-G and the Band in downtown Orlando.\n\nChris met Jason Gloria and Alex Eastman of Diatonic Productions soon after he started in Orlando.

On this CD Chris plays acoustic and electric guitar, banjo, mouth flugel (made popular by Keller Williams) and performs the vocals with support from Alex Eastman on bass and Erik de la Cruz on percussion (both from The Fling). \u201cCB RADIO\u201d sounds like a full band project at points while keeping the intimate feel of a solo acoustic singer/songwriter.\n\nIn the next several months Chris intends to build on his initial success by following the release of \u201cCB RADIO\u201d with some live recordings and a full-length album already in the works that will include a video of the title track. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just focusing on playing in and around Orlando to get better known.

The album arrives September 2015 and is an exciting step forward for the hard working artist. 2014 saw Goud and his band mates build their audience around the world with over 160 shows throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the UK. The new record reflects Northcote's punk rock and folk influences while sonically embracing the rock sound that they have developed through 18 months of near constant touring on the road.\n\n\u201cWhen I was putting together songs for this record, I wanted to pursue the ones that didn't feel necessarily like Northcote-type songs.\u201d Goud says. There was a big batch that I knew could work and that could fit well with the other records, but I wanted to pursue the material that felt surprising and challenging to me. The record feels vulnerable in that way and reflects some of the experiences I have had in life and from all the touring we have done.\u201d\n\nHope Is Made of Steel confirms emphatically that Northcote has emerged from a coffee house singer/songwriter into something more fleshed out and fierce. Following years of solo touring around the world, Goud and his band mates Stephen McGillivray (guitar), Mike Battle (bass) and Derek Heathfield (drums) ventured together on Northcote\u2019s European headlining tour and in the Spring of 2015 the same group supported New Jersey icons The Gaslight Anthem on a five-week tour across North America. Northcote\u2019s larger scale full band tours of the past months have foreshadowed Hope Is Made Of Steel, which is forged by Americana-rock electric guitar and soulful hard-hitting rock drums.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been touring solo or with various arrangements for almost seven years and I\u2019m in a place where I want to start playing more electric guitar, feeling that energy and freedom you get with playing the songs loud and with the band. With this record it is a priority for me to bring a more dynamic show on the road.\"\n\nAlong with a heavy touring schedule Goud, his wife Brittany and their two dogs Libby and Gigi have uprooted twice in the past year moving from Victoria to Ottawa and back again, nearly 3,000 miles in each direction. The theme of movement and finding ones place in the world continues to be a central theme for Northcote, however this time the feeling is more clearly communicated and soaked in experience.\n\n\u201cIn between tours I was writing songs in the basement of Lydia\u2019s bar on Bank Street in Ottawa. When we decided to move back to Victoria, Britt went ahead of the dogs and I to find an apartment. I spent a couple more weeks alone in Ottawa before driving the car across the country with the dogs. Upon arrival in Victoria, I turned around and immediately started tracking the new album in Vancouver that very next weekend. We had the bed tracks done before the moving truck showed up. I think that stress and energy influenced the album positively by allowing me to be more raw and direct in the writing and making of the record.\u201d\n\nHope Is Made Of Steel was produced by Vancouver-based Musician and Producer Dave Genn (54-40, Hedley, Matthew Good Band). Additional special collaborators and contributors include producer Gavin Brown (Metric, Billy Talent), and guest vocal appearances by Canadian songstress Hannah Georgas, and two of Goud\u2019s biggest influences \u2013 Chuck Ragan and Dave Hause.\n\nGoud credits the artists he has toured with in the past two years as influences on his work ethic, and approach to writing and performing live.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough in the past couple years to support some of my heroes in music. I learned that seizing the moment in front of you is the most important aspect to touring. I look up to musicians like Chuck (Ragan) and Dave (Hause) in particular and how their personality and spirit is so visible in their music. I think there is a lot of dread in that vulnerability, but there is also a type of freedom. I\u2019ve always been attracted to artists who are 'laying-it-on-the-line\u2019, no matter what the genre may be.\u201d\n\nAlthough the album sounds brave and fresh, there is plenty of dynamic and variety here. \u2018Small Town Dreams\u2019 is the third track and represents a progression for the band to a more alternative/modern rock leaning sound. The song tells the story of small town youthful naivety \u2013 all the hopes and dreams of the two characters someday making it to the big city. In contrast, the track \u2018Leaving Wyoming\u2019 echoes the sensitivity and heart-on-your-sleeve storytelling that of tracks from previous albums such as \u2018Speak Freely\u2019 from the album Northcote (2013) and \u2018Under the Streetlights\u2019 from the album Gather No Dust (2011).\n\n\"There is a clarity to the songs that I think I may have struggled with in the past.\u201d Goud admits. \u201cI remember playing at the Horseshoe in Toronto last summer and a friend asked me what a particular song of mine meant to me, and I didn\u2019t haven\u2019t a very clear answer. I feel on this record, I have written a batch of songs that are more direct and that feels less safe. I challenged myself to be more lyrically direct on this album, and I believe I have accomplished that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Dave Hause & The Mermaid"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Rick Lollar", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7454485.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Put The Stank On It", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "ATL based guitarist, singer-songwriter for King Baby, Weisshund, and Jamison Ross.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "453 Cortland ave, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Rock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6643774.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.416775, 37.739269], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-hop, Hip Hop, Rap", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lucky Horseshoe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rock and Blues Jam with Ed Ivey This classic blues & funk jam session is a popular mid-week event featuring great local blues players.

His debut self-titled solo album was released Nov. 7, 2006 on Interscope/Shoot to Kill Records in association with MySpace Records. Avalon blends dark, lewd, and crizzled lyrical hooks with hip-hop beats.\n\nFrequent topics of Avalon's songs are his experiences with substance abuse and prostitution. His family upbringing was tumultuous and both he and his parents were involved with drugs. Avalon's paternal grandparents are Holocaust survivors; both endured lasting injuries from their imprisonment at Auschwitz.\n\nAvalon is friends with Antonio, who encouraged Avalon to write lyrics and perform when Mickey was broke and living on Anton's sofa. Avalon soon gained a following in the Los Angeles nightclub scene. He has since enjoyed a surge in popularity partly due to promotion of his music on the MySpace website.\n\nIn the media\n\nAvalon appeared on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show on Friday the February 23, 2007.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of The Simple Life where he auditioned to perform the song \"Friends and Lovers\" at a lesbian wedding.\n\nAvalon's sexually-themed song \"Jane Fonda\" was featured in HBO's Entourage.\n\nAvalon appeared on Steven's Untitled Rock Show on Wednesday the April 3, 2007\n\nAvalon replaced Gnarls Barkley as the opening act for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on March 12, 2007 in Oklahoma City. At that show John Frusciante joined Avalon onstage and criticized the audience for their poor reception and \"booing\" of Avalon. Avalon repeatedly told the audience he wasn't wanting to get in the way of the Chili Peppers performing, he was just there to \"pay the rent\". Frusciante also sent a very long and heated letter to the fans of www.redhotchilipeppers.com explaining how upset he was at the audiences' disrespect of Avalon.\n\nJune 24, 2007, Avalon was booed again at a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. The audience threw sandwiches, apples, lollipops and wood mulch at him, chanted \"Loser!\", gave him the finger, and turned their backs on him. Mickey replied by throwing things back and he again stated \"I don't care, I got paid to be here...\". Mickey refused to stop playing however at first, but after half an hour he left while he should've performed an hour.\n\nInspite of Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante's opinion, stating that Mickey Avalon is a really talented artist, his performance in The Netherlands was probably not one of his best. Shortly after getting on stage he grabbed a bottle of liquer, and he deliberately pulled down his pants showing off his butt. The Dutch crowd couldn't appreciate this behaviour and started \"booing\" him and throwing things at him. Mickey actually started provoking the crowd be stating: \"The Dutch are clearly not good at baseball, cause 60.000 people can't hit me\". He went on displaying some weird stage behaviour. He left the stage early, but not before he kicked his microphone in the direction of the audience. Even the soundcheckers from the band that performed after him got a bigger applause than Mickey Avalon.\n\nJuly 3, 3007 Avalon gave show in Chorzow, Poland, again before Red Hot Chili Peppers and after 30 minutes audience gave him finger, \"booing\" started. Avalon said that he love them and left stage. No items were thrown.\n\nAvalon appeared onstage with Shaun Ryder and the rest of the Happy Mondays at the 2007 Coachella Music Festival in Indio, Calif.\n\nAvalon opened for T.I. at the University of California, Santa Barbara's \"Extravaganza\" event in May 2007.\n\nCollaborations\n\nOn Unwritten Law's 2007 greatest hits/remix album, The Hit List, Avalon performs \"Shoulda Known Better\".\n\nAvalon is a member of the trio Dyslexic Speedreaders with Simon Rex (AKA Dirt Nasty) and Andre Legacy.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

He was born in 1972 in Nebraska, living in California, Tennessee, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, Georgia, and Arizona during the years to follow; obsessed as a teen with British cult favorites like The Smiths and The Cure, he learned to play guitar from his uncle and wrote his first song at 18.\n\nSigning to the Rykodisc subsidiary Slow River, in 1998, Rouse issued his debut album, Dressed Up Like Nebraska, to widespread critical acclaim; upon settling in Nashville, he was befriended by Kurt Wagner, frontman of the endlessly brilliant chamber country group Lambchop, and in the fall of 1999, the two singers/songwriters issued a collaborative EP, Chester. Rouse's second solo LP, Home, appeared the following spring and was followed by Under the Cold Blue Stars in 2002. For his next record Rouse hooked up with producer Brad Jones and the resulting album in 2003, 1972, was both a homage to the soft rock sounds of Rouse's youth and an opening up and deepening of his sound. Before the release of his next album, Rouse's marriage ended and he moved from Nashville to Spain. This spawned 2004's Nashville, an example of his versatile musical talent, featuring a blend of Rock, Jazz and Ballad. It served as a farewell to both the city and his marriage; it was also his most fully realized record to date. This album was chosen as one of Amazon.com's Top 100 Editor's Picks of 2005 (#80).\n\nRouse's next album, called Subtitulo, was released March 21, 2006 in which his move to Spain was evident.It marked a further finessing of his sound and a move towards the music of an early Paul Simon.\n\n2007 saw a rather busy year for Rouse. He started off supporting John Mayer on a series of his Winter Tour dates. Not soon after, he released a joint EP with his girlfriend Paz Suay, under the moniker of she's spanish, i'm american. At the end of July, Rouse released his 7th LP, Country Mouse, Cit y House. The record marked a detour from Subtitulo, offering a fuller, more instrumental sound, which appeared to divide both critics and fans. Rouse toured extensively worldwide to support the album.", "otherInfo": "This show is 21+ and partially seated / Doors at 7:00 PM.

The result of this decision is the band Vitriol, which soon involved Gianluca Pappalardo, Pierangelo Carvello and Alessandro Sanfilippo. These musicians contributed their professional influences to enrich the style of the new band, inspired by the modern progressive rock & metal genre and by the musical experiences of the 70\u2019s historical bands. V.i.t.r.i.o.l. is the acronym of one of the most famous mottos of Renaissance alchemy: \u201cVisita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem\u201d (Enter the bowels of the Earth and, through your purification, you will find the hidden stone). It is a metaphor representing the path of man inside his own Ego in order to finally find the philosophical Truth. In the same way, the main character of the story of their first EP, called Knowledge, has a quests for his beloved, Truth; he reaches the destination after a number of pitfalls and after meeting some allegorical characters (such as Faith and Insanity) he\u2019s also wrong-footed by the words of his beloved. The double meaning of the term \u201cvitriol\u201d (corrosive chemical element and acronym of the renaissance motto) can describe well the essence of the band, constantly hanging in the balance between its aggressive component and its introspective/reflective one. Once the first collected work of the band was distributed to media, it immediately generated lots of good reviews by the alternative rock and metal magazines in both paper and digital media: the EP received 15.5/16 in issue #59 of the prestigious Progression Magazine, the best score as \u201cindependent release\u201d and one of the best scores among 200 label\u2019s supported albums. It is considered the \"Best Demo of the Month\" in the November issue of Metal Maniac, one of the most important magazine in Italy, and received 8 out of 10 in a majority of the most famous international webzines, such as UsaProgressiveMusic, Rock Hard, Progressive Ears, MetalWave, Unprogged, TrueMetal, Metallo Italiano, Eutk, Nova Muzique as well as many others. Subsequently, the band caught the attention of the American label Melodic Revolution Records which has added Vitriol to their roster in 2010. During the same year Tommaso Semrov joined the band as guitarist and Vitriol started pre-producing their first full-length album \"Into The Silence I Sink\" which was released in November 2012. Recorded, mixed and mastered at Fear Studio in Ravenna and at the band's studio in Bologna, published by Melodic Revolution Records, it's a concept album revolving around the theme of Silence, metaphorically approached as \"deep absence of communication\". 10 songs, conducive to an analysis of the different causes of this absence of communication: the anonymity of the urban environment, the historical contraposition of Ideologies (Outward Silence, between person and person), differences between who we are and who we appear to be (Inner Silence, between the own appearance and essence). Concluding the album, the last song analyzes what must have been the most atrocious communicative Silence that has ever happened: a bewildered Christ asking \"My God, my God, why did you abandon me\"? \u201cInto The Silence I Sink\" was evaluated by the international press as one of the best albums of 2012. The American radio show Prog Metal Show put the album at the 8th place in the \"Top 50 progressive metal albums of the year\". The band promoted their work with two official videos, \"The Frozen Wind\" and \"Slowly She Dies\", and the \"Making of\" the album. In 2013-2014 Vitriol toured Europe across Italy, UK, Poland, Austria and in 2015-2016 performed as opener of Pain of Salvation, Evergrey, Soen, Kingcrow. At present they're working on their next album, with Gabriele Gozzi as new lead vocalist of the band.

The Village Voice called Obsolescence \u201ctirelessly inventive\u201d, eventually crowning ABYSMAL DAWN the #1 spot on their 10 Best Metal Albums year-end list. Early samples of ABYSMAL DAWN\u2019s Season of Mist debut demonstrate the trio\u2019s newfound power, ingenuity, and songcraft. Certainly, ABYSMAL DAWN\u2019s new opus picks up where Obsolescence left off, but it promises so much more.\n\nFormed in 2004, ABYSMAL DAWN quickly impressed on fan and band alike. The group\u2019s three-song demo landed ABYSMAL DAWN a contract with Arizona-based Crash Music. Within a year, the group were holed up with engineer John Haddad (Intronaut, Hirax) at Shiva Industries recording their debut, From Ashes. Released in 2006, From Ashes was praised for its tactful balance of brutality, melody, and atmosphere, earning heavy praise from media outlets. Blabbermouth gushed, calling it, \u201cirreproachably constructed.\u201d Follow-up album, Programmed to Consume, again engineered by Haddad, was released in 2008 following a higher profile deal with Relapse Records. Immediately, the press heralded Programmed to Consume\u2014\u201cthinking man\u2019s metal\u201d said AllMusic.\n\nAfter subsequent tours, the group wrote the successor to Programmed to Consume up through the recording sessions at Artisan Road Studios (with producer Mike Bear) and Trench Studios (again with Haddad). Titled Leveling the Plane of Existence, ABYSMAL DAWN\u2019s third album broke new ground with fan and press alike. Metalsucks called Leveling the Plane of Existence, \u201ccrushing modern death metal\u201d, while Pandora found it, \u201csavage\u201d. Clearly, ABYSMAL DAWN\u2019s bridging of death metal eras, songwriting prowess, and growing social buzz was eliciting the type of response for a band on their way up. Subsequent tours were successful in establishing ABYSMAL DAWN as one of America\u2019s leading death metal acts.\n\nLeveling the Plane of Existence was followed by Obsolescence three years later. ABYSMAL DAWN were dead set on perfecting their brand of death metal. So, they set out to write an all killer, no filler record. Producer Bear and engineer Haddad were brought onboard again to track Obsolescence. What had worked mercilessly (the production) on Leveling the Plane of Existence was in no need of change. The result of ABYSMAL DAWN running on all cylinders and their production team dialing in on the group\u2019s distinct sound resulted in a death metal powerhouse. Popmatters called it \u201cnuclear-powered\u201d and Teeth of the Divine opined it\u2019s a record that \u201cwants to cave your damn head in.\u201d Four albums in, ABYSMAL DAWN weren\u2019t just proficient in the finer arts of death, they were proven masters of it.\n\nAs a new age sets upon ABYSMAL DAWN\u2014the Angelenos are entering their 13th year\u2014there\u2019s no turning back. The group aren\u2019t interested in throttling down on their quality commitment to death metal and they\u2019re certainly not ready to let their legion of fans down by shifting gears into death metal-lite.

Hailed as \u201cthe reigning queen of avant-garde cello\u201d by The Washington Post, she has been called a \u201ccello rock star,\u201d by Rolling Stone and praised as \u201ca force of nature,\u201d by The Boston Globe.\n\nRaised in the Galilee Mountains in Israel, by her Argentinean father and French mother, Maya spent her early life surrounded by the music and rituals of Jews, Muslims, and Christians, while studying classical cello repertoire. At the age of 12, she was discovered by the late violinist Isaac Stern who became her mentor throughout her early career. Reinventing solo cello performance in the mainstream arena, Maya is a featured performer on the world\u2019s most prestigious stages including Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Brooklyn Academy of Music, the John F.

Now I take back my doubt so that you\u2019ll crawl.\n\nSummer Cannibals\u2019 fourth album Can\u2019t Tell Me No, out June 28th on Tiny Engines, is a defiant release whose very existence is the result of taking back power\u2014after escaping a manipulative personal and creative relationship, guitarist/vocalist and bandleader Jessica Boudreaux chose to scrap an entire record that had been finished for over a year and start from scratch. \u201cWe had to sacrifice an album we\u2019d worked hard on so that someone abusive and manipulative couldn\u2019t benefit from it,\u201d says Boudreaux. \u201cIt was, in a matter of 24 hours, making the decision to start something new or let them win.\u201d\n\nCreation and determination prevailed; along with Cassi Blum, Devon Shirley, and Ethan Butman, Boudreaux wrote and recorded and mixed many of the new tracks during 14-hour days. She and Blum hunkered down in Boudreaux\u2019s home studio, where they had been already been engineering records for other bands, and finished Can\u2019t Tell Me No as Summer Cannibals\u2019 first entirely self-engineered and produced album.\n\n\u201cWriting this record and making it ourselves was about liberation from the parts of an industry that have protected abusers for way too long, and about saying fuck you to the people who have invalidated my and so many others\u2019 experiences of abuse,\u201d says Boudreaux. \u201cIt's really easy for people to condemn the government and figures we see on the news,\u201d says Boudreaux, \u201cbut those same people often fail when it comes to standing up to and calling out the people in their lives who are just as evil.\u201d Songs like \u201cFalse Anthem\u201d confront this cowardice; \u201cHate who they are, say you hate what they do,\u201d snarls Boudreaux against an insistent, hard-charging guitar, \u201cbut you love all the things that they promise you.\u201d\n\nThe Cannibals formed in 2012 and gained a fervent following on the local Portland scene, eventually playing with some of their musical heroes including L7, Mudhoney, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, and The War on Drugs, and touring with Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Cursive. They've played some major festivals including Sasquatch, Project Pabst and Riot Fest, and made their TV debut in 2016 on Last Call with Carson Daly. Along the way, they released 2013\u2019s No Makeup and 2015\u2019s Show Us Your Mind on their own label, New Moss Records, and 2016\u2019s Full Of It on Kill Rock Stars. Show Us Your Mind appeared on NPR\u2019s Sound Opinions Best of list in 2015, and Pitchfork said that on Full Of It, the Cannibals \u201cexpertly balance flame-belching Mad Max riffage with lyrics frankly exploring questions of co-dependence and need.\u201d\n\nNow with Can\u2019t Tell Me No, the Cannibals are as honest and confrontational as they\u2019ve ever been; though ironically, more harmonious as a band. With the inspiration and adrenaline driving the new album\u2019s creation, the current members of Summer Cannibals are working together in a new, reinvigorated way. \u201cThis is the first time that we've had all four members who are really dedicated and care about their role in the band,\u201d says Boudreaux. \u201cWe function as a unit and everything goes so smoothly. I think we all feel very supported.\u201d That support comes through in the confidence on songs like \u201cLike I Used To,\u201d a self-assured anthem to the renewal that comes with independence and leaving violent toxicity behind you.\n\nBecause where there is anger there is also hope, and Can\u2019t Tell Me No is, as much as anything, about finding love and acceptance on the other side of pain. \u201cPart of getting over my past has meant looking forward and letting myself know that I'm capable of love in the context of an honest, open and communicative relationship,\u201d says Boudreaux. Songs like \u201cInto Gold\u201d encapsulate this; a warm,Be My Baby manifesto that promises \u201cI\u2019ll be the one to want to break this mold, pull you out of the dark and back into gold.\u201d\n\nAnd on a larger scale, Can\u2019t Tell Me No stands up not just to a relationship or an industry, but to the people and constructs that have been trying to silence women and hold them down for so long. \u201cIt\u2019s about doing the right thing,\u201d says Boudreaux, \u201ceven when it\u2019s terrifying.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1600 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "The band ICE CREAM", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7396444.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399885, 37.765168], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Dairy Rock \\\\ Melting Pop", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Thee Parkside", "moreBioInfo": "A Bulgarian hip-hop band, consists of 4 members - Ice D, Vicky, Monty & Toddy.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "562 Green St, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Phil Griffiths", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9046383.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.40841, 37.799763], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Columbus Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "Comedian", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Stymie", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Pop Punk, Punk, Grunge, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Stymie is pop-punk from Denton, Texas.", "otherInfo": "General Admission."}, {"Address": "453 Cortland ave, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Rock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6643774.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.416775, 37.739269], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-hop, Hip Hop, Rap", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lucky Horseshoe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rock and Blues Jam with Ed Ivey This classic blues & funk jam session is a popular mid-week event featuring great local blues players.

Shortly after completion of the EP, Tyler stepped back from the project and the band was lucky enough to recruit Matt Gotlin-Sheehan shortly after.\n\nIn early 2020, Hydraform will embark on their largest tour to date, supporting thrash-metal heavyweights Overkill and Exhorder on a a sprawling winter tour spanning over three weeks and 17 dates.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2470 First St #100, Livermore, CA 94550", "Artist": "Toree McGee", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9049618.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.767565, 37.683205], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Last Word", "moreBioInfo": "Blessed with a rafter-reaching soprano range and a voice that emanates grit and fire, Toree McGee describes her music as a blend of \u201cWoodstock rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, and sparkly country.\u201d This eclectic style is equal parts percussion-driven swagger and playful melodies. Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "The Memphis Murder Men", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "\"WITH A MIX OF 50s DOO-WOP, ROCK N ROLL CHORD PROGRESSIONS, SEX, VIOLENCE, AND HORROR MOVIES THE MEMPHIS MURDER MEN TAKE THEIR MUSIC SERIOUSLY AND MAKE SURE YOU KNOW IT.\"\n\nTHE MEMPHIS MURDER MEN(FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BRAIN INVADERS) FORMED OVER SIX YEARS AGO, AND HAVE PLAYED EVERY VENU IN PITTSBURGH AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS.

Having inspired countless other musicians, Dave has worked in many genres that typically blend instrumental pop, R&B and lately, more and more traditional jazz. He released his first solo album Taking Off in 1975, but has been playing the saxophone since before he was in high school when he was inspired by the great Chicago blues artists near his hometown of St. Louis.\nHaving contracted polio at the age of three, Dave was introduced to the saxophone as part of his treatment therapy. By the age of 14, he was able to play with legends such as Albert King and Little Milton. Dave went on to study music at Northwestern University before transferring to the University of Iowa where he played and studied with the great saxophonist JR Monterose.\nLater traveling to California on the advice of a friend, he joined the Butterfield Blues Band and played Woodstock with Paul Butterfield. Following that, Dave toured with Stevie Wonder and recorded for Wonder\u2019s Talking Book album, played with The Rolling Stones, and toured with David Bowie with whom he recorded the famous solo heard on \u201cYoung Americans.\u201d At the same time, Dave was touring and recording with the great Gil Evans, dividing his time between the two. After moving to New York City and studying with George Coleman, Dave started his solo career where he later collaborated with such artists as Paul Simon and James Taylor.\nDave\u2019s solo release of Taking Off in 1975\u2014still considered a classic\u2014further solidified his career. His 1979 release of Hideaway became a popular hit and further propelled Dave\u2019s ascent with the single, \u201cSeduction\u201d being featured in the movie, American Gigolo. Veteran bassist and composer Marcus Miller joined Dave on the 1981 album, Voyeur. The single, \u201cAll I Need Is You\u201d won Dave his first Grammy Award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance. In 1983, Dave released the hit album Backstreet that included Luther Vandross as a featured guest vocalist. Later albums have included guest artists such as Jack DeJohnette, Bill Frisell, Charlie Hayden, Wallace Roney, Kenny Barron, Christian McBride, and Eric Clapton.\nMoving onto television, Dave hosted the show, Night Music, from 1988 to 1990.\nProduced by Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels, the show featured films of jazz legends like Thelonious Monk, Dave Brubeck and Billie Holiday, as well as banter and memorable music jams by a remarkable list of musicians including Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, Joe Sample, Pharoah Sanders, and many others. Additionally, Dave had regularly hosted the After New Year's Eve TV special on ABC. During the 1980s and 1990s, Dave hosted a syndicated radio program, The Jazz Show with David Sanborn. Dave has also recorded many shows' theme songs as well as several other songs for The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder.\nIn his four-and-a-half decade career, Dave continues to be one of the most highly active musicians of his genre, performing over 100 shows per year.

You find yourself humming them, whistling them, and singing a verse to a friend. Like the songs of Woody Guthrie, they\u2019re becoming part of America.\u201d Pete goes on: \u201cIn a small village near Calcutta, in 1998, a villager who could not speak English sang me What Did You Learn In School Today? in Bengali! Tom Paxton\u2019s songs are reaching around the world more than he is, or any of us could have realized. Keep on, Tom!\u201d\n\nGuy Clark adds: \u201cThirty years ago Tom Paxton taught a generation of traditional folksingers that it was noble to write your own songs, and, like a good guitar, he just gets better with age.\u201d Paxton has been an integral part of the songwriting and folk music community since the early 60\u2019s Greenwich Village scene, and continues to be a primary influence on today\u2019s \u201cNew Folk\u201d performers. The Chicago native came to New York via Oklahoma, which he considers to be his home state. His family moved there in 1948, when Tom was 10 years old, and he graduated from Bristow High School and The University of Oklahoma, where he majored in drama while his interest in folk music grew and eventually predominated.\n\nBrought to New York courtesy of the US Army, Tom remained there following his discharge. His early success in Greenwich Village coffeehouses, such as The Gaslight and The Bitter End, led to an ever-increasing circle of work. Then in 1965 he made his first tour of the United Kingdom \u2014 the beginning of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included at least one tour in each of the succeeding years.\n\nHe and his late wife, Midge, have two daughters, Jennifer and Kate. All three women have served as inspiration for many songs, and now three grandsons, Christopher, Sean, and Peter are adding to the sources of inspiration.\n\nHe has performed thousands of concerts around the world in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Hong Kong, Scandinavia, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, England, Scotland, Ireland and Canada. That these fans still enjoy his work is a testament to the quality of his recent work, and to the enduring power of modern standards like The Last Thing On My Mind, Ramblin\u2019 Boy, Bottle Of Wine, Whose Garden Was This?, Goin\u2019 To The Zoo and The Marvelous Toy. Paxton\u2019s songbooks, critically acclaimed children\u2019s books (available from HarperCollins \u2013 see the page for children), award-winning children\u2019s recordings, and a catalog of hundreds of songs (recorded by artists running the gamut from Willie Nelson to Placido Domingo), all serve to document Tom Paxton\u2019s 40-year career.\n\nTom received a 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy during the 51st Annual GRAMMY\u00ae Awards. He was nominated for a GRAMMY for Comedians and Angels in 2007, and Live in the U.K. in 2006. He was also nominated for GRAMMYS in 2003 for his Appleseed Records CD, Looking For The Moon, and in 2002 for his children\u2019s CD, Your Shoes, My Shoes. He has received the Lifetime Achievement Award from ASCAP, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the BBC in London.\n\nTom Paxton\u2019s place in folk music is secured not just by hit records and awards, but by the admiration of three generations of fellow musicians. An internationally recognized and loved cultural figure, he has always chosen goodwill over commercial success. His generosity has taken the shape of a benefit concert performance for a little girl fighting leukemia, or a personal note of encouragement to an up-and-coming songwriter. This is the man who wrote and lives the words, \u201cPeace will come, and let it begin with me.\u201d\n\nHe is one of the great songwriters of the last century and will be reckoned as one of the greats in this new century, as well. He is a man we have come to regard as our friend.\n\n\u201cTom Paxton\u2019s songs are so powerful and lyrical, written from the heart and the conscience, and they reach their mark, our most inner being. He writes stirring songs of social protest and gentle songs of love, each woven together with his personal gift for language. His melodies haunt, his lyrics reverberate. I have sung Tom\u2019s songs for three decades and will go on doing so in the new century, for they are beautiful and timeless, and meant for every age.\u201d (Judy Collins)\n\n\u201cTom Paxton embodies the spirit of folk music in the most beautiful sense. Not just in his song crafting, his work ethic, his politics and his dedication to people\u2019s music, but also in his kind and generous heart. When I first started playing folk festivals, I was all of eighteen, shaved headed and politically outspoken. Many people in the folk community at that time seemed defensive and threatened by me, but I remember Tom was a notable exception. He was nothing but warm, welcoming and supportive to me from the git go. He\u2019s the coolest.\u201d (Ani DiFranco)\n\n\u201cEvery folk singer I know has either sung a Tom Paxton song, is singing a Tom Paxton song or will soon sing a Tom Paxton song.

Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant. The song Ginger Ale and Lorna Doones is a masterpiece, a hard hitting gut punch on every level- voice, melody, words, performance, instrumentation. I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "Tom Paxton and The DonJuans"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Teeyam", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors 8 // Show 8:30 // ALL SALES ARE FINAL // Under 21 must buy $5 drink ticket at the door\nAll doors & show times subject to change."}, {"Address": "1419 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Latin Breeze", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433317, 37.782618], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Sheba Piano Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Latin Breeze at Sheba Piano Lounge: Don't let the hokey exterior fool you, this place offers a comfortable, even classy setting in the heart of the Fillmore.

This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint. She continues to tour and record as well as remaining a strong presence in her community, working with local youth as a vocal coach and mentor. She encourages them to follow their dreams to sing freely and wholeheartedly. -Written by Elle K. Productions 9x award-winning R&B/Soul music artist.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

A 7\" and a few extra songs for a split 7\" were recorded with Fireside\u00b4s mastermind Pelle Gunnerfelt (Fireside, Hives, Breach) in the spring of 1998.\n\nIn March 1999 Switchblade recorded their groundbreaking and very well received 10\". This time with a newly recruited 2:nd bassplayer/singer. The 10\" was recorded by Breach\u00b4s mastermind Anders Ekstr\u00f6m. The 10\" turned out very chaotic and fast in tempo. A few months later a few more songs were recorded by Anders Ekstr\u00f6m and those songs ended up as the split 7\"\u00b4s with Cult of Luna and The Jam Session. Then in late 1999 Switchblade took the decision to go on as a three-piece.\n\nDuring 2000 and 2001, switchblade recorded 2 albums together once again with Breach\u00b4s Anders Ekstr\u00f6m turning the knobs. Switchblade toured both Sweden (with Cult of Luna) and Europe (twice) in support of the albums.\n\nThen in March 2003, Switchblade recorded their third selftitled full length album. The album was a 6 song, 47 minute sonic journey that ranged from subtle ambient soundscapes to monotonous, dark, instrumental passages to full on stoner flirting, yet epic heaviness. All with just sparse use of vocals. Previously having had some problems in truly capturing their sound and dynamics on tape, Switchblade turned to Carl Wikman at EAR Studios who is known for his big and true to nature sounding recordings. The album turned out to be the most powerful and focused material so far, and showcased a huge leap forward in the never ending evolution of Switchblade\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds sound and songwriting. The album received great reveiws both in Europe and in the US, where the album was released by Jake Banon\u00b4s (CONVERGE) Deathwish/Icarus imprint. A 4 week European tour in support of the album took place in early 2004 and a shorter tour took place in the summer of 2004 based around an apperance at the legendary Ieper Festival in Belgium.\n\nIn May 2004 Switchblade wanted to try out some new song ideas and approaches so they packed the gear and headed down to the Mission Hall studio located in the countryside in the south of Sweden. The weekend worth of recording together with Mattias Old\u00e9n from LOGH resulted in a 2 track 7\" with guestvocals and guitar, on one of the songs, by Mathias Friberg of LOGH. The 2 songs showed, by far, the most dynamic Switchblade material to that date.\n\nCome late summer of 2005, Switchblade packed up their gear and headed down to Mission Hall Studio once again. Having felt so relaxed and enjoyed working with Mathias Old\u00e9n, the choice was easy when picking a studio for the recording of the fourth selftitled Switchblade album. The 43+ minutes album consists of 2 long tracks and sees the band more dynamic than ever before. Insted of a constant wall of sound and riffing, every riff and every tone get alot of space and time to \"breathe\". To add further bleakness, beauty and depth to the album there\u00b4s guestvocals by \"E\" of swedish blackmetal band WATAIN and once again, guestvocals and guitar by Mattias Friberg of LOGH.\n\nThe tempo of the songs has slowed down for each release and the vocals has taken a more subtle place in the music and more instrumental passages has been brought forward to create a very dark and almost instrumental soundtrack to the apocalypse.\n\nSwitchblade are currently working on their 5th seftitled album to be recorded in the autumn of 2008.", "otherInfo": "CYBERDELIA: 25 YEARS OF HACKERS\nMovie screening at 7:30pm; dance party after, in all four rooms!\nHosted by:\nMC \"The Plague\" Kingfish (Hubba Hubba Revue)\n\u2022 Hackers costume contest at 10:30pm!\n\u2022 Head-to-head Wipeout XL competition throughout the night!\n\u2022 The Cyberdelia Gogo Dancers!\n\u2022 Rollerblades welcome...\nCostume contest prizes include hand-crafted cosplay reproductions by Hackers Curator!\nFollowed by DJs in all four rooms:\nMad Tribe\nBotnek\nMad Maxx plus surprise guest!\nSwitchblade\nWichdokta\nRandom\nAbove DNA:\nPsynthetic\nIrina Mikhailova (Live)\nDoctor Spook\nDJ Murli\nHardkore Nate\nAlex Holmes\nLounge:\nTripsitter\nGypsy Kid\nJvck Blvck\nKoby\nDazzle Room:\nMade of The Moon (audio/visual immersive experience)\n\"Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends.

A philosophy derived from the Japanese art of repairing cracked ceramics with gold to highlight flaws instead of hiding them, kintsugi speaks to the way an object's history is part of its aesthetic value. \"Considering what we were going through internally, and with what a lot of the lyrics are about, it had a great deal of resonance for us \u2014 the idea of figuring out how to repair breaks and make them a thing of beauty,\" says bassist Nick Harmer, who suggested the name to singer-guitarist Ben Gibbard and drummer Jason McGerr. \"Philosophically, spiritually, emotionally, it seems perfect for this group of songs.\"\nLong before they gave the album its name, the band embarked on a process that forced them to do things differently than they ever had before. For instance, in the course of making their seven previous albums, the Seattle band hadn't written much in the studio together. They had always preferred to hone their arrangements separately, or with just two or three of them playing at once. But when it came time to record Kintsugi, Death Cab for Cutie went into the studio with the openest of minds. Their willingness to try anything \u2014 including a twenty-minute exploration that evolved into one of the album's finest tracks, \"The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive\" \u2014 yields Death Cab's most compelling new work in years: an album that packs as much sonic as it does emotional wallop.\nKintsugi is the band's first time recording with a producer other than their own Chris Walla, the guitarist and multi-instrumentalist whose talents behind the board had helped shape Death Cab's sound since Gibbard released the You Can Play These Songs With Chords cassette in 1997. For Kintsugi, they worked with Rich Costey (whose production credits include albums by Franz Ferdinand, Muse, and Interpol), recording at his Los Angeles studio Eldorado over the course of twelve weeks in the first half of 2014. \"He was all in in a way that I don't think a lot of producers are nowadays,\" says Gibbard. \"We couldn't have landed on a better collaborator for this record. He accomplished what we've always attempted, which is to make Death Cab sound on a record how we sound live. And we're a rock band live. The difficulty now for the live show is making them rock as hard as they rock on the record. That's a new quagmire for this band.\"\nWork on Kintsugi began back in early 2013, as all Death Cab LPs have, with Gibbard writing and demoing the songs on his own before arranging and recording them with his band mates. They initially convened in fall of 2013 at Walla's Hall Of Justice studio in Seattle. Ten days into recording, Chris decided to step down as producer. Says Gibbard. \"Nothing dramatic, he just said, 'I don't think I'm the right guy to do this album and we should find someone else.'\" The band all felt that they needed to shake things up a bit. \"We challenged each other more and left no stone unturned. That was as gratifying as it was frustrating at times, but I couldn't be happier with the end product,\" says McGerr. Walla has since decided to leave the band but participated in the recording process as fully and vitally as he had on their previous albums. In fact, Costey didn't even know Walla was leaving the band until after Kintsugi was finished. Chris played his final show with the band in September at Rifflandia Festival in British Columbia.\nWhen they started recording, there weren't any rules at all. They'd work on a song for a while and then regroup with Costey to figure out elements to expand or elaborate. \"These guys have a chemistry that's existed for a long time, and that chemistry can't be ignored,\" says Costey. \"When you have a band that can play as well as they can play with each other, having them jam together in real time can actually be the quickest way to try a bunch of ideas and get them on tape.\" Songs such as the instantly memorable \"Good Help (Is So Hard To Find),\" the warm and vulnerable \"Little Wanderer\" and the brooding lead single \"Black Sun\" were all tracked with the four members of the band playing together in a room, reacting to each other in real time, adding layers \u2014 and later subtracting some. \"All four of us being on the floor together in the studio was something that hadn't happened in years, because Chris was always behind the glass or in the control room,\" says McGerr. \"But this was more like when we're onstage, where everyone has their eyes closed and we're playing in the moment. With 'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive,' it turned into a twenty-minute thing they captured in the control room on a two-track. We had started it in Seattle months prior and it just wasn't getting there. Rich brought us into the control room and was like, 'This is our song.'\"\nCostey credits another element of their production set-up with helping achieve the perfect balance of their classic approach and the new one: \"My studio has one big live recording space and two control rooms,\" he says. \"Once we got basic tracks together, Chris would work on them in the other control room. And he would end up doing completely different versions of the songs. For 'Black Sun,' Chris did all this super old school sequenced synth stuff that we used on the final track, and it really brought that song to another level.\"\n\"Black Sun\" is also a perfect example of Gibbard's customarily honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. \"'Black Sun' is about divorce and the ugliness and conflicting emotions that come with that: anger, sadness, finger-pointing, acceptance, forgiveness, understanding. To me, the idea of a black sun has multiple meanings: The black sun could be an eclipse, where one thing eclipses another. The sun is supposed to be a radiating light on the world but in this instance it is blacked out. We've all been that at some point in our life when we're supposed to be shining upon someone giving them support, but for some reason are unable to do that. I am the black sun, and the song is as much an indictment of myself as anything.\"\nAlthough, in the case of \"Black Sun,\" Gibbard says he's willing to elaborate on the elements of the song that are autobiographical, he's never been one to reveal the precise meaning behind his lyrics. \"I know that people will assume these songs are about certain things, and in some instances they are going to be correct,\" he says. \"But I'm not going to give people a road map.\"\nGibbard acknowledges that, early on in the process of writing this group of songs, as he was still trying to make sense of the major changes happening in his life, he had to remind himself not to change his creative process. \"If there's a reason people can relate to my songwriting, maybe it's they feel like they're getting an honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. I'm certainly not going to censor that just because people think they know something about my personal life. I would be cowardly as a songwriter and not be true to what I've always done if I shy away from these events in my life because I was in relationship with a public figure.\n\"I know the lyrics aren't 100% fiction and they're not 100% nonfiction, and only Ben knows what that blend is,\" says Harmer. \"But with this group of songs, I do think he is writing from a genuinely vulnerable and honest place and I'm proud of him for putting himself out there and being fearless about it.\"\nOne of the songs on Kintsugi that Gibbard says he holds closest to his heart is \"Little Wanderer,\" where he sings, \"You sent a photo out of your window of Paris of what you wished that I could see. But someone's gotta be the lighthouse and that someone's gotta be me.\" He explains: \"There are innumerable songs about, like, 'The road ain't no place to start a family.' 'Home Sweet Home' by Motley Crue, 'Gone Til November,' by Wyclef Jean, and so on. But nobody ever writes a song about sitting at home, waiting for someone to come back. And for so much of my life, I've been the one off somewhere in the world trying to maintain a connection through digital portals. Now, being with someone who travels pretty much all the time, I feel like I've gotten a taste of my own medicine. All the songs are personal, but that one is personal in a way that is very tender to me.\"\nHere, too, \"The Ghosts of Beverly Drive\" encapsulates important elements of the album's larger theme \u2014 embracing flaws and being open to change. \"If only you had known me before the accident,\" it begins, \"for with that grand collision came a grave consequence.\" Says Gibbard: \"There's this charade you play with someone when you start seeing each other, that no one has ever made you feel this way before,\" says Gibbard. \"'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive' is about when you say to the person you're with, 'Let's just acknowledge that we are not the first people to feel this way. Let's be honest with each other that we've been in love before or that we've fallen out of love with people before, and that's OK.'\"", "otherInfo": "Ben Gibbard Solo Show, Support: Johnathan Rice"}, {"Address": "525 W Santa Clara St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "LANCO", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9503543.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.903104, 37.33276], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "SAP Center At San Jose", "moreBioInfo": "The better you understand where someone comes from, the better you can understand who they are.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "853 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Tino Drima", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7830413.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421068, 37.759319], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Doo-wop Rock Basically Idk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Amnesia Beer & Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Tino Drima is a cauldron of then, now, and what will be.

This lineup quickly made a name for themselves through a series of chaotic shows in and out of town. OUT. had self released a five song cassette demo that had been well received, so with considerable momentum behind them the band entered Melody Hill Farms Recording Studio on Derby Day 1996 to record their debut album.

Chad and Dave set about searching for a new rhythm section, a task that took them from Louisville to Richmond, VA and back. This new OUT. lineup would feature Matt Odenweller on drums, Greg Livingston on second guitar and a revolving door of a bass position that would be filled by a number of individuals. The next few years saw the band return to Louisville, the release of their debut album, the recording and release of a three song seven inch, plus a couple more tours.

First off, I love songs. I love pop songs, folk songs, jazz, soul, and rock songs. I write whatever kind of song gets my point across most clearly. My point, usually, is about the miraculous, ridiculous, confusing joy of being alive.\n\nI love American pop music from every decade (Louis Armstrong to Beyonce), any folk music with guts (Nick Lowe, Patty Griffin), and just about anything that swings, grooves, or rocks (Billie Holiday, The Band, Donny Hathaway, Elvis Costello). Contenders for my favorite song of all time include \"Do You Know What it Means to Miss New Orleans?\", \"Suzanne\", and \"F**k You\".\n\nI believe that music is magic, and everybody needs it. That\u2019s why I give mine away.\n\nI live in a pink house in New Orleans. I\u2019ve got two dogs and a studio out back called The Watermelon. I grew up on a defunct cattle farm in Luray, Virginia. At sixteen I fled the coop to Eugene, Oregon. I cut my musical teeth in Philadelphia. I\u2019ve played shows in most of North America and Europe, and soon, Australia. I\u2019ve toured with Paul Simon, The Wood Brothers, and The Weepies. I ran a crazy-successful Kickstarter campaign. I\u2019m an unschooler, a sex blogger, and a Lindy Hopper.

Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant. The song Ginger Ale and Lorna Doones is a masterpiece, a hard hitting gut punch on every level- voice, melody, words, performance, instrumentation. I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "Email Kristin @ herowana@icloud.com for rsvp and information"}, {"Address": "1350 3rd St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Jefferson Starship", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8387055.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.287516, 38.296479], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Folk Rock, Classic Rock, Psychedelic Rock Acid Rock, Folk Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Acid Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Uptown Theatre Napa", "moreBioInfo": "Paul Kantner founded Jefferson Airplane in 1965. The Airplane were the biggest rock group in America during the 1960s and the first San Francisco band to sign a major record deal, paving the way for other legends like Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin. They headlined the original Woodstock Festival in 1969 and, like The Beatles with whom they are critically compared, lasted a mere 7 years, though their influence and impact on rock music continues well into the 21st century. In 1974 Mr. Kantner created Jefferson Starship and again enjoyed chart-topping success. Paul and Jefferson Airplane were inducted into The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the same year as Pink Floyd.\n\nJefferson Starship, the name created by Kantner for his 1971 solo debut \u201cBlows Against The Empire\u201d recording, has endured 40 years as one of rock\u2019s most legendary bands. That recording was the first and only to ever be nominated for literary science fiction\u2019s Hugo Award \u2026 a stellar achievement.\n\nCo- founder David Freiberg also started the legendary Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Fillmore era San Francisco band who often shared the bill with the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane.

Chris has gone on to place music in film and television including the #1 rated series \u201cCSI.\u201d In 2000 he assumed the seeming impossible task of playing piano and (synth) bass simultaneously \u2026 a feat only duplicated by the legendary Ray Manzarek of the Doors.

Her professional credits include fronting her own successful rock band, producing and releasing seven albums on various indie record labels. She was nominated for a GRAMMY Award for Art Direction of her band\u2019s 2003 release, \u201cThe Road to Bliss,\u201d which also received two DIY Awards (Do It Yourself in Film, Books and Music) for Album Art of the Year and Producer of the Year.

A longtime sailor, Legg also notes that \u201ca lot of my childhood memories are of me and my dad on this little tiny boat, cruising around the New England coast. I spent countless hours just sailing and listening to music, and the feeling of that experience has stayed with me really heavily over the years.\u201d Throughout the album, Goldroom reveals his deep-rooted affinity with the ocean by sculpting expansive arrangements and instilling each song with a serene yet kinetic energy.\n\nThat energy\u2019s partly sourced from Goldroom\u2019s ingenuity in interlacing live guitar, bass, and percussion into electronic soundscapes to form a sound both forward-pushing and timeless. On West of the West, he further shapes that glossy but groove-heavy sound by tapping into sensibilities of early French house music. \u201cI don\u2019t feel all that influenced by producers on a day-to-day basis\u2014songwriting is what\u2019s important to me, so I\u2019m usually thinking about guys like Tom Petty or Curtis Mayfield\u2014but there\u2019s an innocence to what producers like Daft Punk and Alan Braxe do that appeals to me,\u201d says Legg. And just as those artists show an intense fascination with the pop landscape of the early \u201980s, Goldroom steeps West of the West in its own nostalgia. \u201cI\u2019ve always used music as an escapist device, as a way to try to get back to that feeling of when you were younger and everything was a little more pure and uncomplicated,\u201d he points out.\n\nOn the album-opening \u201cSilhouette,\u201d for instance, Goldroom brilliantly channels the breezy and bass-powered feel of classic French touch music. Slow-building and warmly intimate, the song bittersweetly muses on \u201cwhat it means to be far away from someone you love and feeling like part of you is missing without them,\u201d as Legg explains.\n\nFrom start to finish West of the West sustains that dreamy melancholy, a mood informed by Legg\u2019s solo touring as a DJ in recent years. \u201cBeing alone on the road for long stretches of time is a pretty unique experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s this dual thing of loving that lifestyle of constantly being in motion, but also missing my family and my friends and feeling pulled back home. That\u2019s definitely something I kept coming back to as I was writing for this record.\u201d Trading off vocals with Irish singer/songwriter Rooty throughout West of the West, Goldroom brings a nuanced emotionality to songs like \u201cBack to You\u201d (a sweetly shimmering feel-good track), \u201cLying to You\u201d (a darkly propulsive number with all the cinematic intensity of an \u201980s pop gem), and \u201cRetrograde\u201d (a gorgeously urgent anthem driven by Rooty\u2019s powerful vocal performance).\n\nIn creating West of the West, Goldroom aimed to \u201cdig really deep and come up with something more honest and meaningful than what you usually see in dance music.\u201d Aided by his graceful grasp of songcraft, that honesty manifests itself in a spirited vitality also abundant in Goldroom\u2019s energetic live show. (Featuring a full band setup, the Goldroom live set finds Legg backed by a bassist, drummer, and fellow singer as he alternates between guitar and keys.) \u201cIt\u2019s a lot different from older Goldroom stuff, where my primary concern was whether or not the song was going to work on a dance floor,\u201d Legg adds in reflecting on West of the West.\n\nDebuting with the Angeles EP in 2011, Goldroom emerged soon after the dissolution of Legg\u2019s former band NightWaves. \u201cI\u2019d been writing all these songs but had no outlet for them, so people suggested I start a solo thing,\u201d recalls Legg, who borrowed the name Goldroom from a dive bar in Echo Park (\u201ca good place to get drunk and find answers to all of life\u2019s hardest questions\u201d). Though Goldroom was born from his then-burgeoning infatuation with the electronic world, the project drew closely from Legg\u2019s near-lifelong experience in making music. Raised in Wellesley, Massachusetts, he learned to play cello and guitar as a child and soon started writing his own songs and self-recording on a four-track. At age 15 he had a major musical awakening while teaching sailing on Cape Cod, where a group of college kids turned him on to the \u201960s/\u201970s rock and folk artists who would eventually guide his own songwriting. After heading off to study at the University of Southern California, Legg discovered Air, Daft Punk, and other electronic artists whose music \u201cmade me feel things I didn\u2019t know that I could feel.\u201d He then began his journey toward crafting boldly inventive electronic music with a classic-pop songwriting structure at its core.\n\nFor Goldroom, the main thrill of West of the West is his success in \u201cmaking a record where I could sit down with an acoustic guitar, play the album all the way through, and still make it work.\u201d But while each song is strong enough to stand unadorned, West of the West\u2019s lush and luminous production ultimately lends the album an even greater emotional depth. \u201cThere\u2019s something really incredible about beautiful chords being played using a stack of nicely tuned synthesizers,\u201d Legg says in discussing his passion for electronic music. \u201cAnd with a drum machine, you can make a kick-drum sound that\u2019s more impactful than any real kick drum. There\u2019s a whole world out there with electronic music, and the thing that gets me most excited as a musician is finding new ways to paint with those palettes while still telling a very human story.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3049 20th Street at Alabama , San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Darryl Kniffen", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9142313.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.41092, 37.75903], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Jazz Fusion, Jazz Instrument", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Atlas Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "Drummer/composer/educator Darryl Kniffen leads the Billboard-charting jazz fusion group Planet Kniffen.

Having inspired countless other musicians, Dave has worked in many genres that typically blend instrumental pop, R&B and lately, more and more traditional jazz. He released his first solo album Taking Off in 1975, but has been playing the saxophone since before he was in high school when he was inspired by the great Chicago blues artists near his hometown of St. Louis.\nHaving contracted polio at the age of three, Dave was introduced to the saxophone as part of his treatment therapy. By the age of 14, he was able to play with legends such as Albert King and Little Milton. Dave went on to study music at Northwestern University before transferring to the University of Iowa where he played and studied with the great saxophonist JR Monterose.\nLater traveling to California on the advice of a friend, he joined the Butterfield Blues Band and played Woodstock with Paul Butterfield. Following that, Dave toured with Stevie Wonder and recorded for Wonder\u2019s Talking Book album, played with The Rolling Stones, and toured with David Bowie with whom he recorded the famous solo heard on \u201cYoung Americans.\u201d At the same time, Dave was touring and recording with the great Gil Evans, dividing his time between the two. After moving to New York City and studying with George Coleman, Dave started his solo career where he later collaborated with such artists as Paul Simon and James Taylor.\nDave\u2019s solo release of Taking Off in 1975\u2014still considered a classic\u2014further solidified his career. His 1979 release of Hideaway became a popular hit and further propelled Dave\u2019s ascent with the single, \u201cSeduction\u201d being featured in the movie, American Gigolo. Veteran bassist and composer Marcus Miller joined Dave on the 1981 album, Voyeur. The single, \u201cAll I Need Is You\u201d won Dave his first Grammy Award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance. In 1983, Dave released the hit album Backstreet that included Luther Vandross as a featured guest vocalist. Later albums have included guest artists such as Jack DeJohnette, Bill Frisell, Charlie Hayden, Wallace Roney, Kenny Barron, Christian McBride, and Eric Clapton.\nMoving onto television, Dave hosted the show, Night Music, from 1988 to 1990.\nProduced by Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels, the show featured films of jazz legends like Thelonious Monk, Dave Brubeck and Billie Holiday, as well as banter and memorable music jams by a remarkable list of musicians including Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, Joe Sample, Pharoah Sanders, and many others. Additionally, Dave had regularly hosted the After New Year's Eve TV special on ABC. During the 1980s and 1990s, Dave hosted a syndicated radio program, The Jazz Show with David Sanborn. Dave has also recorded many shows' theme songs as well as several other songs for The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder.\nIn his four-and-a-half decade career, Dave continues to be one of the most highly active musicians of his genre, performing over 100 shows per year.

In a style nearly impossible to describe using the terms of conventional genres, she playfully blends Brazilian samba, bossa nova and Tropic\u00e1lia with Classical harmony, the sincerity and thoughtfulness of singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Harry Nilsson, and the full-bodied rhythms of 1970\u2019s pop and r&b. \u201cBy combining elements of surreal, personal narratives and her quasi-Brazilian-style strum, Adron\u2019s songs [are] at once baroque and hypnotic,\u201d writes music critic Chad Radford at Creative Loafing. Adron\u2019s music is infused with an international texture and a remarkably vintage, yet completely original and personal sound. While able to craft polished and mature songs, she also possesses a bold and often bizarre sense of humor that she manages to sneak into her lyrics. Adron also adds a unique array of embellishments such as birdcalls and other vocalizations, and sings eloquently in three languages. Musically, she seems almost oblivious to her upbringing as a suburban Chicago native and longtime Atlanta resident, instead floating in a musical ether of exotic influences. Though the music pleases effortlessly, it is Adron\u2019s rare ability to meld genre, geography and musical epochs that reveal the true breadth of her talent. \u201cBorn as it is out of a true love for tradition, Adron\u2019s inclusion of world music elements never feels trite or tacked on; her music is as warm and spirited as the cultures that have inspired it.\u201d -Flagpole, Athens, GA She is often touring across the US, playing alongside artists like Toubab Krewe, Reggie Watts, Reptar, Space Trucks (Of Montreal side project), Cate Le Bon, and Bright Black Morning Light.

De esta forma nace una leyenda que perdurara en las paginas de la historia musical de Latinoam\u00e9rica; una agrupaci\u00f3n que fundo una lucha pacifica por la paz de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas y una agrupaci\u00f3n que sigue existiendo en los corazones de aquellos que siguen luchando por la superaci\u00f3n de Guatemala.\n\n\nEste es el grupo con m\u00e1s historia en nuestro pa\u00eds, sus influencias son del rock cl\u00e1sico mezclado con instrumentos aut\u00f3ctonos.\n\nALUX NAHUAL (El Esp\u00edritu del Duende en lengua Maya-Quiche) es sin lugar a dudas el grupo de rock en espa\u00f1ol m\u00e1s exitoso en la historia de Centro Am\u00e9rica, afirmaci\u00f3n que se respalda con creces, gracias a 20 a\u00f1os de notable presencia en la escena musical del istmo, 10 exitosos LP's, todo tipo de reconocimientos y cientos de conciertos que han dejado una huella indeleble en la juventud centroamericana.\n\nSin duda, el grupo de rock m\u00e1s importante de su tiempo en Centroam\u00e9rica, y esto se debe a su sincron\u00eda en el tiempo y el espacio. Naci\u00f3 en Guatemala, pero toda C.A. lo tom\u00f3 como propio, parec\u00eda revivir el \"antiguo\" sue\u00f1o de una Centro Am\u00e9rica unida. Alto al fuego se escuchaba en las monta\u00f1as y en las fiestas de la ciudad. La m\u00fasica de Alux no reconoci\u00f3 partidos, colores de uniforme, ni razas.

Alux Nahual fue el primer grupo \"concertista\" de Centro Am\u00e9rica, ya que antes de su aparici\u00f3n, s\u00f3lo exist\u00edan grupos que amenizaban bailes populares. Tambi\u00e9n han sido pioneros en muchos aspectos, empezando por su estilo \u00fanico que a lo largo de su historia ha integrado instrumentos no tradicionales en este tipo de m\u00fasica como el Cello, la Flauta Dulce, el Saxof\u00f3n, la arm\u00f3nica, el Palo de Agua, las Guitarras Ac\u00fasticas y otros m\u00e1s.

Repopulate Mars, ViVA Music, Toolroom and more have all recognised Brown\u2019s raw, sometimes caustic talent: if you\u2019re looking for dance music with character, you\u2019re in the right place.\n\nHaving moved with enviable ease between these two distinct musical scenes, Eli Brown\u2019s talent in merging the weighty Bristolian bass lines of his D&B past with the classic vocal hooks and caustic synth melodies of house music has been a runaway success, with his unique take on club music already finding its place as a dancefloor staple.\n\nWith such an assured house catalogue already under his belt its easy to forget that Brown is a newcomer to the scene, having only made his debut in December 2016 with Can You Feel It / Acid Test on Skream\u2019s Of Unsound Mind imprint \u2013 an artist who knows more than most the challenges of switching between genres. This debut outing led to both a follow up EP Got The Power EP in April 2017 as well as a collaboration with Skream himself on Lagos.\n\nWith labels like Steve Lawler\u2019s Viva Music (3am EP May 2017), Toolroom Records and Lee Foss\u2019s Repopulate Mars championing Brown, he continues to both gain support from established figures in the house world and find his music resonating with fans: his 2017 track Sumatra released on Toolroom in late 2017 was one of the biggest selling tracks of the year.\n\nAirplay of 4/4 sub-bouncer 'Acid Test' from BBC Radio 1 tastemakers Annie Mac and Monki, and A-list DJs Groove Armada, Leftwing & Kody and Solardo on Rinse FM have further enhanced the standing of Brown and his music, with the result that labels are now falling over themselves to sign his records. The first few months of 2018 along sees releases with Lee Foss\u2019s Repopuate Mars, Green Velvet\u2019s Relief, Solardo\u2019s Sola and elrow: an impressive roll call by anyone\u2019s standards\n\nFebruary 2018 also see Brown make his debut at arguably the world\u2019s greatest club fabric, an incredible endorsement given his relative newbie status in house music and further proof \u2013 if any was needed \u2013 that he is right at the cutting edge of electronic music.

He\u2019s a natural performer who engages crowds with charm and a smile. An obsessive music collector, Atish pulls from a broad sonic palette, and with these sounds he creates intimate atmospheres and emotional experiences that linger in your mind long after the music has stopped.\n\nAtish\u2019s passion goes far beyond the decks as well. As cofounder of the Manjumasi record label, he has created an outlet for other artists\u2019 music as well as his own productions. His work has also found a home on prestigious imprints such as Anjunadeep, Kindisch, and Stil Vor Talent.\n\nAs a pertinent voice in the electronic scene, Atish has also hosted his own Late Night Tonite! Party series, which combines a sit-down talk show interview with an all-night dance party. This format provides a richer context for the music and strengthens the emotional bonds between the audience and the artist. For Atish, it allows him to experiment with what dance music is and what it can be.\n\nIntimacy and connection are the foundations of the Atish experience. His multiple residencies speak to Atish\u2019s ability to resonate with any crowd and highlight the range of his sound. From the blissed-out festival vibes of Desert Hearts, to the big city sophistication of New York\u2019s The Cityfox Experience, and the small club coziness of Miami\u2019s Do Not Sit On The Furniture, Atish brings people together with music and passion.\n\nThis passion can be heard on Atish\u2019s numerous DJ mixes found on Soundcloud. A prolific mixer, Atish finds the DJ mix the perfect format to create compelling narratives of rhythm and sound. Scrolling through his extensive catalog of mixes, one can hear an artist devoted to the music and dedicated to the perfection of his craft. It\u2019s the same devotion Atish receives back from crowds and fans the world over. They understand it\u2019s more than the music and the crowd and the DJ, it\u2019s the magic that awakens when it all comes together.\n\nAtish\u2019s ability to create a special atmosphere is perfectly summarized through his Atish All Night series. With full creative control over the venue, sound, decoration, and music, the party encompasses all that Atish has come to love about dance music through his illustrious career.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "DJ Jamy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9973751.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Second Life - FFF - Sexy Saturdays", "moreBioInfo": "SecondLife and Real World DJ", "otherInfo": "https://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Cargo City/119/70/24"}, {"Address": "224 Vintage Wy, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "Blame Sally", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6047979.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.55345, 38.088411], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Rock, Acoustic, Rock, On Indie Edges Of Americana, Eclectic, Folk", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "Hopmonk Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cBlame Sally has suddenly burst out of the pack as a Bay Area phenomenon, selling out shows, winning over new fans, enjoying tremendous response to their third CD, \"Severland,\" a collection of \"eclectic folk pop\" songs that are personal, playful and political.\u201d \u2013Paul Liberatore, Marin IJ\n\n\"An amazing collection of talented local musicians has banded together and released a stunning new CD. \"Severland,\" the latest from San Francisco's Blame Sally, should bring this female foursome universal acclaim .

Couple that with all their music friends joining in on the fun, and this new CD makes a very strong case for Northern California being the new torch-bearing center of the classic Chicago and Texas blues sound.\nSix stellar originals tell the couple\u2019s individual and combined personal histories in an honest and cosmic way. Beth & RW\u2019s love of the classic blues vibe pays off and yet, these songs could easily be covered by well-known singers in many roots music idioms.\nNestled alongside are songs by their mid-20th century heroes Jimmy Reed (lead track, \u201cThere\u2019ll Be a Day\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t That Loving You Baby\u201d), Memphis Minnie (\u201cLookin\u2019 the World Over\u201d), Big Bill Broonzy (\u201cLonesome Road Blues\u201d), jump blues brother-sister act, Buddy & Ella Johnson (\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Stop It\u201d) and Memphis Slim (\u201cMother Earth.\u201d)\nRed\u2019s Blues has a finger-poppin\u2019 attitude\u2014straight outta the afore-mentioned golden years when blues, R&B and swing all meshed together and dance floors every night were filled with snake hips and slow drags. Beth, with her sensual, southern voice and classy behind-the-beat phrasing is more a Julie London or Bobbie Gentry-styled singer: smoky with languid, sexy sophistication. She can swing too, just check out the big fun on \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Ya Stop It.\u201d This rich nightclub feel is missed on too many modern singers. The yearning confidentiality, the wise heart that Beth brings to her true-life stories reveal tales of youth seen through grown up reflection.\nRW, who has not lost his hometown Rome, Georgia accent has this quality also. Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is back at the Poor House Bistro with Special Guest Sid Morris on piano.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

She is a virtuoso, she is expressive, spontaneous and with a grace that makes her the favorite of all of us.\u201d Chucho Vald\u00e9s\n\nYilian Ca\u00f1izares is one of the most intriguing contemporary violinists, singers and composers. Always staying true to her origins, she skillfully blends jazz, classical and Afro-Cuban rhythms with her otherworldly voice. Whether on stage or in a recording studio, there are few talented artists like Yilian \u2013 who was born in Havana and settled in Switzerland \u2013 with such great respect for the past and sensitivity towards the future, accompanied by a smile to die for.\n\nTwo acclaimed albums, the self-produced \u201cOchumare\u201d released in 2013 and its 2015 follow-up \u201cInvocaci\u00f3n\u201d, under the guidance of Al\u00ea Siqueira (Roberto Fonseca, Omara Portuondo), have strengthened her reputation as an innovative artist who is capable of transcending musical boundaries.\nFrench weekly Le Nouvel Observateur called her the \u201crevelation of the year\u201d due to her charisma, influences and the ease with which Yilian sings and plays the violin.\n\u201cMy sound reflects the richness and mixture of cultures that I carry with me today. It reflects what I am: a woman, Cuban, musician and citizen of the world,\" explains the artist.\n\nWhen she was just 14 years old, Yilian Ca\u00f1izares was offered a scholarship to study in Caracas.\nIn 2000, she moved to Switzerland to study at a conservatory. After a few years, major orchestras began to request her and, after moving to Lausanne, she collaborated with several ensembles for six years. During this period, the artist created a quartet of musicians from Germany, Venezuela and Switzerland (and later Cuba) and named it \u201cOchumare\u201d. Six months later, in 2008, she won the Montreux Jazz Festival Competition with this group. Since then, her career has crescendoed.

Together with their compatriot Inor Sotolongo on percussion, the duo created an intimate, personal record that reflects the perspectives of two generations of Cuban artists who live a long way from their homeland. The album is a mix of moving songs and energetic ballads, a symbol of the incomparable musical chemistry between the two artists.\nA unique fusion between Afro-Cuban music, classical music and jazz.\n\nThe new album, \u201cErzulie\u201d, named after the Haitian goddess of love and freedom, will be released on 15th November.

Purchase & Stream at https://mannequinpussy.ffm.to/patience.\n\nThe third full-length from Mannequin Pussy, Patience is an album fascinated with the physical experience of the body, its songs tracking the movements of mouths and hands and racing hearts, skin and spit and teeth and blood. Deeply attuned to the power of their own physicality, the Philadelphia-based band channels complex emotion in blistering riffs, thrashing rhythms, vocals that feel as immediate and untamed as a gut reaction. But throughout Patience, the Philadelphia-based band contrasts that raw vitality with intricate melodies and finely detailed arrangements, building a strange and potent tension that makes the album all the more cathartic.\n\nThe follow-up to Romantic\u2014a 2016 release praised by Pitchfork for \u201ccombin[ing] punk, shoegaze, death metal, and more, with the ferocious push-pull energy of a mosh pit\u201d\u2014Patience came to life at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. In creating the album, Mannequin Pussy worked with producer/engineer Will Yip (Quicksand, The Menzingers), shaping an explosive sound that never overshadows the subtlety of their songwriting. \u201cIn the past there\u2019s been a chaotic feeling to the recording process, but working with Will put us in a different headspace,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cIt helped us show our progression over the past few years and make a very crisp-sounding record, without losing the dirtiness of what Mannequin Pussy really is.\u201d\n\nOpening with its gloriously frenetic title track, Patience matches Mannequin Pussy\u2019s wild volatility with a narrative voice that\u2019s often painfully vulnerable. On \u201cDrunk II,\u201d for instance, Dabice\u2019s vocals shift from fragile to furious, the track\u2019s stormy guitar work colliding with lyrics capturing the grief of post-breakup inertia. \u201cI wrote that song one night when I was very heartbroken, after I\u2019d been out with friends trying to pretend like I wasn\u2019t feeling so hopeless,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cI went home and just started playing guitar and crying, and stayed up working on that song till about four in the morning.\u201d\n\nOn the delicately sprawling \u201cHigh Horse,\u201d Patience takes on a more restrained tone but still maintains a devastating intensity, with Mannequin Pussy presenting an intimate portrait of an abusive relationship (\u201cPushing me up against the kitchen sink/I feel your breath on me/I can taste it in my teeth\u201d). Meanwhile, \u201cWho You Are\u201d shifts into a brightly tender mood, assuming a classic-love-song sweetness in its message of self-acceptance. \u201cI turned 30 as we were working on the record, and it changed my whole perspective on my life and relationships and everything,\u201d says Dabice. \u201c\u2018Who You Are\u2019 came from thinking about what I\u2019d want to say to myself when I was still in my 20s and wasting so much time not believing in myself.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Patience, Mannequin Pussy transmit an unstoppable fury: the 39-second \u201cClams\u201d delivers as a brutal blast of vitriol against those who\u2019ve tried to hold them back, while \u201cF.U.C.A.W.\u201d unfolds in unhinged riffs and relentlessly pounding beats. And on \u201cIn Love Again,\u201d the album closes out with a magnificently epic anthem driven by dreamy guitar tones, lilting piano melodies, and a particularly elegant performance from Reading (\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the nuanced drum beat and the percussion odyssey at the end,\u201d she notes. \u201cAnd yes, there are bongos on the track\u201d). The most undeniably hopeful moment on Patience, \u201cIn Love Again\u201d telegraphs utter joy and awe in its heart-on-sleeve lyrics. \u201cI always want our records to end in a place of optimism,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cThe songs take you on a journey through all these very toxic emotions and traumatic experiences, but what I\u2019m trying to articulate is that something good can come from getting through all that.\u201d\n\nThe push toward transformation has long propelled the songwriting of Mannequin Pussy, who formed as a duo when childhood friends Dabice and Paul reconnected after years apart. At the time, Dabice had recently returned to the East Coast from Colorado in order to help take care of her mother, who\u2019d just suffered a stroke. \u201cIt was one of the most trying times of my life, and at some point my mom suggested that I try going to therapy,\u201d Dabice recalls. \u201cBut instead I was like, \u2018I think I\u2019m just gonna learn to play guitar.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone; I just wanted to lose myself in the creative process.\u201d Once she and Paul played music together, they discovered a chemistry she now describes as magical. \u201cWe created so much in such a short period of time,\u201d Dabice says. \u201cWe never even thought of making records or anything\u2014it was just this pure emotional outlet, just us screaming onstage with our guitars.\u201d\n\nAs they continued collaborating, Dabice and Paul later added Reading and Regisford to the lineup, making their debut with GP in 2014 and releasing Romantic in fall 2016. Recently signed to Epitaph, Mannequin Pussy found themselves newly revitalized in the writing and recording of Patience, their creative connection stronger than ever. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of how hard we\u2019ve worked to get to this point,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cThis album sounds exactly how I\u2019ve always wanted us to sound\u2014I\u2019ve never listened to something we\u2019ve made and felt so inspired by it.\u201d\n\nAs Dabice explains, the band\u2019s journey toward the making of Patience partly inspired the album\u2019s title. \u201cI think you have to be patient that you\u2019ll find the sound that\u2019s in your head,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to take your time if you can\u2019t figure it out right away\u2014you\u2019ve got to just trust that you\u2019ll get there eventually.\u201d And within that process, Mannequin Pussy have continually found the emotional release that ultimately makes their music so powerful. \u201cFeeling isolated in your most toxic experiences can slowly destroy you from the inside, but going through the motion of creating something can make you feel at peace,\u201d Dabice says. \u201cAnd the real beauty is that, by sharing your experience, it helps other people to feel less alone as well. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always searched for with our music, and I don\u2019t think that will ever change for us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "25 S Livermore Ave, Livermore, CA 94550", "Artist": "Nick Tyrrel", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9116756.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.769681, 37.683011], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Tap 25", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2174 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Ada Lea", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9112820.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.430418, 37.766622], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Swedish American Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Montreal, Quebec - based musician Alexandra Levy - who records and performs as Ada Lea - is also a painter and visual artist, and traces of her many creative abilities run throughout her debut album what we say in private, a colorful collection of profound pop songs to be released July 19.\n\nTo her, music and visual art are different vessels for communicating similar ideas.

With the brightness of love, strength, and hope contrasted with the darkness of loss, suffering, isolation, and abandonment, the Ada Lea album what we say in private is a varied and vivid record that constantly seems to shift in the light, bringing together all the intricate influences she\u2019s collected over the years.\n\nBold and daring, but also gentle and vulnerable, what we say in private finds new ways of presenting its vision from one inspired idea to the next, a big leap into the wider world with passion and exuberance.", "otherInfo": "This show is all ages.

The friction between these impulses is where good things happen, and it\u2019s the place San Francisco\u2019s The Stone Foxes - spear headed by brothers Shannon Koehler (drums, harp, vocals) and Spence Koehler (lead guitar, vocals) ) - have resided since their 2008 debut, young men dedicated to keeping rock engaged and succulently alive.\n\n\u201cYou do what the song needs you to do. That\u2019s how this band does it,\u201d says Shannon. \u201cHell, that\u2019s how The Band did it! You can go back to Muddy Waters and further for examples of this. With us, there\u2019s this filter of blues and roots that we\u2019ve created by soaking up that music, and when we write everything gets put through that filter. It comes out as who we are today, but everything we do goes through that filter, this cultural fuzzbox.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s third record, Small Fires , released in February of 2013, is a cohesive, compelling distillation of all the learning the quartet has been doing on the road the past two years since 2010\u2019s Bears & Bulls, an evolution that harnesses their significant firepower with and wrestle with the idea of conflicts, big and small.\n\n\u201cFor sure it\u2019s economically and politically driven, but there are still a few relationship songs in there,\u201d chuckles Shannon. \u201cWith earlier albums, we were more concerned with how the music sounded than any underlying themes. This time we took the lyric writing to a new place. I think we\u2019re getting better at defining who we are.\u201d With producer Doug Boehm (Girls, Dr. Dog, The Vines), The Stone Foxes cut 12 songs in 12 days at Los Angeles\u2019 Carriage House, a whirlwind pace that kept things popping in real time, ideas coming fast and furious, bits of lightning captured in whatever bottle was handy.\n\nOn this past tour in support of Small Fires the Stone Foxes put action to their politically driven lyrics by teaming up with SuperFood Drive to help raise awareness of hunger and homelessness in each city they visited on tour. According to SuperFood Drive 1 out of 6 people visit a food pantry because they can\u2019t afford to buy food. 50% of these people are children. This same population also tends to suffer from obesity and chronic illness like diabetes and heart disease. At every show the band encouraged fans to bring healthy nutrient filled non-perishable food, and teamed up with a local food bank where the band personally delivered all the food that was collected at the shows.\n\nWhile working with SuperFood drive the Stone Foxes embarked on a very unique musical collaboration with food bank and food shelter patrons. \u201cThe first recording we did at a shelter was a man named Charles who had lived under a freeway\u201d reports Shannon Koehler, \u201che sang our song about cold nights in the city. After we stopped rolling, he called me over and told me how much the song meant to him. You don't forget things like that. Goose bumps and watery eyes were the norm at these sessions. At shelters on tour and at home in San Francisco, people who know hard times have sang with us and shared their stories. It's been an honor to listen. We're just trying to share their voices.\u201d These special recordings will be released in late November in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nAs for right now the Stone Foxes are focused almost solely on writing. \u201cDuring shows we'll be trying out some new stuff, \u201c says Shannon \u201cand then we'll huddle back in the studio and start cranking the stuff out. We're really excited about the sound. The rock is raw, blues is the filter.

Cash's commanding songcraft, expressive vocals and bracing guitar work make her debut solo album Gift Horse a rousing collection that showcases her pointed songwriting and the edgy musical sensibility that's been honed by extensive roadwork and onstage experience.\n\"I'd describe it as roots-rock storytelling,\" Cash says of the Independent Music Award-winning Gift Horse. \"The songs deal with love, heartbreak and various inner reflections.\"\nBeyond her solo work, Cash has also found time to maintain her membership in two notable Bay Area bands: the socially-conscious female funk-rock foursome Skip the Needle, with which she recorded the acclaimed debut album We Ain't Never Going Back; and the punchy, punk- inflected mixed-gender quartet Year of the Fist, whose three releases\u2014 the latest being 2019's Revive Me\u2014have attracted notice on the local punk scene and beyond.\n\"Being in three bands can be exhausting,\" admits Cash, \"but it's been important to me to cultivate these multiple outlets because of how I feel within each of them, and because I have a genuinely good time in all three. I do love working in such vastly different settings, because I can express various aspects of myself and my musical passions.\"\nCash's eclectic personal history has put her in a unique position to explore a wide range of musical interests. Growing up in close proximity to the Bay Area's punk, indie and skater scenes, she developed a deeply rooted sense of musical iconoclasm, absorbing punk, blues and gospel, not to mention the big band records she'd hear on her grandmother's antique hi- fi. After teaching herself to play guitar at the age of 12, she joined a series of bands, many of them female, before launching her own outfit, alternately known as Coal Pitts Wash and Dolorata. She also spent two and a half years playing with Turbonegra, an all-female tribute to the Norwegian punk band Turbonegro. She then attended Mills College's\nprestigious music program, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music Composition.\nThe lessons that Cash has learned along the way are reflected on such memorable Gift Horse tracks as the expansive \"Year Gone By,\" the haunting \"Broken Nights\" and the dynamic title track. Another highlight is Cash's vivid reading of the Patti Smith classic \"Pissing in a River.\" The album, produced by Julie Wolf (Ani DiFranco, Carly Simon, Indigo Girls), features guest appearances by acclaimed singer-songwriter Kris Delmhorst, 4 Non Blondes member Dawn Richardson and noted drummer Allison Miller.\n\"I would say Gift Horse is a chapter in a longer story,\" Cash reflects. \"The album was a vision that I had to see through to the end. Making it felt like a real achievement. It was a labor of love and a huge amount of work. I'm really proud of this record, and all of the talent, time, effort and community that went into it.\"\nWith Gift Horse now a reality after its lengthy gestation, Katie Cash encapsulates her goals thusly: \"I'm currently working with such an incredibly talented group of people. I'm focusing on bringing the music of Gift Horse to audiences through touring and performing at festivals. I will be releasing some singles in the coming year. I feel blessed, and with the same people by my side, I will continue to keep writing, creating and bringing more music into the world.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "234 Hutchins Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Shimshai", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9981435.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.817411, 38.393504], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "Genres: Acoustic, World Fusion, Spiritual, Folk, Reggae, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Subud Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Shimshai is an international performing artist drawing inspiration from many different genres including reggae, folk, and sacred traditional music to create a style that is uniquely his own and has influenced many other artists.

Unlike the previous incarnation, Brasil '66 was an instant success - making a significant impact on the charts with its first single, a version of the Brazilian song \"Mais Que Nada\". Much of the song's appeal was due to the distinctive, multi-tracked vocals of Hall.\n\nA series of popular interpretations followed, including their take on The Beatles' \"Fool on the Hill\". Though many associate her with Brasil '66's hit rendition of Burt Bacharach's \"The Look of Love\" on the album Look Around (which reached #4 on the pop charts in 1968), the lead on that single was actually handled by Mendes' other singer of that period, Janis Hansen.\n\nThe band frequently toured alongside A&M labelmates (and label founder) Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, no doubt providing plenty of opportunity for Hall and Alpert to get acquainted. She would leave Brasil '66 in 1971, but marry Alpert in 1973.\n\nWith her husband assuming production and arranging duties, Hall subsequently embarked on a solo career, beginning with 1972's Sun Down Lady and following up with Hello It's Me in 1975. A new album would appear nearly every year until 1985's Es Facil Amar, for which Hall would be awarded a Grammy for Best Latin Pop Performance. Her albums maintained their popularity, primarily in the Latin market, but some mainstream presence was kept, particularly with her contribution of the title song to the James Bond film Never Say Never Again in 1983.\n\nAfter raising a family with Alpert and writing fiction, she returned in 1998 with the album Brasil Nativo on the Windham Hill label.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Percussion", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Pianist Omar Sosa and violinist-vocalist Yilian Ca\u00f1izares have come together to create a very beautiful and personal album, AGUAS.

His influences include legendary artists such as Dr. John, the Meters, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jimi Hendrix, the Allman Brothers Band & the Grateful Dead.\n\nJones has released two full length albums. In his latest release, Keep On Movin' (2015), he turns his attention to his homeland to rediscover its rich musical heritage. The album is a nod to some of his musical heroes from New Orleans and the Deep South, and it showcases his versatility as a songwriter and a guitarist. Keep On Movin' was recorded at Light Rail Studios in San Francisco, and it boasts some of the top musicians and studio engineers in California. Jones' previous release, From Here On (2010), is an all-acoustic concept album that features a 10-piece ensemble playing a range of jazz and folk to orchestral and raga music, and it is a stylistic nod to the late Nick Drake, one of his biggest influences and musical inspirations at the time.\n\nProfessor Jones has performed at notable Bay Area venues including Boom Boom Room, The New Parish, Bottom of the Hill, Brick & Mortar, and Ashkenaz, plus festivals such as Lost Sierra Hoedown and Festival International de Louisiane. He has had the privilege of supporting notable acts like Ivan Neville\u2019s Dumpstaphunk, Eddie Roberts (The New Mastersounds), Eric McFadden (P-Funk), Stu Allen & Mars Hotel, and Dead Winter Carpenters. Jones was a guest performer in Guitarmaggedon in 2014, and he has shared the stage with virtuosos such as Dan Lebowitz (ALO), Josh Clark (Tea Leaf Green), Jeff Miller (New Monsoon), distinguished guitarist Sean Leahy, world-class violinist Matthias McIntire and renowned jazz trumpeter George Bell.\n\nIn 2015 music blogger Tyler Blue wrote, \"It's one thing just to be a badass guitarist, the whole other to understand what it takes to be a bandleader. Jones has what one might consider 360-degree vision in scanning the musical landscape around him and knowing where to go next.

Cash's commanding songcraft, expressive vocals and bracing guitar work make her debut solo album Gift Horse a rousing collection that showcases her pointed songwriting and the edgy musical sensibility that's been honed by extensive roadwork and onstage experience.\n\"I'd describe it as roots-rock storytelling,\" Cash says of the Independent Music Award-winning Gift Horse. \"The songs deal with love, heartbreak and various inner reflections.\"\nBeyond her solo work, Cash has also found time to maintain her membership in two notable Bay Area bands: the socially-conscious female funk-rock foursome Skip the Needle, with which she recorded the acclaimed debut album We Ain't Never Going Back; and the punchy, punk- inflected mixed-gender quartet Year of the Fist, whose three releases\u2014 the latest being 2019's Revive Me\u2014have attracted notice on the local punk scene and beyond.\n\"Being in three bands can be exhausting,\" admits Cash, \"but it's been important to me to cultivate these multiple outlets because of how I feel within each of them, and because I have a genuinely good time in all three. I do love working in such vastly different settings, because I can express various aspects of myself and my musical passions.\"\nCash's eclectic personal history has put her in a unique position to explore a wide range of musical interests. Growing up in close proximity to the Bay Area's punk, indie and skater scenes, she developed a deeply rooted sense of musical iconoclasm, absorbing punk, blues and gospel, not to mention the big band records she'd hear on her grandmother's antique hi- fi. After teaching herself to play guitar at the age of 12, she joined a series of bands, many of them female, before launching her own outfit, alternately known as Coal Pitts Wash and Dolorata. She also spent two and a half years playing with Turbonegra, an all-female tribute to the Norwegian punk band Turbonegro. She then attended Mills College's\nprestigious music program, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music Composition.\nThe lessons that Cash has learned along the way are reflected on such memorable Gift Horse tracks as the expansive \"Year Gone By,\" the haunting \"Broken Nights\" and the dynamic title track. Another highlight is Cash's vivid reading of the Patti Smith classic \"Pissing in a River.\" The album, produced by Julie Wolf (Ani DiFranco, Carly Simon, Indigo Girls), features guest appearances by acclaimed singer-songwriter Kris Delmhorst, 4 Non Blondes member Dawn Richardson and noted drummer Allison Miller.\n\"I would say Gift Horse is a chapter in a longer story,\" Cash reflects. \"The album was a vision that I had to see through to the end. Making it felt like a real achievement. It was a labor of love and a huge amount of work. I'm really proud of this record, and all of the talent, time, effort and community that went into it.\"\nWith Gift Horse now a reality after its lengthy gestation, Katie Cash encapsulates her goals thusly: \"I'm currently working with such an incredibly talented group of people. I'm focusing on bringing the music of Gift Horse to audiences through touring and performing at festivals. I will be releasing some singles in the coming year. I feel blessed, and with the same people by my side, I will continue to keep writing, creating and bringing more music into the world.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "630 Park Court, Rohnert Park, CA 94928", "Artist": "Amanda Miguel Y Diego Verdaguer", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619084.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.725157, 38.357333], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ballroom at Graton Resort", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Jacques Greene", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8567709.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Dance, Dance Electro, Canada, Alternative Dance, Electronic R&b, Dance Music from Montreal", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "www.jacquesgreene.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Seablite", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Imperial Teen at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "198 5th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Damir", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/167640.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.405257, 37.781458], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chieftain Irish Pub & Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Damir at The Chieftain: Occasional acoustic acts entertain at this Irish pub in SOMA - mainly Celtic folk acts singing maudlin ballads about the Emerald Isle - though the songs are mostly background music for draining a few pints.

The band responded with their next album not by resting on any laurels it may have earned, but by taking a new chance, pushing the limits of not just song writing, but song crafting. A desire to bridge the seemingly incompatible worlds of chaos and control led to 2003's WORMWOOD, an experiment in combining live tracks with studio manipulation. The risk paid off, earning four stars in Blender Magazine. Now, with the new release THE CONCH, moe. takes it yet further with the next logical step in exploring this unorthodox, albeit successful, approach.\n\n\"The idea was to take the elements of WORMWOOD that worked, both musically and technically, and exploit those ideas a little bit further and see if we couldn't do it under less chaotic, more controlled circumstances this time,\" says guitarist Al Schnier.\n\nThat quest for control within chaos permeates all aspects of creating THE CONCH \u2013 from the band's musical and interpersonal democratic process to the album's very name. \"The Conch comes from Lord of the Flies,\" says bassist Rob Derhak. \"The Conch is a symbol of keeping things civil. We sort of took all these elements of us playing as if one of us has a conch and then it's taken away and it turns to chaos. That is very similar to our lives. That song is a microcosm of the album and our lives.\"\n\nWithout moe.'s conscious effort to maintain control, the last fifteen months could easily have found a lesser band devolving into discord. The original recording sessions for THE CONCH took place during the spring of 2005; however, due to the band's rigorous touring schedule, the project continued at several different locations across the country.\n\n\"Some people do albums in a really short amount of time and it winds up sounding kind of homogeneous,\" says guitarist Chuck Garvey. \"This album was done over such a long period of time that there's evolution. The drums were all done at the same time, but a lot of the other work on the album was spread out so we kind of had different ears and a different attitude each time we worked on it.\"\n\nIt is this spirit that manifests on THE CONCH and gives the album a versatile cohesiveness.\n\n\"There's such a variety of music on it that I don't think one song will define the album,\" says Schnier. \"You take a song like 'Blue Jeans Pizza' and as great as it is and as great as the recording is, it doesn't define the rest of the album. It's the only song where these guys sing in falsetto for the entire song. One might be misled to think that all of the songs have Bee Gees-like vocals on them. Then you take a song like 'Tailspin' or 'Lost Along the Way' and it doesn't define something like 'Wind It Up'.\"\n\nThe ebb and flow of THE CONCH also includes highlights such as the gentle \"Where Does the Time Go?\", \"The Pit\" and \"Brittle End.\"\n\nEach song will, of course, continue to evolve onstage, to be joyfully dissected by fans in person or through live recordings. Those include releases on moe.'s popular \"Warts and All\" series, which, like studio albums, are available on the band's own Fatboy label.\n\n\"That's the greatest thing about owning the record label that you're on, that we're certainly the big fish in the pond now, and it's nice being in control,\" says Schnier, recalling the group's two major-label albums in the mid-'90s.\n\n\"This is the first time that we weren't constrained by time or money or any external circumstances. We finished each song to completion to our satisfaction and that's really the first time that we've done that,\" Schnier says.\n\n\"In hindsight, I feel like we were making a documentary of where we were in terms of our artistic output at that point. But it's not just a straight documentary. It's not just a news report, but it's like we really had the time to shoot the whole thing in black and white and really have it look beautiful,\" he says. \"It's like a really well-made documentary that you could watch again and again. The story is there, but it looks beautiful too. It's really well-shot and well edited and I kind of feel like that's what we've done with the songs here.\"\n\nThe first two weeks of recording took place at the State Theatre in Portland, ME, where the goal was to capture rhythm tracks in the natural reverb of the historic venue. Then a live audience was brought in for two sold-out shows, which included some mass crowd participation. If you listen closely, you can hear the results of these painstaking efforts on THE CONCH.\n\n\"We had a few things in mind where we actually wanted to engage the audience,\" Schnier says of the group's collective role in producing the album. \"There's one piece that really combines audience participation with the band's recordings and all the pieces just happened to fit together rather nicely. We were able to have the audience be a part of the album and that was something that was important to us.\"\n\nThat's a poignant observation, when you think about it. The audience has always been a major part of the live moe. experience. It was the fans' votes that determined the four Jammy Awards the band has won -- Best Live Album (L), Live Performance of the Year (Bonnaroo 2002), Best Studio Album (WORMWOOD) and Live Performance of the Year (Tsunami Relief Concert 2005). So it seems only fitting that it would be moe. who would pioneer ways to make the fans feel like an active part of the band, not just part of a scene.\n\n\"We have a very dedicated fanbase that's in it for the long haul, that's in it for the music. We've never had much of a traveling circus. Somehow our tours have a much different feel.\"\nThat's lucky for moe., because the band certainly has the kind of musical and conceptual imagination -\u2013 and deep catalog of songs \u2013- that lets fans bask in the glow of multiple shows, including a share of special events.\n\nThe quintet has drawn upwards of 6,000 fans to two-night stands at such storied venues as New York's Beacon Theatre, Chicago's Aragon Ballroom and Denver's Fillmore. The group has headlined Colorado's legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Atlanta's Fox Theatre and at the 2006 Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee, moe. performed on the main-stage before a crowd of nearly 80,000. This year will culminate in grand fashion with an evening of moe. at New York's prestigious Radio City Music Hall.\n\nYet moe. also transcends the four-walled experience of even the most historic of sites. The first week in January, the group and its fans will head to the Caribbean for a week of shows aboard the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship. And each Labor Day weekend for the past five years the group has also presented its own moe.down festival, inviting such kindred spirits as Flaming Lips, Medeski Martin & Wood, Matisyahu, Ani DiFranco, David Grisman, Violent Femmes and They Might be Giants to supplement heaping helpings of moe. In contrast to Bonnaroo, Schnier says, \"The idea is kind of like a moe. family picnic.\"\n\nThat family vibe begins with the five men that make up moe. \"We're brothers,\" Derhak says. \"We love each other dearly and hate each other fiercely, and we can't live without each other.\"\n\nThe music as it now exists couldn't live without any one of them either. While originally a dueling guitar-driven quartet, moe.'s sound has become significantly more textured over the years, with several shifts in influences and personnel. Original drummer Jim Loughlin returned in 1999 as a multi-instrumentalist and percussionist alongside fifth and current drummer Vinnie Amico, a subtly strong beat-keeper with minimalist flair. Loughlin provides breadth as well as drive, especially when playing electronic vibes to a Zappa-esque effect. \"A lot of the percussion stuff becomes this immense steamroller,\" Garvey says. \"They mix a lot of different styles in a very easy way.\"\n\nGarvey, meanwhile, provides a range of even-keeled riffing to blistering solos, matched by Schnier's range of twang to, well, blistering solos. In recent years, Schnier has added an array of keyboards to his set-up, as well.\n\nAnd finally, at center stage, bassist Rob Derhak weaves fluid, funky lines that provide the bottom-end glue, sealing the chemistry between the longtime bandmates.\n\nThe group's signature extends to vocals as well as instrumentation. Derhak, Schnier and Garvey trade lead vocals with contrasting styles -- and a balanced quality. \"Certainly singing in key is a good place to start,\" says Schnier, \"but it's also being creative with your harmonies and vocal parts.\"\n\nIt's no wonder that the quintet constructs broad, cohesive studio CDs that stack up song by song. \"The songwriting has been a focus for us for years and years now,\" he says. \"Early on, we fell into the trap of writing a song that was merely a platform for a jam, and there's no longevity in that.\" Derhak, Garvey and Schnier split the writing, but the group contributes to the finished product. \"Even if I write a song from beginning to end at home and bring it in,\" Schnier says, \"there's still a collaborative effort involved in getting that song up and running.\"\n\n\u201cA true definition of a band,\u201d Derhak says, \"is everyone contributing all they can \u2014 no matter what it is \u2014 to every song.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Hikes", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8076940.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463777, 37.783225], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "Genres: Nature-inspired Indie Math-rock With A Dash Of Folk; Thelonious Punk, Experimental, Alternative, Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Neck Of the Woods", "moreBioInfo": "Hikes is a band of friends from Austin, Tx.

On Can\u2019t Take My Money, BRKLYN reaches into their arsenal of songwriting, production, and vocal talent to create a record that asks the simple question: since we can\u2019t take our money to the afterlife, how should we spend it while we\u2019re here? With additional writing and production from RVRB and Niko The Kid, Can\u2019t Take My Money tastefully enmeshes elements of BRKLYN\u2019s emo past, with their progressive dance flare. Can\u2019t Take My Money arrives on the heels of BRKLYN\u2019s recent remixes for Armin Van Buuren\u2019s Phone Down, and Audien\u2019s Favorite sound, both of which remain in rotation on Sirius\u2019 BPM.\nLVL55 music Fabes\nContact us at 415.312.3668 or vip@templesf.com for VIP Table Reservations.This is a 21+ event."}, {"Address": "2565 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "BrandonTheFox", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8773473.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418454, 37.756094], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "Genres: Funk, Open Format, R&B, House, Hip Hop, EDM", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Arena Nightclub", "moreBioInfo": "An LA based DJ, Brandon Fox has performed on stage with celebrities and played alongside with some of the world\u2019s greatest entertainers.

Yet it is more than the sounds emanating from the speakers, it is also the man behind the decks: warm, compassionate, inviting. He is an entertainer and a catalyst: a magician who mixes deep melodies and sophisticated rhythms into musical journeys.\n\nBased in New York, Atish has cultivated a devoted following around the world. He\u2019s a natural performer who engages crowds with charm and a smile. An obsessive music collector, Atish pulls from a broad sonic palette, and with these sounds he creates intimate atmospheres and emotional experiences that linger in your mind long after the music has stopped.\n\nAtish\u2019s passion goes far beyond the decks as well. As cofounder of the Manjumasi record label, he has created an outlet for other artists\u2019 music as well as his own productions. His work has also found a home on prestigious imprints such as Anjunadeep, Kindisch, and Stil Vor Talent.\n\nAs a pertinent voice in the electronic scene, Atish has also hosted his own Late Night Tonite! Party series, which combines a sit-down talk show interview with an all-night dance party. This format provides a richer context for the music and strengthens the emotional bonds between the audience and the artist. For Atish, it allows him to experiment with what dance music is and what it can be.\n\nIntimacy and connection are the foundations of the Atish experience. His multiple residencies speak to Atish\u2019s ability to resonate with any crowd and highlight the range of his sound. From the blissed-out festival vibes of Desert Hearts, to the big city sophistication of New York\u2019s The Cityfox Experience, and the small club coziness of Miami\u2019s Do Not Sit On The Furniture, Atish brings people together with music and passion.\n\nThis passion can be heard on Atish\u2019s numerous DJ mixes found on Soundcloud. A prolific mixer, Atish finds the DJ mix the perfect format to create compelling narratives of rhythm and sound. Scrolling through his extensive catalog of mixes, one can hear an artist devoted to the music and dedicated to the perfection of his craft. It\u2019s the same devotion Atish receives back from crowds and fans the world over. They understand it\u2019s more than the music and the crowd and the DJ, it\u2019s the magic that awakens when it all comes together.\n\nAtish\u2019s ability to create a special atmosphere is perfectly summarized through his Atish All Night series. With full creative control over the venue, sound, decoration, and music, the party encompasses all that Atish has come to love about dance music through his illustrious career. After sellout shows in LA, New York and San Francisco, the open-to-close nights have established themselves as truly memorable parties. After all, it is the uncompromised Atish experience.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "401 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94613", "Artist": "Shangrila", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/312225.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.403705, 37.77731], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Endup", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "ShangriLa Asian queer dance party."}, {"Address": "1707 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94609", "Artist": "D-LO", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10097978.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27037, 37.80698], "Date": "Sat Feb 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-29", "Genre": "Genres: Rap, Hip Hop, Trap, Gangsta Rap", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "NZone Bar & Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "New Album dropping Nov. 30th Pre-order up now\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/asiyah/1442155557?uo=4&at=1001l3Iq&ct=888915775776&app=itunes\nFor bookings, hosting or verses call Brian Walker\n510 706-1997", "otherInfo": "D-Lo's Official Birthday Birthday Party,This is a 21 and over event with dress code enforced.
