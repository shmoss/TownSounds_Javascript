Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013. He's lent his vocal expertise to many local releases, and appears on MUSHROOMHEAD\u2019s album, \u201cBeautiful Stories For Ugly Children\u201d, singing on the track \u201cHoles In The Void\u201d\n\nAnd not to be outdone Joe has released three cd\u2019s of original material, \u201cJUST JOE SOLO EP\u201d (December 2011), \u201cMy Demons, My Burden, My Life\u201d (May of 2012) and \u201cGot Joe?\u201d (December of 2012). And now after a very successful Kickstarter campaign, Joe\u2019s next album, \u201cSo The Story Goes\u2026\u201d will be released this Spring 2013!!\n\nUpstate New York born and bred.

The result is the most wide-ranging musical effort of his career, a set of songs that examines issues of mortality, survival, connection, and celebration in ways that are both deeply personal and profoundly universal.\n\nIn 2007, the singer-songwriter began working with the Musicians on Call program, playing music bedside for hospital patients. He went on to play at VA hospitals, for the Wounded Warriors organization, and for the Melodic Caring Project, singing via video for children who are quarantined, too ill to have friends or family visit in their rooms.\n\n\u201cEverything about the connection of music hit me harder,\u201d he says of these efforts, \u201cand I thought, \u2018How can I be helpful, and reach out in a more real way?\u2019 Songs have become a bridge, a way for me to reach outside myself and into other people\u2019s lives. My mission now is to connect with people, to still have fun, but to have my intention be more outwardly based, and from a place of giving and service.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Lee suffered a difficult loss of his own. \u201cMy grandmother, who was the matriarch of our very large family, and the love centerpiece in all of our gathering, got really sick, and very suddenly passed away,\u201d he says. \u201cShe showed love in the small ways\u2014in how she smiled at you when you walked in her front door, how she made a piece of buttered toast a delicacy, how she spoke with such warmth and familiarity to her mailman. In all deeds, she was graceful and beautiful and kind. So her falling ill so quickly and violently hit us all hard.\n\n\u201cAt one point during her last night,\u201d he continues, \u201cit was just her and me in the room. The rest of the family left, because the doctor told my mother and me that they thought she was stable, but then something went wrong, and she started to fade very quickly. It was around 4:30 in the morning, she was fighting for breath, sweating, and fighting for her life. I stood with her, and held her hand, hoping that she could hear me. I felt totally helpless, and while I wiped away the sweat from her forehead, and words all felt worthless, I started to sing to her. I sang \u2018Somewhere Over the Rainbow\u2019 \u2018What a Wonderful World,\u2019 and my grandfather\u2019s favorite song, \u2018Born to Lose.\u2019 She looked up at me and smiled a faint smile before she drifted into her final sleep. A couple of the overnight nurses were standing in the doorway, and in a very tragic moment, we all shared a breath. It\u2019s in these moments that I realize how sacred music is, and how the world, which seems in such disarray, can find simple solace and connection in the light of song.\u201d\n\nThis incident informs much of MY NEW MOON; Lee points particularly to the tracks \u201cAll You Got is a Song\u201d and \u201cHang On, Hang On.\u201d But, he points out, the album is as much about other people\u2019s stories as it is his own. \u201cAll this work in the last decade comes to the fore,\u201d he says. \u201cI know many people who have experienced tragedy, and whether it be a friend, or a friend\u2019s child, or a fan I meet at a coffee shop who shares their story with me, I take them all to heart. I want to connect, and to be open to those who have hardship, so that that they know I hear their stories in the same way that they hear mine, and that we\u2019re in this together. I don\u2019t want to overwhelm the listener with sorrow, but I am inspired by these friends and families, and want to help their light find shape.\u201d\n\nMuch of Lee\u2019s recent work bore the stamp of strong producers\u2014Joey Burns of Calexico on 2011\u2019s Mission Bell (which debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, Amazon, and iTunes charts, and spun off a hit single with \"Windows are Rolled Down\") and Jay Joyce (Little Big Town, Eric Church, Cage the Elephant) on 2013\u2019s Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song. But for his last album, 2016\u2019s Spirit, Lee took over the helm.\n\n\u201cProducing my last album was cool, and I\u2019m very grateful for the opportunity,\u201d he says, \u201cbut after I did it, I realized that I had a lot to learn, and that I wanted to focus my energy on my performances, and on the songwriting. For this album, I wanted to open up, and push myself to collaborate with someone who was passionate and creative and could really partner with me to elevate the album from a sonic and musical standpoint.\u201d\n\nFor the new album, Lee turned to producer Tony Berg, who has worked with everyone from Public Image Ltd to Peter Gabriel, and moved operations to Berg\u2019s Zeitgeist Studio in Los Angeles. Such notable musicians as keyboardist Benmont Tench; drummers Matt Chamberlain and Chris Dave; and multi-instrumentalists Blake Mills, Ethan Gruska, and Jaron Olevsky all participated in the sessions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to grow as a musician, and to put myself around people who are better than me,\u201d says Lee. \u201cI really don\u2019t speak the technical or theory-based language of music, and there are times in the rendering of an arrangement that those skills are extremely vital. Tony was great at that. He has a very unique and progressive interest in harmony, and a childlike wonder and energy coupled with a lifetime of experience. He\u2019s a big-hearted man, and he really helped me explore realms that I didn\u2019t quite know how to reach. His ideology is, \u2018Let\u2019s go further left than we want and see what happens.\u2019 \u201c\n\nLee came in with fifty songs to consider, but knew that there were a few that were key to the project. \u201cA lot of this starts with the song \u2018Little Light,\u2019 which is the story of a family I grew close with whose daughter had very serious cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful kid who was suffering a lot, and sometimes she and her dad would FaceTime me from her hospital room, while she was going through chemo, and I would sing to her. I wanted to write her something with hope, and to remind her that she was awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Fade Away\u201d was written for a friend whose child passed (\u201cI was trying to embody something he may have felt, or maybe how I might have felt in that situation\u201d), while \u201cWhiskey on Ice\u201d was inspired by the unexpected death of another friend. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to his mother,\u201d says Lee, \u201ctrying to walk down the hallway with her in the middle of the night and feel what she feels.\u201d\n\nMuch of the material on MY NEW MOON was altered dramatically during the recording process. \u201cWe broke these songs apart and put them back together,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThe first track\u2014\u2018No More Darkness, No More Light\u2019\u2014was originally titled differently, and had none of these same lyrics. We put in one musical element, then rebuilt the whole idea around that, then scrapped that and worked on the layers that we had created. Then I rewrote the song with a lyric more appropriate for where the song was now musically. It was frustrating and teeth-gnashing, but I\u2019m up for the challenge. I learned a lot and grew a lot, but it took a lot of slow-motion movement to ease into it.\u201d (Lee notes that \u201cHang On, Hang On\u201d is the album\u2019s only song that is acoustic guitar-based; \u201cfor everything else, there was a better idea.\u201d)\n\nThis sense of digging deeper, of fearlessly bringing out the real essence of a song\u2019s meaning, lies at the very heart of MY NEW MOON. \u201cIn these days of political crisis, I do think there\u2019s also this feeling that there could be renewal,\u201d says Amos Lee. \u201cThat\u2019s what the title of the record is about\u2014a seemingly utter darkness that\u2019s also a beginning. I know that the times I\u2019ve grown the most have been in times of crisis, when I wasn\u2019t sure who I was.\n\n\u201cIn listening, and trying to connect to someone else\u2019s pain or someone else\u2019s victories, there\u2019s a lot of fertile ground to be found. Just a beginning, a simple place to start. A conversation, a song, to see and feel someone else\u2019s humanity in your own. That\u2019s always been my interest; sometimes I get there and often I don\u2019t, but I hope in these songs, someone finds a place to start.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Paul Potts LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616822.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Recording a live operatic song each day"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Darfiny Melo LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8961695.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Transmiss\u00e3o no meu instagram: @darfiny"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Barnyard Stompers LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9183255.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Americana, Southern Rock, Dirty Blues, Folk, Rock, Blues, Outlaw Country, Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hard working, traveling outlaw circus!

The music needed to exist, and it was as much an emotional exercise as a creative one.\n\u201cI think every other record that I've written, I wrote knowing that the songs would have an outlet,\u201d Costa says \u201cAnd for this one, I really didn\u2019t. It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating. But now everyone's going through something. And as difficult as that is, there's comfort in that too. Because we're all in it together, and we have been the whole time.

Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN.

The music needed to exist, and it was as much an emotional exercise as a creative one.\n\u201cI think every other record that I've written, I wrote knowing that the songs would have an outlet,\u201d Costa says \u201cAnd for this one, I really didn\u2019t. It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate.

And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place.

On their fourth studio album Everything Seems Like Yesterday, the San Diego-based band twist that dynamic to deliver their most emotionally direct body of work to date: a collection of songs written and performed solely by Carnevale, each track matching its stripped-back simplicity with both raw outpouring and intense reflection.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2019 album Live at the Observatory, Everything Seems Like Yesterday first took shape through a handful of songs Carnevale wrote on acoustic guitar back in fall 2018. \u201cHypochondriac was the first time I\u2019d ever written that way, and it felt really therapeutic,\u201d he says, referring to the band\u2019s 2018 Epitaph debut. \u201cIt pushed me to get much more into the craft of songwriting\u2014as opposed to mostly writing songs for people to mosh to\u2014and it felt right to keep going with that on this record.\u201d\n\nAlthough he originally intended to release that acoustic material as a solo album, Carnevale had a change of heart upon sharing his new songs at a series of shows in San Diego and L.A. \u201cAll the guys in the band came out and the response was pretty positive, so I started to think this might be something more than a bunch of songs to put online for free,\u201d he says. Envisioning the album as a natural evolution for The Frights, Carnevale soon enlisted Dotson as a producer, and the two bandmates set off to record at Carnevale\u2019s grandmother\u2019s cabin in Idyllwild, California.\n\nKicking off with the sweetly offbeat folk of \u201c24,\u201d Everything Seems Like Yesterday documents a particularly challenging year of Carnevale\u2019s life\u2014a period that began with the release of Hypochondriac on August 24, 2018 (i.e., Carnevale\u2019s 24th birthday). \u201cA lot of these songs are about friends who are gone now, either in the sense that they passed away or that we don\u2019t speak anymore,\u201d Carnevale points out. \u201cOur songs have always involved some kind of looking back over the past, but this one feels like the first time where I\u2019m dealing with those situations and growing from them. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s more mature\u2014because I don\u2019t know if I actually am more mature\u2014but it feels a little healthier than the songs where I\u2019m more caught up in nostalgia, and wishing things could just go back to the way they used to be.\u201d\n\nDuring their time at the Idyllwild cabin\u2014a free-flowing but rigorously productive week in late-April 2019\u2014Carnevale and Dotson purposely laid down the entire tracklist to Everything Seems Like Yesterday in exact sequence. In that process, they eschewed all digital production methods in favor of using a field recorder to capture a wide array of ambient sounds. \u201cThere were no plugins on the whole record; we wanted to force ourselves to be as creative as we could,\u201d Carnevale says. To that end, the two musicians ended up relying on everything from pinecones to pots and pans to construct the album\u2019s percussive components, in addition to introducing such sonic elements as the crunching of fallen leaves and the thump of tennis ball thrown against the cabin wall. And while recording the beautifully untethered \u201cSimple and Strange,\u201d Carnevale found his performance disrupted by an incoming call on the cabin landline\u2014then left that ringing in the track\u2019s final version. (\u201cEvery time I go up to Idyllwild my dad will always call to fuck with me\u2014like, \u2018I\u2019m watching you\u2026\u2019, so we just figured it was him,\u201d Carnevale recalls. \u201cBut when we picked up the phone during that take no one was there, and we never actually figured out who was calling.\u201d)\n\nWith recording in sequence giving Carnevale the motivation to \u201cmake each song better than the last,\u201d Everything Seems Like Yesterday ends on the heavy-hearted but hopeful \u201c25\u201d: a harmonica-laced number whose distinctly lo-fi aesthetic stems from some trickery on Dotson\u2019s part. \u201cWhen I was done writing that one I told Richard to come listen, and without telling me he turned on the field recorder\u2014and that\u2019s the take we ended up going with,\u201d says Carnevale. \u201cSo what you\u2019re hearing on the album is the first time I ever even played that song out loud.\u201d\n\nIn creating the more starkly composed songs heard throughout Everything Seems Like Yesterday, Carnevale made a point of placing a more careful focus on his lyrics, partly drawing from his burgeoning love of poets like Allen Ginsberg, Charles Bukowski, and Sylvia Plath. \u201cIf you can read a song as a poem and still get the same feeling from it, you know you\u2019ve done something right,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have plenty of songs from the old days that would really lack something if you took away the music and the melody, but these new songs feel more connected to when I first started writing\u2014back before the main concern was mostly just trying to get people to dance.\u201d\n\nAs they gear up for the release of Everything Seems Like Yesterday, The Frights are building up the album\u2019s tracks in order to accommodate the unhinged energy of their live performance. But for Carnevale, the album will always maintain an undeniable intimacy. \u201cWhen this was going to be a solo record, I had it in the back of my mind that it would really just be for my friends and my family,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd to be completely honest, that\u2019s still 100 percent what I want from this album. There\u2019s a lot of stuff on there that\u2019s about things that people close to me have gone through, and in a way the songs are just me trying to talk through them, and get a very personal message across without really worrying about anything else.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Ries Brothers LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Ries Brothers live Q&A session and Performance on Rootfire TV."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Frenchy and the Punk LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8510464.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Alternative Euro-american Folk Cabaret", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Frenchy and the Punk - Hooray Beret (2019)\nAcross its 10 fiery, witty, and exhortative tracks, Frenchy and the Punk\u2019s Hooray Beret challenges listeners to get off the hamster wheels of modern culture and social identity and cultivate a sturdier self and more authentic values. The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe. Their show is a carnival of two that will take you from the Moulin Rouge to CBGBs and back again.

My father who was a fine art painter and an architect would sit me on his lap and play name that tune with many classical pieces of music! Watching him paint and listening to classical music and opera as well as many other types of music was what my childhood was rich with.\n\nSoon enough I was also drawing, painting and playing music. I was especially into poetry, lyrics and songwriting having been exposed to this in early education by a teacher who was particularly fond of folk music. Simon and Garfunkel, Cohen, Dylan - we studied these amazing writers in our English classes. I adored writing poetry and this inevitably led to songwriting and learning my chosen instrument, the piano. I had a love affair with anything that included piano. I was influenced by the classical masters as well as early Elton John, Billy Joel, The Beatles - all kinds of music. Motown was also a big influence as well as classic and traditional Spanish music that my Mom would sing around the house. I had a rich tapestry of influences to drawn on and learn from.\n\nMy love affair with drawing and painting was also very strong, eventually leading me to study art at The Alberta College of Art in Calgary. I became a very successful award winning illustrator working on many important campaigns over the years and illustrating with Rick Jacobson, 17 children's books and many book covers, three of these books ( the most recent) authored by us as well as illustrated.\n\nIt wasn't until 6 years ago that the music career I had put aside rose to the surface with a vengeance and I began to once again write and perform all over Toronto. I recorded my first CD, The Other Side, in 2003 and this led to an invitation to the New York International Independent Music Festival where my band was awarded Best Soft Rock Band (there were over 600 bands in the event).

It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mega Ran LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8796843.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Soul, Video Music, Chiptunes", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Random's proven he can excel in storytelling, punchlines, poignancy, freestyling and, well, pretty much any other way you can measure an MC.\" - LA Weekly\n\nMega Ran, aka Raheem Jarbo of Philadelphia is arguably the world's most well known video-game influenced performance artist.

The legendary journalist called the record \u201cone of the least polished first albums I\u2019ve heard in the past year and one of the best\u201d in his review for Rolling Stone.\n\nRobert Palmer of the New York Times wrote that one of the reasons that the Iron City Houserockers \u201chave drawn so much critical praise is that they\u2019re bringing fresh energy to a hallowed and somewhat moribund rock tradition.\u201d\n\nThe band had created a unique sounding blend of blue collar rock informed by their influences which included a deep love of Chicago blues, early rock and roll and old school soul, all mixed together with dollops of the then-current sounds of punk and new wave added in.\n\nTheir second album, 1980\u2019s Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive), found them recording in New York City with an incredible supporting cast. Cleveland International\u2019s Steve Popovich and Marty Mooney tapped Mick Ronson (David Bowie) to co-produce the sessions, with additional input coming from Ian Hunter (Mott The Hoople) and Steven Van Zandt (Bruce Springsteen, Southside Johnny).\n\nHouserockers songwriter and vocalist Joe Grushecky recognized that they were entering into an unique situation. \u201cWe were a particularly effective concert band at that time. We just wanted to kick your ass and tear the place down. That\u2019s the attitude we had and then you had these guys that joined us who had much more experience recording,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey brought a little bit of sophistication to the whole process. You have the English guys and then you had the New Jersey guys and then you had us from Pittsburgh and on paper, it never should have worked. But somehow it did. Everything just fell into place.\u201d\n\nCleveland International Records is celebrating the 40th anniversary of Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive) with a new expanded reissue that is available on CD, vinyl(bonus tracks available via a download card) and on all digital streaming outlets. Grushecky worked with his son, Johnny (who also plays guitar in the current version of the band) and his sound engineer, Brian Coleman, to compile a second disc with an additional 16 tracks, all previously unreleased. More than an hour\u2019s worth of demos and rarities, including alternate takes and in some cases, songs that didn\u2019t make the final running order of the original album, add an intriguing chapter to the existing legend of the record.\n\n\u201cWe always went into a local studio in Pittsburgh and I would write songs. Some of the guys would bring in some ideas and we would demo everything,\u201d Grushecky recalls. \u201cMost of the demos, when we were recording them, we weren\u2019t setting out to make a final product. So a lot of this stuff is just first and second takes to see what the song sounded like.\u201d\n\nGoing through reel-to-reel tapes and even some cassettes that had been in boxes for decades, Grushecky found he had an abundance of material. \u201cAt first, I thought we were just going to include a couple of extra tracks on this reissue. Then I started finding all of these different things and I started to get excited about it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, to some people, I\u2019m sure it would be like a great lost Iron City Houserockers record.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Tune in to a special edition of LIVE & Joe's Place.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

The legendary Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, TX is hosting two nights of sold-out shows with headliner Michael Martin Murphey and his opening act Willie Nelson. Until now, the Armadillo has presented mostly rock acts.\nRolling Stone magazine has heard the shows might be special so it sends their top man in Texas, Chet Flippo, to cover the event. Flippo soon declares in Rolling Stone that Murphey is \u201cthe best new songwriter in America.\u201d\nMurphey has just released his acclaimed genre-bending Geronimo\u2019s Cadillac, and on this night he and Nelson present their unique fusions of pop, rock, folk, cowboy ballads, hard-core country, jazz and reddirt bluegrass. It is a night that defies all the music norms of the time; a night that some will call \u201cthe birth of modern Americana music.\u201d\n\u201cMurphey was a key player in the Austin phenomenon,\u201d Craig Havighurst of WMOT \u2014 The String recently observed. \u201cMurphey, along with Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker and others forged a country-rock hybrid that became the foundation for the progressive folk music field we now call \u2018Americana\u2019.\u201d\nNow 50 years after he began pioneering that music scene and laid the foundation for what we now call Americana music, Murphey presents Austinology: Alleys of Austin. It is both a celebration of that era and a look at the seminal period that turned Austin into one of the music capitals of the world.\nNative Texan Murphey already had songwriting success in Los Angeles when he returned to Texas and landed in Austin in the late 1960s. Still, Murphey says moving to Austin made him a better songwriter and a better performer due to the friendly association with other writers and performers who followed him to Austin and gave birth a burgeoning creative community that included Jerry Jeff Walker, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffett, Gary P. Nunn and other soon-to-be legends like Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt.\nFor Austinology: Alleys of Austin, Murphey chose music styles that defined the period as he explores why it perpetuated itself. He is joined by several artists who were part of that era as well as those influenced by the work the originators created:\n\u2022 Willie Nelson (on \u201cAlleys of Austin\u201d and \u201cCosmic Cowboy\u201d)\n\u2022 Steve Earle (on \u201cGeronimo\u2019s Cadillac\u201d),\n\u2022 Lyle Lovett (on \u201cAlleys of Austin,\u201d \u201cCosmic Cowboy\u201d and \u201cDrunken Lady of the Morning\u201d)\n\u2022 Kelly Willis and Bruce Robison (on \u201cLittle Bird\u201d)\n\u2022 Jerry Jeff Walker (on \u201cCosmic Cowboy,\u201d \u201cAlleys of Austin\u201d)\n\u2022 Amy Grant (on \u201cWildfire\u201d)\n\u2022 Randy Rogers (\u201cBackslider\u2019s Wine\u201d)\n\u2022 The Last Bandoleros (on Guy Clark\u2019s \u201cLA Freeway\u201d)\n\u201cThis album is not just about my songs,\u201d Murphey said. \u201cIt\u2019s about style and substance that makes a song that stands the test of time, a song that has a chance of living on in the Great American Songbook.\n\u201cSo I did my personal take on songs by Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Jerry Jeff Walker, Allan Damron as well as songs made popular by Willie and Waylon,\u201d he continued. \u201cI stayed with songs that came out when I was there \u2013 between 1968 and 1974 \u2014 because I personally experienced what the impact of that songwriting style was on the culture. [Laughs] Because I was there, you know? And I grew up with the mix that created the original American music: African- American Blues and Spirituals, Tejano/Irish/ German/ Cowboy Ballads and Dance tunes including Native American music.\u201d\nMurphey has traveled extensively and engaged in ranching throughout the West, but remained a Texas resident through it all, even as he topped the International and National Pop, Country, Bluegrass and Western music charts with such huge crossover hits as \u201cWildfire,\u201d \u201cCarolina In The Pines,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Forever For,\u201d \u201cLong Line of Love,\u201d \u201cGeronimo\u2019s Cadillac\u201d and \u201cCowboy Logic.\u201d\nThrough all the chart-jumping and genre busting, Murphey has remained constant to an honest, sincere approach to his songwriting. He is no more country than rock, no more bluegrass than classical, no more folk than jazz. He is, rather, a true AMERICAN songwriter. His stubborn determination to be the best songwriter possible has led to his songs being covered by such artists as Lyle Lovett, John Denver, Kenny Rogers, Hoyt Axton, Cher, Manfred Mann, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, and more.\nMurphey came of age in the local Southwestern folk music scene, starting with a Bohemian club called the Rubiyat in Dallas and other acoustic venues in Austin, Houston, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Denver.\nAfter briefly attending the University of North Texas (which had its own thriving music school), Murphey transferred to UCLA and worked his way through college as a singer / songwriter while excelling as a student of poetry, songwriter and performer.\nBut a growing family and the pull of his Texas Cowboy roots brought him back to Austin in 1968 \u2013 where he began a new musical movement with the help of Rod Kennedy (founder of Kerrville Folk Festival), Segle Fry (club manager and folksinger) and UT ethnomusicologist Roger Abrams. In May of 2018, the Country Music Hall of Fame honored Murphey\u2019s contribution as a founding member of the Austin music scene as part of their three year Outlaws and Armadillos exhibit. He\u2019s come full circle to his Cowboy roots, having recently been given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum and Cowboy Hall of Fame.\nPerhaps most striking about Austinology: Alleys of Austin is how good songs weather the years, which is precisely why such celebrated songwriters as Earle, Grant, Walker, Nelson, Lovett and as artists like Garth Brooks, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Ray Wylie Hubbard and more cite Murphey as a major influence on their own craft.\nWith the release of Michael Martin Murphey\u2019s Austinology: Alleys of Austin, his legacy is impacting new generations.", "otherInfo": "Live performances by Michael and friends from their homes and usually solo performances.

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to. All that matters is that I keep doing what I love to do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Way Back Wednesday"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Max Stalling LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10361294.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Americana, Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Texas based songwriter, Max Stalling, had no expectation of ever being in the music business. \u201cI didn\u2019t even pick up a guitar until graduate school,\u201d notes Stalling. After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred.

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to.

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jesse Labelle LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10376620.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born and raised in Toronto, Canada, Jesse honed his musical and songwriting talents throughout his years at Forest Hill Collegiate Institute alongside classmate and high school alum Aubrey Graham (Drake).

The legendary Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, TX is hosting two nights of sold-out shows with headliner Michael Martin Murphey and his opening act Willie Nelson. Until now, the Armadillo has presented mostly rock acts.\nRolling Stone magazine has heard the shows might be special so it sends their top man in Texas, Chet Flippo, to cover the event. Flippo soon declares in Rolling Stone that Murphey is \u201cthe best new songwriter in America.\u201d\nMurphey has just released his acclaimed genre-bending Geronimo\u2019s Cadillac, and on this night he and Nelson present their unique fusions of pop, rock, folk, cowboy ballads, hard-core country, jazz and reddirt bluegrass. It is a night that defies all the music norms of the time; a night that some will call \u201cthe birth of modern Americana music.\u201d\n\u201cMurphey was a key player in the Austin phenomenon,\u201d Craig Havighurst of WMOT \u2014 The String recently observed. \u201cMurphey, along with Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker and others forged a country-rock hybrid that became the foundation for the progressive folk music field we now call \u2018Americana\u2019.\u201d\nNow 50 years after he began pioneering that music scene and laid the foundation for what we now call Americana music, Murphey presents Austinology: Alleys of Austin. It is both a celebration of that era and a look at the seminal period that turned Austin into one of the music capitals of the world.\nNative Texan Murphey already had songwriting success in Los Angeles when he returned to Texas and landed in Austin in the late 1960s. Still, Murphey says moving to Austin made him a better songwriter and a better performer due to the friendly association with other writers and performers who followed him to Austin and gave birth a burgeoning creative community that included Jerry Jeff Walker, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffett, Gary P. Nunn and other soon-to-be legends like Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt.\nFor Austinology: Alleys of Austin, Murphey chose music styles that defined the period as he explores why it perpetuated itself. He is joined by several artists who were part of that era as well as those influenced by the work the originators created:\n\u2022 Willie Nelson (on \u201cAlleys of Austin\u201d and \u201cCosmic Cowboy\u201d)\n\u2022 Steve Earle (on \u201cGeronimo\u2019s Cadillac\u201d),\n\u2022 Lyle Lovett (on \u201cAlleys of Austin,\u201d \u201cCosmic Cowboy\u201d and \u201cDrunken Lady of the Morning\u201d)\n\u2022 Kelly Willis and Bruce Robison (on \u201cLittle Bird\u201d)\n\u2022 Jerry Jeff Walker (on \u201cCosmic Cowboy,\u201d \u201cAlleys of Austin\u201d)\n\u2022 Amy Grant (on \u201cWildfire\u201d)\n\u2022 Randy Rogers (\u201cBackslider\u2019s Wine\u201d)\n\u2022 The Last Bandoleros (on Guy Clark\u2019s \u201cLA Freeway\u201d)\n\u201cThis album is not just about my songs,\u201d Murphey said. \u201cIt\u2019s about style and substance that makes a song that stands the test of time, a song that has a chance of living on in the Great American Songbook.\n\u201cSo I did my personal take on songs by Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Jerry Jeff Walker, Allan Damron as well as songs made popular by Willie and Waylon,\u201d he continued. \u201cI stayed with songs that came out when I was there \u2013 between 1968 and 1974 \u2014 because I personally experienced what the impact of that songwriting style was on the culture. [Laughs] Because I was there, you know? And I grew up with the mix that created the original American music: African- American Blues and Spirituals, Tejano/Irish/ German/ Cowboy Ballads and Dance tunes including Native American music.\u201d\nMurphey has traveled extensively and engaged in ranching throughout the West, but remained a Texas resident through it all, even as he topped the International and National Pop, Country, Bluegrass and Western music charts with such huge crossover hits as \u201cWildfire,\u201d \u201cCarolina In The Pines,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Forever For,\u201d \u201cLong Line of Love,\u201d \u201cGeronimo\u2019s Cadillac\u201d and \u201cCowboy Logic.\u201d\nThrough all the chart-jumping and genre busting, Murphey has remained constant to an honest, sincere approach to his songwriting. He is no more country than rock, no more bluegrass than classical, no more folk than jazz. He is, rather, a true AMERICAN songwriter. His stubborn determination to be the best songwriter possible has led to his songs being covered by such artists as Lyle Lovett, John Denver, Kenny Rogers, Hoyt Axton, Cher, Manfred Mann, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, and more.\nMurphey came of age in the local Southwestern folk music scene, starting with a Bohemian club called the Rubiyat in Dallas and other acoustic venues in Austin, Houston, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Denver.\nAfter briefly attending the University of North Texas (which had its own thriving music school), Murphey transferred to UCLA and worked his way through college as a singer / songwriter while excelling as a student of poetry, songwriter and performer.\nBut a growing family and the pull of his Texas Cowboy roots brought him back to Austin in 1968 \u2013 where he began a new musical movement with the help of Rod Kennedy (founder of Kerrville Folk Festival), Segle Fry (club manager and folksinger) and UT ethnomusicologist Roger Abrams. In May of 2018, the Country Music Hall of Fame honored Murphey\u2019s contribution as a founding member of the Austin music scene as part of their three year Outlaws and Armadillos exhibit. He\u2019s come full circle to his Cowboy roots, having recently been given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum and Cowboy Hall of Fame.\nPerhaps most striking about Austinology: Alleys of Austin is how good songs weather the years, which is precisely why such celebrated songwriters as Earle, Grant, Walker, Nelson, Lovett and as artists like Garth Brooks, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Ray Wylie Hubbard and more cite Murphey as a major influence on their own craft.\nWith the release of Michael Martin Murphey\u2019s Austinology: Alleys of Austin, his legacy is impacting new generations.", "otherInfo": "Live performances by Michael and friends from their homes and usually solo performances.

You will hear him talk about \u201cstaying constant,\u201d being \u201creal\u201d and \u201cnatural.\u201d They resonate in the songs he writes, those he chooses to record and in every aspect of his career.\nIt isn\u2019t that Tom Wurth does not embrace change and growth. He has experienced a lot of that musically as he met milestone after milestone in his career. At the same time though, he believes that music can be a \u201cconstant\u201d for most people and they crave consistency from an artist.\nWhether you sit down to talk about his career, where he has been, where he is going; or listen to the lyrics of each song, you will know his commitment to that real and natural music. It is music you can count on with every song and at every show.\nThe new album A Different Soul shows that commitment. There are deep roots that brace this album. Roots from his small town up-bringing to his musical roots that are evident with the collaborations found on this new project which includes Vince Gill, T. Graham Brown and John Ford Coley.\nOut of the gate, at only twenty years of age, Tom Wurth was nominated for a Grammy. That particular milestone built a foundation for his career. The Grammy experience fresh in his mind, Wurth pushed forward with his songwriting aspirations.\nWurth initially signed as a staff writer with Belden; later signing with one of the largest publishers in the world, BMG Music Publishing. At BMG he garnered two major record label cuts including; \u201cIf the Road Runs Out,\u201d appearing on This is Ty Herndon \u2013 Greatest Hits and a Ken Mellons cut, \u201cI Can\u2019t Kick My Country\u201d for a NASCAR compilation, Inside Traxx.\nTom Wurth found the best school was on the road playing and in the studio recording. He took to both and never looked back. He has shared a stage with some of the most respected and successful artists in music including\nVince Gill, John Ford Coley, T. Graham Brown, Eddie Money, Larry Gatlin and The Gatlin Brothers, Lonestar, Billy Dean, Ronnie Milsap, Rascal Flatts, Billy Currington, LoCash, Pam Tillis, Mel Tillis, Thompson Square, Marty Stuart, Tim Rushlow, Trick Pony, Clay Walker, Tony Coleman & many others.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Tom Wurth for several years. I\u2019ve always appreciated his friendship and what I\u2019ve always admired was his professionalism. As we say in Alabama \u2013 he\u2019s a hard charger. (He\u2019s a) great entertainer, and one of the true inspirations in this business!\u201d \u2013 Marty Raybon\nIn 2006 Wurth signed his first record deal, recorded and released his first album on Aspirion Records. The first release from Tom Wurth, \u201cBread On The Table,\u201d reached the top thirty on the charts as well as earned a spot on CMT.com for the single\u2019s video. Wurth\u2019s next two single releases (\u201cGood Ground,\u201d from the album Tom Wurth and \u201cIf The Road Runs Out,\u201d from If The Road Runs Out) also enjoyed top thirty chart status.\n\"Tom Wurth is a three-way hitter. He's a tremendously gifted vocalist and artist and a Grammy nominated artist. Tom has a genuine love for the song, strong and memorable melody-tunes that people can sing along with. Tom is truly a gifted singer with a style all his own. I think you'll love what you hear.\u201d - John Ford Coley\nThis quote may well explain the feelings both peers and fans have about Tom Wurth and his music. What you hear on Tom Wurth\u2019s records are exactly what you will hear on stage. No smoke, no mirrors just great music.\n\u201cSome time ago Vince Gill finished performing and sat next to me backstage ... I have the same remark about Tom as I said to Vince, \"You did more with just you and a guitar than the act that preceded you with a full band. This is a wonderful talent that should be a much bigger name because he understands what it means to get up on a stage and perform. A wonderful talent.\u201d \u2013 Sandy Smolen\nTom Wurth crossed paths with famed rocker Eddie Money leading to a friendship and several collaborations. Money asked him to produce a special project, The Other Side of Money. Wurth took on the project bringing in John Ford Coley to co-produce the project with him. The album included a remake of Money\u2019s song, \u201cGimme Some Water\u201d and featured Vince Gill. For Tom Wurth\u2019s new project, A Different Soul, Wurth and Money once again collaborated, along with Scott Soderberg, with their co-write of \u201cBack On The Highway Again.\u201d\n\u201cEvery once in a while, someone comes along that has the quality, that believability tone in their voice with a simple but honest emotion, like he\u2019s talking late at night to his sweetheart in a quiet driveway. It\u2019s a gift. Tom Wurth has that gift. \u2013 Eddie Money\nIn 2012, Wurth signed with TaDa Records recording the studio album, Midnight Rain. The album brings together Tom Wurth\u2019s soulful blend of country with his trademark additions of R&B and gospel. Midnight Rain was featured on iTunes New and Noteworthy right off the presses. Singles from the album included, \u201cTo Love Somebody,\u201d and \u201cDiggin in The Dirt.\u201d\nFor Tom Wurth, music isn\u2019t just a vocation, it defines him as a person. If he isn\u2019t crafting a new song, out on the road singing or in the studio recording his own music he often takes to the studio as a producer. His latest project is with John Ford Coley. Coley\u2019s latest album, Eclectic, is a 26 song collection co-produced by Wurth and features Vince Gill, Collin Raye, Jamie O\u2019Neal, Georgia Middleman and T. Graham Brown.\nYet, there is nothing Tom Wurth would rather be doing than singing. This past year and a half he has devoted everything to the making of A Different Soul. There is no \u201cfast forward\u201d to this latest project on TaDa Records.\nIt is part of his artistic progression and builds on his musical roots. A Different Soul has quickly become labeled \u201ca different style, a different sound.\u201d It is not \u201cdifferent\u201d for Tom Wurth, but gives that same \u201cconstant\u201d fans have come to expect from his music. But, it is music different from anything you have heard before.\nThe project includes a song he will say \u201cdefines him.\u201d \u201cWhere I Belong\u201d was written by Wurth with Vince Gill and features Gill on vocals and guitar. For Wurth it is another milestone in his career. Right next to that is another Wurth co-write, \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Build It,\u201d that has his soulful vocals paired with those of another soulful singer, T. Graham Brown. John Ford Coley also appears offering his talents with background vocals on two songs on the project, \u201cOnce A Lover (Always A Friend)\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Make Love.\u201d\nA Different Soul is produced by T. W. Cargile (who also co-produced Wurth\u2019s Midnight Rain) and Tony Coleman (former B.B. King drummer for thirty years).\n\u201cIn my lifetime as a musician, I have had the opportunity and honor to work with the world\u2019s greatest soulful singers \u2013 Otis Clay, Bobby Blue Bland, Johnnie Taylor, Etta James, B.B. King and others. Tom Wurth is one of those soulful singers that I can add to that list. The first time I heard him sing I knew immediately I had to work with him. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of co-producing him on his latest recording, A Different Soul. I consider his voice and singing to be as soulful as those great artists I\u2019ve worked with and grew up listing to whether jazz, blues, country or R&B. I know people from all over are going to like, A Different Soul just like I do.\u201d - Tony Coleman", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Will Dailey LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7763884.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Roots & Blues, Rock And Roll, Americana, Folk Rock, Rock, Indie, Artist, Singer Songwriter...

I knew we had to be killing it, standing in that church rec center in front of all my high school peers at the time. The cymbals sizzling, bass drum pounding, bass guitar rattling your guts. Pure teenage angst, bouncing off the walls, an echoing dance of frequencies. I tried to remember to breath as my fingers in high strung discord slid wildly along the fretboard. It was my first live solo, and it was if just for moment the world had seemed to stop. I wanted the moment to last forever, though merely a brief passing of time. In hindsight, we probably weren\u2019t all I thought we were cracked up to be, but my first guitar solo as a teenager in that church rec center was enough to keep me hooked for life.\n\nFrom early piano lessons, too passing through a variety of school band instruments, music seemed to find a way in one way or another into my life. I can remember the sounds of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens coming through the stereo as kid. As my teenage years hit, music was a way to escape. A way to seem cool and distance myself from all the bullies in school. There was something so freeing about strumming a few power chords until my ear rang at jam sessions after school\n\nEventually my escape became a fascination more intense and artists from the likes of Roy Buchanan, to Pink Floyd, Branford Marsalis, Miles Davis, Trane and Mahivishnu began to infiltrate the tape deck. After leaving home in Charlotte, NC, and heading off to Appalachian State, a new world of tunes found their way into my heart, from the Flecktones, to Acoustic Syndicate, and Leo Kottke. Diving deep into jazz and theory classes, while playing in jam bands, my tastes evolved, and while I knew I loved jazz, I truly found joy in blending a variety of music, and melding styles from the likes of jazz, funk, blues, americana, rock, soul, and bluegrass.\n\nIn the twenty plus year that I\u2019ve performed professionally, I\u2019ve had the good fortune and honor of being able to share the stage with a variety of top notch performers. My family has made their home outside of Denver, CO, and you can usually find me performing in venues from coffee shops to concert halls. While I frequent a variety of different types of venues, my intention remains true to be a genuine as possible in what I do and never forget that you never can tell who is listening. These days you\u2019ll find me performing an eclectic mix of covers and originals as a solo artist, or on a stage with one of the bands or artists that I\u2019m happy to share the stage with.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Edward David Anderson LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8804342.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Americana, Alt-country, American Roots Music, Folk-blues, Roots Music, Songwriter, Roots Rock, Singer-songwriter", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Edward David Anderson is an American songwriter and rock & roll veteran who spent his formative years fronting the revered Midwest band, Backyard Tire Fire.

They tour the Northwest regularly as a duo, and put on theatrical shows with their full ensemble. They are alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriters Project and have played before Randy Newman.\n\nPortland's The Bylines exists in a unique musical plane, one at once grounded in the big-band past of glamorous pop performances and rooted in a present realm of intricate and highly addictive songwriting. With a focus on grand live spectacle--a facet of music often lost in the digital age--the group is equally at home in velvet-curtained jazz halls, large rooms and intimate venues.\n\nThat sound is the product of a marriage both sonic and literal. The Bylines is made up of two songwriters whose styles and influences converge to bring The Bylines' catchy, addictive sounds to vibrant life. Frontwoman Marianna Thielen, the glamorous face of the group, brings to the fore a background in composition, classical vocal work and, most obviously, musical theater, illuminating the stage with endlessly watchable bravado backed up by her powerful -- yet playful -- vocal prowess. Meanwhile, gliding his fingers across the keys is Reece Marshburn, letting loose a symphony of intricate melodies rooted in a combination of classical, jazz and pop music.\n\nThe resulting combination is a unique pop confection drawing on decades of influences, as if Cole Porter, Carole King, Dusty Springfield, Freddie Mercury, Paul Simon, Rufus Wainwright and Regina Spektor combined forces and filtered their unique compositions through classical maestros and film composers, then sprinkled it with a keen pop sensibility and a commitment to putting on the most involving, charismatic and personalized live shows this side of the Copacabana.\n\nThe Bylines have used their unique-yet-familiar sound to play to audiences large and small throughout the country, and have released both a studio(self titled, recorded by Bob Stark at Kung Fu Bakery) and a live album(The Bylines Live, recorded at the Alberta Rose Theatre in Portland, OR). The Bylines are proud alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriting Project, and have had support from the Regional Arts and Culture Council.\n\nWhether performing as a Thielen/Marshburn duo or with a larger band, the result is a blend of butter-smooth melodies, densely layered songwriting and powerful vocals. Most importantly, though, The Bylines musical cocktail goes down easy, and emphasizes something that is so often forgotten when such prolific songwriters present their craft: listening to music is, above all, supposed to be an experience\u2026 and a fun one.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ So Hype LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7069503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "DJ So Hype", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Derrick Reeves, known as Hype or DJ So Hype, is an American DJ and producer of segway music. \u201cHype\u201d, meaning extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion., suits his personality and skill-set perfectly when talking about his craft. This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cWEST COAST WEDNESDAYS\u201d EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.\n\nJim\u2019s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols (a young Lydon was connected to Jim\u2019s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.\n\nHeath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease, Whole New Life, which Heath calls \u201cthe most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.\u201d\n\nCall it a new twist on an old sound, Whole New Life was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band\u2019s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna \u2018RJ\u2019 Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend\u2019s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. \u201cI love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.\u201d\n\nRecording the album, Heath recalled that \u201cBack in the 1950\u2019s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I\u2019m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice. Whole New Life brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tour started around 1986,\u201d Heath chuckles dryly. REVEREND HORTON HEAT still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton\u2019s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton\u2019s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term \u2018Special Guests\u2019 on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, \u201cThe idea of playing in Jerry\u2019s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we\u2019ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we\u2019ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where REVEREND HORTON HEAT is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do \u2018Ace Of Spades.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.\u2019 He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said \u2018Never give them what they want, give them what they need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you, REVEREND HORTON HEAT is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.\n\nWhole New Life was delivered November 30, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tony Lucca LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10131981.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Singer-songwriter, Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tony Lucca is a Nashville-based singer/songwriter whose catalog of music runs the gamut from soul-infused pop to tear-jerker folk balladry.

He\u2019s completely crazy and completely sane, funny but tormented. He\u2019s a whole lot a rock n roll wrapped in a whole lot a country. Castle, a long-time resident of East Nashville, TN, has become best known for his songwriting about heartbreak, hard living, and lessons learned from a colorful life both at home and on the road.\n\nWorking in his newly-rigged home studio, Castle spent seven months crafting Brand New Hello, a self-produced album that merges his sharp singer/songwriter roots with upbeat tempos, layered arrangements, pop melodies, and rock & roll muscle. It's a bright album for cloudy times, filled with a sense of buoyancy \u2014 an anthemic synthesizer here, a four-on-the-floor drumbeat there \u2014 that emphasizes hope and renewal over sorrow.

The multi-million selling country icon is set to embark on a tour commemorating the 30th anniversary of his groundbreaking debut album Killin\u2019 Time, which all but altered the landscape of country music. Three decades later, Clint remains humble as ever about the massive influence he has had on the genre.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I was leading a change in country music,\u201d Clint remarks. \u201cIt just felt like big success to me. I would hear things like, \u2018So-and-so is going to record, and they\u2019re using their own band because you did.\u2019 Or, \u2018So-and-so wants to write more of their own songs, because you did.\u2019 But I don\u2019t feel like I changed anything, other than contributing my work to the big picture. It\u2019s hard to look at myself and see the impact I\u2019ve had. I do know that my songs have touched a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIf Black won\u2019t say it outright, his staggering career speaks for itself. His is one of the most storied careers in modern music. Black surged to superstardom as part of the fabled Class of '89, reaching #1 with five consecutive singles from his triple-platinum debut, Killin' Time. He followed that with the triple-platinum Put Yourself in My Shoes, and then a string of platinum and gold albums throughout the '90s. Perhaps most impressively, Clint wrote or co-wrote every one of his more than three dozen chart hits, including \"A Better Man,\" \"Where Are You Now,\" \"When My Ship Comes In,\" \"A Good Run of Bad Luck,\" \"Summer's Comin',\" \"Like the Rain\" and \"Nothin' But the Taillights,\" part of a catalog that produced 22 #1 singles and made him one of the most successful singer/songwriters of the modern era. Along the way, he\u2019s earned more than a dozen gold and platinum awards in the U.S. and Canada, landed nearly two dozen major awards and nominations, won a GRAMMY Award, countless Country Music Association, American Music Awards and Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nRaised in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, Clint Black is the youngest of four brothers. He began performing with brother, Kevin at the family\u2019s backyard barbecues. After high school, he spent 10 years on the local nightclub circuit and in 1989, he led a movement of young talent that transformed country music leading into the \u201890s.\n\nIn 2004, he scaled the top of the charts by trading lines with Buffett, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Toby Keith and Kenny Chesney on the Hank Williams classic \u201cHey Good Looking.\u2019\u201d He contributed \u201cThe Great Mississippi Flood\" to the 2005 post-Katrina charity album Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now. He released albums in 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nHis interest in releasing new music waned when his record label closed its doors in 2008. He explains, \u201cI had interest from major companies to sign deals, but declined\u201d.\nClint Black has hardly been idle since then. He\u2019s written and produced songs for Hasbro\u2019s children\u2019s shows and in 2010 and 2012 starred in the films Flicka 2 and Flicka: Country Pride, the latter with his wife and daughter.\n\nIn 2013, the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain began marketing an album of Black\u2019s hits, which continues to sell strongly and in early 2015, he collaborated with Joe Nichols on a Superstar Duets NBC-TV special for the Academy of Country Music.\nIn 2015 released On Purpose, his first studio album of new material in nearly a decade. He dedicated the album to his father, who passed away in 2012.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a huge country fan and is the first reason I listen to country music. He is probably the reason I\u2019m a songwriter today. He was my introduction to \"who\u2019s behind the music\". I grew up wanting to be the writer behind the song. That really all started with him.\u201d\n2018 was a particularly busy year for the Class of \u201889 alum. Always finding ways to challenge himself creatively, Clint produced his first ever holiday musical, titled Looking For Christmas, which focuses on family, love, and the magic of Christmas. It\u2019s expected to tour in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis has been in the works for a while now and it was great to see the audience reaction. Working with James Sasser has been both a blessing and a learning experience and I believe that the story is relatable to many Americans, both young and old.\u201d\nNow, with the 30th anniversary of Killin\u2019 Time approaching, Clint has earned the right to sit back, and let his body of work speak for itself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "RAC LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9010354.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Indie Dance, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Grammy award winning recording artist based in Portland, OR.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ So Hype LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7069503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "DJ So Hype", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Derrick Reeves, known as Hype or DJ So Hype, is an American DJ and producer of segway music. \u201cHype\u201d, meaning extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion., suits his personality and skill-set perfectly when talking about his craft. This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cWEST COAST WEDNESDAYS\u201d EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Resident DJ LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emma Brooke LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/259119.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ora Cogan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9582199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Dark Wave Shoegaze Experimental Folk", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ora Cogan inhabits a sonic space somewhere between shoegaze, folk, dark-wave & experimental.

She is a veritable triple-threat of musical talent as a guitarist, songwriter and vocalist. As with many blues women of the past, Foley has a long history of defying convention, and being a positive role model for aspiring, young female musicians.\n\nThe Canadian has been working professionally since the age of 16, and by the age of 21, Foley had relocated to Austin, TX and began recording for Antone\u2019s\u2014the esteemed blues label and historic nightclub that helped launch the career of Stevie Ray Vaughan and many others. In the two decades that have followed, Sue Foley has been busy touring and recording steadily, all while toting her signature pink paisley Fender Telecaster. In 2001, she won the prestigious Juno Award (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy) and also holds the record for the most Maple Blues Awards and has earned three Trophees de Blues de France. She has also garnered several nominations at the Blues Music Awards in Memphis, TN.\n\nWith 11 recordings under her own name, an instructional DVD and book, as well as various compilations and projects, Foley is set to release her new album, The Ice Queen (March 2, 2018) on Stony Plain Records. \u201cI\u2019m extremely excited to be working with Holger Petersen and Stony Plain Records. Holger is one of the most knowledgeable \u201creal music\u201d people in the business\u201d, says Foley. \u201cStony Plain is known to put out great music and I know The Ice Queen has found her home.\u201d\n\nRecorded throughout 2017, The Ice Queen represents Foley\u2019s full circle journey \u2013 her return to the roots of her career in Austin with producer Mike Flanigin. The album was recorded with her long-time friends and collaborators Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons (ZZ Top) as well Chris \u2018Whipper\u2019 Layton from Double Trouble, Charlie Sexton, and members of the Tedeschi Trucks and Gary Clark Jr bands.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teenager I idolized Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons,\u201d Foley says. \u201cThey're both legends now so this feels like an historical event (at least it does for me). And I grew up sitting at the feet of players like George \u2018Big Beat\u2019 Rains, Derek O'Brien and The Texas Horns. I spent many nights watching Charlie Sexton and the Arc Angels with Chris Layton. I learned and grew more musically in my years in Austin than at any point in my life. The fact that all these mega talented musicians have graced my album is beyond anything I hoped for. I am still pinching myself.\u201d\n\nA flood of inspiration and themes can be found on each of the tracks \u2013 ranging from lost love, anguish, and struggle to release, forgiveness and rebirth. Mostly recorded live-off-the-floor, Foley\u2019s emotional vocal delivery, conviction, accessible yet inspired lyrics and intrepid guitar playing are all laid out, bare and raw for the songs to reveal.\n\nOpening with the radio friendly and funky \u201cCome to Me\u201d, The Ice Queen also features upbeat and rollicking tracks \u201cRun\u201d, \u201cThe Lucky ones\u201d (a duet with Jimmie Vaughan) and \u201cGaslight\u201d. There are several bluesy and soulful tracks including \u201c81\u201d, \u201cThe Ice Queen\u201d, \u201cFool's Gold\u201d (featuring Billy F Gibbons on vocals and harmonica)\u201d, \u201cIf I Have Forsaken You\u201d, and a cheeky, guitar-heavy cover of Bessie Smith\u2019s \u201cSend Me To The \u2018Lectric Chair\u201d. Foley also provides some more mellow and unexpected songs on The Ice Queen with the jazzy \u201cDeath of a Dream\u201d, the flamenco-blues hybrid \u201cThe Dance\u201d and a beautiful cover of the Carter Family\u2019s \u201cCannonball Blues\u201d.\n\nThe Ice Queen represents Sue Foley\u2019s indefatigable commitment to her craft, and her transparency with the journey that birthed her, further proving that\nyou can\u2019t keep a good blueswoman down, particularly when she is The Ice Queen.\n\nsuefoley.com", "otherInfo": "Texas Blues Party, the NEW weekly livestream show featuring Sue Foley & Mike Flanigin.

At the same time, his recordings have consistently landed at the top of the New Adult Contemporary (NAC)/Smooth Jazz charts, a genre of music Tom helped pioneer in the mid-80s. As the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most renowned musical artist, Tom Grant\u2019s career achievements reflect his unique ability to embrace the full spectrum of contemporary music. Born to show business parents, Tom was at home with many musical instruments, but always returned to the piano. At a tender age, he was taught to play piano and drums by his tap dancer father. Later, he learned about music styles listening to music at his father\u2019s record store in Portland, Oregon. His brother, an avant-garde jazz pianist, introduced him to the many different facets of jazz music.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oregon and a short stint as a high school teacher, Tom answered his musical calling. Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper took Tom to New York in 1970 to record the chant classic Witchi-tai-to. After that, he toured and recorded with such jazz greats as Woody Shaw, Joe Henderson, Charles Lloyd and Tony Williams. Since 1983, Tom\u2019s records have repeatedly topped the Smooth Jazz charts. Several, including the popular Mango Tango, Night Charade, In My Wildest Dreams, and The View from Here, enjoyed lengthy stays at Number One. Tom\u2019s music has been a staple of terrestrial and internet radio both in the U.S. and around the world. His compositions are also used in TV and Films worldwide. He has been featured on CNN and the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tom is also a tireless worker for humanitarian and charitable causes. He has a scholarship established in his name by the United Negro College Fund. In 1999 Tom was also given the Humanitarian Award for Dedication to Music, Health and Children by the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell Medical Center.\n\nMore recently he has dedicated himself to numerous charity projects for the under-funded public schools in the Northwest, Potluck in the Park, a charity that feeds hungry people in the Portland area, and the Edwards Center for handicapped adults. In 2001, Tom started recording on his own record label, Nu-Wrinkle Records.

She sings with a sweet, haunting voice that can turn on a dime from innocent to lusty (\u201cNorah Jones with an added Cyndi Lauper element\u201d \u2014 Mojo Magazine; \u201cSpookiness suits her\u201d \u2014 New York Times). Whether playing as a duo with her husband Will Sexton or with retro-country sensation Motel Mirrors, she\u2019s an inventive, thoughtful singer-songwriter who has crowds throughout the US and Europe smitten.\n\nMusic fans first discovered this \u201csweet soprano\u201d on This World is Not My Home in 2005, but it was her Jim Dickinson-produced breakout albumAnchors & Anvils two years later that put Amy LaVere on the map.\n\nThe success of Anchors & Anvils drew the attention of the UK market, and soon Amy was invited to perform on the BBC\u2019s \u201cLater with Jools Holland\u201d \u2013 the appearance introduced her to an international audience, and to Craig Silvey (Arcade Fire, Jamie Cullum), who she\u2019d later team with to produce Stranger Me (Archer Records).\n\nSpin called the 2011 release \u201cthe break-up album of the year,\u201d Paste said it was \u201camong the year\u2019s best,\u201d and it earned a first listen feature from NPR\u2019s All Things Considered. She followed it in 2014 with another critical smash: Runaway\u2019s Diary, a concept album based on her own experience as a teenage runaway, produced by Luther Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars). American Songwritercalled it \u201cboundary pushing\u2026 heartfelt, reflective, challenging and consistently compelling.\u201d NPR Music\u2019s Robert Christgau said it was her best yet.\n\nHer most recent release, Hallelujah I\u2019m A Dreamer (Archer Records, 2015), was a surprise for fans just nine months after Runaway\u2019s Diary, recorded with LaVere\u2019s husband and noted guitarist Will Sexton. On Hallelujah, Amy and Will capture the immediacy of the live show they developed on the road together, reveling in a more stripped-down sound and celebrating the freedoms and limitations that come with it in stunning form. No Depression said simply: \u201cpure bliss.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her solo records and a tireless touring schedule, Amy enjoys collaborating with other artists. In 2012 she joined an all-star collaboration called The Wandering, composed of Amy, Luther Dickinson, Shannon McNally, Sharde Thomas and Valerie June. They released Go On Now, You Can\u2019t Stay Here (Songs Of The South, 2012) to critical acclaim and sold out shows.\n\nIn the afterglow of The Wandering, Amy and Shannon McNally hit the road together and released an EP titled Chasing the Ghost, The Rehearsal Sessions (Archer Records, 2012) which featured songs from both artists recorded live during rehearsals for the tour.\n\nAmy next paired up with noted rocker John Paul Keith to create Motel Mirrors. Their styles clearly complemented one another, which made for magic on stage and in the recording studio. Their eponymous vinyl EP release was named one of the \u201c10 Essential Albums of 2013\u201d by No Depression.\n\nAlthough she\u2019s a singer and songwriter first, Amy is also an actress. In 2005 she was cast in the role of Wanda Jackson in the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line (Twentieth Century Fox). Since she has appeared in a variety of independent and studio productions: Black Snake Moan (Paramount, 2006), $5 Cover (MTV, 2009), Woman\u2019s Picture (2011) The Romance of Loneliness (2012) and most recently with Grace Zabriski in Only Child (2015).\n\nIn 2017 Amy is keeping a busy tour schedule and writing songs for a new album to be recorded later in the year.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jessa Campbell & the Saplings ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9059060.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Kindie, Folk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jessa Campbell is an Oregon-based performer who bridges the worlds of music and ecology by enchanting young audiences with the wonders of nature through her songs!

Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control. It\u2019s his music, done his way.\n\n( Jon Hartley Fox )", "otherInfo": "THURSDAY NIGHTS LIVE #10.\n\nSwan Sovereign (Christine McKinley and Lara Michell)\n-Co-Presented by KVMR radio (Nevada City, CA)\n-Spirit Sponsor, Alibi Brewing (Incline Village, NV)\n\nEvery Thursday night at 7:05pm PDT, Tony and Stephanie will give a house concert from their living room!

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

Barely two weeks have passed since he wrapped up a support tour for Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder, and more than five years have gone by since there was a month when he wasn\u2019t on stage. Not to mention the albums: Rhythm and Repose (2012), the Grammy-nominated Didn\u2019t He Ramble (2015), and a soon to be released Between Two Shores (2018); a bevy of EPs; and to top it off, a five week \u201cCamino by sea\u201d in a traditional Irish naomho\u0301g, a journey which was captured on film and released as the full-length The Camino Voyage (2018).\n\nHe has earned both his exhaustion and now his respite: a month in one place. Taking a residency at the Centre Culturel Irlandais, Hansard has come to France to put shape to a new album. The intention is to create \u201can acoustic record with sparse accompaniment\u201d in concert with long-time friends and collaborators Joe Doyle (bass), ROMY (piano, string arrangements, and vocals), and Javier Mas (Spanish guitar, lau\u0301d).\n\nParis, however, has other plans. One night at dinner, friend, author, and classical singer Judith Mok introduces Hansard to the Khoshravesh brothers, who studied classical and traditional music in their native Iran before relocating to Paris. The simple meal quickly turns into a session. Hansard recalls working through one song particularly. \u201cThe Khoshravesh brothers joined me and I was transported. The song took on a new depth: I heard it differently, and new possibilities emerged. The ease by which they followed their own melodic line while being sympathetic to mine was intoxicating.\u201d By the end of the night, the brothers agreed to join Hansard in Black Box studios, where he will be working with producer David Odlum, and what was to be a straightforward album begins to take an interesting turn.\n\nThe roster of musicians quickly increases. Along with Joe Doyle, Romy, and the Khoshravesh brothers, Hansard invites Dublin electronic musicians Dunk Murphy (Sunken Foal) and Deasy to participate in the sessions, eager to see what might spark from the diverse range of musical traditions. Each day is unwritten, defined by an openness, a willingness to follow the spirit of the moment wherever it may lead. \u201cWhen you surround yourself with great musicians and do your best to keep up, stay loose, give little direction, and allow everyone to bring what they bring, something transformative may happen,\u201d Hansard says.\n\nOver the next few months, more musicians cycle in: Graham Hopkins and Earl Harvin (drums, percussion), Michael Buckley (saxophone, horns and flute), Breannda\u0301n O\u0301 Beaglaoich (accordion), Rosie McKenzie (violin), Aida Shahghasemi (Iranian singer and daf player), Eamon O\u2019Leary (banjo, bouzouki, and mandolin), Anna Roberts-Gevalt, (fiddle), Bri\u0301an Mac Gloinn (Ye Vagabonds, fiddle), Marke\u0301ta Irglova\u0301 (vocals), and Rob Moose (strings arrangements). They work with no agenda, no preconceived notion of what the sessions will turn into. But by April, it\u2019s clear that an album has emerged from this group exercise. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Hansard, \u201cwhen you take a small musical fragment and you care for it, follow it and build it up slowly, it can become a thing of wonder.\u201d\n\nThe resulting album, This Wild Willing (April 12, ANTI- Records), is indeed a collection of wondrous things.\nThose who have followed Hansard\u2019s career since his Academy Award winning turn in the film Once will have witnessed one artistic arc: the journey of a Dublin busker who cut his teeth on the greats - Dylan, Van Morrison, Leonard Cohen \u2013 and followed the path of the troubadour, the singer-songwriter to great effect.\n\nBut there is another thread running through Glen Hansard\u2019s musicianship. In his decades as lead singer of Irish stalwarts The Frames, rock and folk ambitions coexist with moments of strangeness, intimacy, and stillness: love songs drowning in the last fevers of the Spanish Flu (\u201cSanta Maria\u201d), protagonists who ponder throwing it all away and disappearing in a fugue state (\u201cKeepsake\u201d). And above all, the band, veering from silence to cacophony, ready to underpin soaring emotional and dynamic shifts.\nThis Wild Willing marks an inflection point in his career, a turning where he marries the sonic inventiveness of the best of his work in The Frames to the discipline he\u2019s found as a lyricist in his solo career.\n\nIt is an album guided and formed by the twin totems of resolve and surrender \u2013 the resolve to see a thing through alongside a willingness to surrender, to trust in that which lies outside yourself \u2013 the other musicians in the room, your lover, your healer, your audience.\n\nLead track \u201cI\u2019ll Be You Be Me\u201d finds Hansard weighing the risks of such vulnerability, of the giving of oneself to another. His restrained vocal belies the fury of the underlying instrumental\u2019s building storm. \u201cI\u2019ll be you, be me and I\u2019ll be you/I\u2019ll take your truth, your lies, your secrets,\u201d he sings, negotiating the consuming potential of desire. There is danger here, but it is without rancor or ill-will \u2013 the danger of a hare with its belly exposed. There is also a duality in the invitation: the audience is drawn in just as surely as the song\u2019s object, to the immersive world conjured by the album.\n\nA sense of unease lingers in the mysterious \u201cClosing Door\u201d and \u201cRace to the Bottom.\u201d The latter serves as a sort of diary of Hansard\u2019s residency in Paris, finding him \u201ccoughing my lungs up on the Rue des Irlandais/becoming a risk to myself\u201d an \u201c\u2019X\u2019 on my back\u201d as he wanders the city. Hansard insists, \u201cIt\u2019s more about the decline of a person or persons rather than of human kind,\u201d and yet it is hard to escape the sense that a collective worry is being tapped into, with the desecration of Joan of Arc in one memorable line echoing the more recent destruction of the statue of Marianne \u2013 that other great symbol of France \u2013 in the unrest that beset the country in the winter of 2018. It is lyric as prognostication, somehow in tune with coming shockwaves.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all darkness, however. \u201cDon\u2019t Settle,\u201d one of the few tracks not recorded in France, retains the raw energy of the various tour sound checks which brought it to life. It offers not warning, but guidance, as it considers paths of original artistic voices -\nShane McGowan, Lisa O\u2019Neill, Woody Guthrie, and James Baldwin to name a few \u2013 and implores younger artists to stay the course. It finds its conclusion on the record\u2019s penultimate track, \u201cGood Life of Song,\u201d summing up the possibility inherent in the bardic path. For Hansard \u201cthere\u2019s joy and sorrow for me in this recording, where they meet is a hallowed spot.\u201d Alongside these is a trio of songs: \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d\n\nand, \u201cThreading Water,\u201d each of which is presented so openly that it is easy forget that they are exploring private, intimate territory rarely seen in Hansard\u2019s lyrics. Here is Hansard at home in Ireland, rambling through October, preparing for winter. Here is a declaration of love, a poem put to song. Here is simple gratitude for a good life.\n\nThe album ends with the deceptively simple, \u201cLeave a Light...\u201d Lingering in the melody is the memory of a journey undertaken with friends, those living and those who have sailed on. And in the lyric is a path out, from disorder and discord, into the place where surrender and resolve meet. \u201cSo, say goodbye to the long, cold winter,\u201d Hansard sings, \u201cAnd farewell to all we\u2019ve left behind. Leave a light on and come out of the shadows. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll come back to find.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Broadcasting from the National Library of Ireland - Watch on Other Voices YouTube, Facebook & Twitter, broadcast worldwide!\nFor the duration of the series artists will be asking the viewer to donate what they can to a charity of their choice.

A student of house music, Williams has accomplished a full sweep of merited recognition that has accelerated over the last five years.\nEmerging onto the house scene in 2010, T.Williams instantly marked himself as a breakthrough artist with a difference; his unique take on house music has been fruitful has in turn, rewarded him with a loyal allegiance of supporters. Whilst he may appear new to the house scene, Tesfa Williams is far from a newcomer to music with almost twenty years of experience behind him having cut his teeth in the grime scene as Dread.D.\n\nSigned at the tender age of 17 to Jon E Cash\u2019s Black Op\u2019s with \u2018Invasion\u2019, Williams went on to have mass success in the grime and bass world, selling thousands of singles worldwide. After a five year reign in the realm of grime, Williams found himself veering towards the world of house music.\n\nIn 2010 a number of zeitgeist releases from Williams proved too good to ignore, one such release was hit record \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 featuring vocalist Terri Walker. The track played extensively worldwide before settling in at no.2 as iTunes best dance track of the year. In 2011 T.Williams defined himself further by releasing solo works on his own Deep Teknologi imprint, Local Action and Pattern.\n\nWilliams\u2019 remixes for Maya Jane Coles, Charli XCX, Ben Westbeech and Skream were also received with high regard.

Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar. The best is yet to come.", "otherInfo": "\"Be More Kind\" in full!\n\nThis show is a slightly different one. Free to watch, everyone welcome, I'll be encouraging people to buy records and merch, to keep @Xtra_Mile and my merch folks in house and home. It'll help me out too.\n\nWe'll be back to venues next week, but times being what they are, I hope people can forgive me for doing one show that's (partly) for my own benefit. Anyways.

Shorr was born and raised in Portland, Maine on July 11, 1994, where she was the youngest of seven children born to a single mother. Shorr soaked up a rich variety of influences from her siblings, and at the age of six, she began writing songs. At 13, Shorr learned to play guitar and gained experience playing in a rock band in Portland, singing Pink Floyd and Nirvana covers in a friend\u2019s basement. While she loved rock and pop, Shorr was certain that her future lay in country music after hearing Johnny Cash's cover of \"Hurt, originally by Nine Inch Nails. Determined to make her mark, Shorr took extra classes so she could graduate from high school early, and then held down two jobs at once so she could raise the money to move to Nashville.\n\nBy the time she was 19, Shorr had settled in Music City, and she landed a job at a hot dog stand while she searched for an audience to hear her songs. Things began looking up for Shorr when she became part of a weekly songwriter\u2019s showcase called Song Suffragettes that highlights the work of talented female singer/songwriters in Nashville. Song Suffragettes helped raise Shorr\u2019s profile which resulted in her first publishing deal, solidifying her dream of becoming a professional musician in Nashville.\n\nWith two of her fellow Suffragettes, Hailey Steele and Lena Stone, Shorr wrote a song about resilience titled \u201cFight Like A Girl\u201d and released it as an independent digital single in January 2016. The tune quickly won positive press and airplay on digital radio and social media sources with SiriusXM\u2019s The Highway channel naming Shorr a \u201cHighway Find\u201d and CMT making her part of their \u201cArtist Discovery\u201d program. With that momentum, she released The Y2K Mixtape, an eight-song collection of some of Shorr\u2019s earliest music that led to her becoming 2016\u2019s second best-selling debut female in all of country music (behind only Grammy-winner Maren Morris).\n\nAirplay of a second single, \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You\u201d, led into 2017 where Shorr and her next EP, Slingshot, received a barrage of critical acclaim from Rolling Stone Country (\u201cArtist You Need To Know\u201d), Taste of Country (\u201c2017\u2019s Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d), Sounds Like Nashville, Morning Hangover, Country Music Chat, Whiskey Riff and CMT. Teen Vogue came calling and in May 2017, the publication named Shorr one of \u201c10 Female Artists Who Are Changing the Music Game\u201d. She was the only country artist featured in their annual music issue which specifically dubbed Shorr \u201cThe New Nashville\u201d. Later that year, Kalie was named to the CMT Next Women of Country Class of 2018, a prestigious list that recognizes the newest and brightest female artists in country music.\n\nCreatively, Shorr spent most of 2017 writing songs and working on a new sound that infuses her country core with many of the rock influences she grew up on. Producer and songwriter Skip Black (Jana Kramer, Theory of a Deadman) helped her finally find the common thread that connects the big guitars of rock music to the story-telling and passion for lyric that cements her in country. It was a deep dive into song craftsmanship and sonic production that yielded her first 2018 single, \u201cTwo Hands\u201d, featured on Shorr\u2019s newest EP Awake.\n\nAmidst critical acclaim for her punk-country sound on Awake, Kalie was named one of the \u201cTop 10 Country Artists To Watch In 2018\u201d by the Huffington Post just as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d was added to prominent playlists at SiriusXM The Highway, Radio Disney Country, TuneIn's Country Roads, Pandora, Amazon Music and Apple Music. The \u201cTwo Hands\u201d music video was also added to CMT, GAC and to Vevo's DSCVR Country playlist.\n\nIn January 2018 after being inspired by speeches at the Golden Globe Awards, Kalie co-wrote a song called \u201cTimes-Up\u201d that went on to be recorded by 23 women of Song Suffragettes with an accompanying music video that received major press coverage from the Associated Press, Boston Globe, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, Voice of America and many more including a feature on Grammy.com.\n\nShorr recently wrapped the CMT Next Women of Country Tour with country superstars Sara Evans and RaeLynn and will continue extensive touring throughout the summer.\n\nIn May, Shorr was the only independent artist named to Taste of Country\u2019s \u201c2018 Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d list just as her brand new single \u201cCandy\u201d hit radio airwaves and streaming playlists.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adexe y Nau ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9215773.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Urban, Latin, Reggaeton", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Nauzet (9/12/2002) y Adexe (7/07/2005) Guti\u00e9rrez Hern\u00e1ndez son dos hermanos canarios, nacidos en Santa Cruz de Tenerife, que forman Adexe y Nau, que es el mayor fen\u00f3meno musical espa\u00f1ol de la era digital.

Hailing from Vancouver, Maze is not only a multi-instrumentalist and powerhouse vocalist, but also a one woman band and live looping extraordinaire, seamlessly looping drum beats, keyboards, guitars and more, to create fully-realized, hooky pop anthems live off the floor. Her freshly dropped album, \"Asymmetry\", has received rave reviews from critics, including The Georgia Straight, who decidedly named it their Album of the Week. Mike Usinger of The Georgia Straight called Asymmetry \"a collection of fully realized and impeccably produced modern electronic-pop tracks that are slick enough to hold their own on playlists that include selections from heavy-hitters like Charli XCX and Rita Ora\".\n\nA commanding and charismatic solo performer, Maze received high praise from fans and critics alike at her Album Release Show this past November. Celebrating the release of Asymmetry, Maze played to a sold-out house at Vancouver's Blue Light Studios, and wowed her audience with 90 minutes of explosive electro-pop bangers. Other 2018 show highlights include: opening up at the Vancouver Playhouse for the 2018 Public Salon, performing at SFU Woodward's for Juno Week, showcasing twice at Canadian Music Week, and carrying out a summer festival tour with stops at Golden Spike Days, Sydney Summer Concerts, Kamloops in the Park, and Desert Daze to name a few.\n\nIn the past, Cassandra Maze has performed for the TD Vancouver Jazz Festival, CBC Musical Nooners, Kaleidoscope Festival and at the legendary Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. Her debut album, Velocity, was released in 2017 and has garnered over 100k Spotify streams to date. The album's lead single, \"Wait\", received multiple national Canadian Radio features and regular rotation on College Radio.\n\nAdditionally, Maze was a CBC Searchlight Regional finalist, played keyboards and sang backup for Victoria Duffield and Devin Townsend, and has had her music played on the Showtime mini series, Eve of Destruction.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Arielle Silver ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10247758.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Americana, Indie Folk, Alt-country", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Arielle Silver crafts songs that are luminous, literate, and alive. A Thousand Tiny Torches, the singer-songwriter\u2019s new Indie Folk Americana collection, is a testament to her renewal of inspiration, the rekindling of dreams, and the redemptive power and connective compassion that defines her artistry.\n\nHer rich, expressive alto voice frames expansive melodies that echo the American heartland. Now based in Los Angeles, Arielle knows this geography well. A performing itinerary transported her from Club Passim in her adopted hometown of Boston to venues including Eddie\u2019s Attic in Atlanta and Nashville\u2019s 12th & Porter, plus stops to the Southwest, as she steered a vegetable oil-fueled vehicle across Texas to Abilene, Odessa and Austin.\n\nTen years ago, with three well-received releases accompanied by national tours, she lost sight of her future as an artist. \u201cThough my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore,\u201d she recalls.\n\nArielle moved to the City of the Angels. She divorced and remarried, taught yoga philosophy, and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. She penned and published essays and poems, and was nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best New Poets. She baked innumerable pies. After being rejected for a PhD program, she constructed a blue \u201cshe shed\u201d in her backyard. And it was in this rustic space \u2013 surrounded by 47 volumes of her journals \u2013 that she rekindled her love for music and dedicated herself to writing one song per week.\n\nThe result is A Thousand Tiny Torches. Produced by Shane Alexander, the project is propelled by the masterful playing of a sterling cast of players with credits from Lady Gaga to KT Tunstall to Lukas Nelson: Denny Weston Jr., drums; Carl Byron, keyboards; Darby Orr, bass; Jesse Siebenberg, steel guitar; and Mike Mullins on mandolin. Michael Gehring tracked the project at Secret World Studios in Los Angeles in the famous Sound City Studios complex, and GRAMMY-winners Brian Yaskulka and Hans DeKline mixed and mastered, respectively. A loyal group of supporters funded the recording through a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nA consummate storyteller, Arielle\u2019s narratives crosscut exacting details with universal themes. On the lead single \u201cWhat Really Matters,\u201d she recalls a harrowing season in Southern California as gunshots ricocheted through a country bar and the surrounding hills ignited with apocalyptic wildfires.\n\nIn contrast are incandescent songs with characters and conversations etched in fine lines and deep empathy. Vivid imagery glows with headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars that have been shining for ten billion years.\n\nAfter launching her return with a holiday single, Arielle is now back onstage at house concerts and listening rooms, including the fabled Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood. Plans are underway for West Coast tours and upcoming dates in Boston. This time, she says, she is doing it for the right reasons. \u201cWhen I was younger I was performing,\u201d she confirms. \u201cNow, I\u2019m connecting.\"\n\nArielle Silver says that when she made her break with music, her ambition for everything stopped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the future. It was beautiful. I became so present in a way I never had been before, and the sense of being present lasted for a long time.\u201d Now, in themes that speak to losing and rediscovering the path, emerges a musical alchemy of renewal and rebirth: A loving light that is reflected from A Thousand Tiny Torches.", "otherInfo": "Join the livestream here: http://instagram.com/ariellesilver\n\nTomes & Tunes is a weekly Instagram series, hosted by Arielle Silver, where songwriters talk books and swap songs.\n\nEpisode 4 features guest songwriter, Crissie McCree.\n\nFollow \"Arielle Silver\" on Instagram (@ariellesilver) to watch episode #4.\n\nCatch previous episodes on @ariellesilver IGTV."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luisana Lopilato ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ohmme ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10224976.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Macie Stewart, Sima Cunningham", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There's an obvious chemistry emanating throughout Ohmme's music that's so tangible it can only come from a decades-spanning friendship. Songwriters Sima Cunnningham and Macie Stewart formed their unbreakable bond performing throughout the fringes of Chicago's many interlocking communities, collaborating with titans from the city's indie rock, hip-hop, and improvised worlds. But together, along with drummer Matt Carroll, they've stretched the boundaries of what guitar music can do starting with the band's experimental 2016 self-titled EP and their adventurous debut 2018 LP Parts. Now their longstanding partnership culminates with the stunning and muscular follow-up Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nOhmme formed in 2014 as an outlet for Cunningham and Stewart to explore an unconventional approach to their instruments. \"That's the whole genesis of the band: us walking up to our guitars and saying, 'how can we make this noisemaker do something different?'\" says Cunningham. But as their musical collaboration strengthened, bringing Parts and intensive tours with acts like Wilco, Iron & Wine, Twin Peaks, and more, the band's scope and focus has also broadened. Fantasize Your Ghost is the direct result of the band spending more time on the road than in Chicago, a record deeply concerned with questions of the self, the future, and what home means when you're travelling all the time.\n\n\"Grinding on tour last year for so long, it can alter your mental state where you have to think about your life in a different way than you would if you're home. A lot of the songs stemmed from just thinking about all of the possibilities that life could be and could take,\" says Stewart. On the commanding single \"3 2 4 3,\" which tackles the terrifying realization of needing to make a change. The song opens with the two singing in transfixing harmony, \"Looked in the mirror the other day / Caught my reflection / My mouth had moved a different way / The muscles were straining.\" Their deft scene-setting and the way their disparate voices blend together heightens the song's inherent anxiety. Later, they sing, \"Filling the holes to make amends / Tearing them up to start again.\" These moments of emotional clarity fill Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nWritten across 2019, early sketches of the album's tracklist were demoed at Sam Evian's Flying Cloud Studios in upstate New York. \"That's where we really started to see the record come together,\" says Cunningham. The sessions were intensely collaborative and open: the product of long, existential conversations between Stewart and Cunningham in the van about their lives and how to channel the anger they were feeling about the state of the world. Tracks like the driving opener \"Flood Your Gut\" underwent several revisions with Ohmme uncovering several new directions the song could go before finishing it. The refrain \"your whole vision's not enough\" is a call to action, says Cunningham. \"Do you want to be someone who can disconnect or someone who is hyper-engaged and present?\"\n\nFantasize Your Ghost was recorded over a six day session in August 2019 when the band decamped to the Post Farm in southern Wisconsin, where Cunningham runs a yearly DIY music festival. With indie rock journeyman producer Chris Cohen and the idyllic setting just outside Chicago, the songs came to vibrant life. Though Parts showcased their wildly burgeoning influences and talents, Fantasize Your Ghost captures the astounding magnetism and ferocity of their live show. \"Selling Candy\" is the perfect example. It's a small snapshot of childhood complete with nostalgic references to summertime hot dogs and wandering the city but set to an explosive, stadium-ready fuzzed-out arrangement. Elsewhere, songs like the dystopian dance rocker \"The Limit\" further stretch their already dynamic palette.\n\nFantasize Your Ghost encapsulates the thrilling and sometimes terrifying joy of moving forward even if you don't know where you're going. It's an album that asks necessary questions: When life demands a crossroads, what version of yourself are you going to pursue? What part of yourself will you feed and let flourish and what do you have to let go of? When they sing, \"Just walk out the door and / Don\u2019t tell them goodbye\" it's drastic but also exhilaratingly hopeful. This is a record of strength, of best friends believing in each other. Unapologetic and brave, Ohmme are ready to figure it all out together.", "otherInfo": "Ohmme live on Dr Martens Instagram - Stay In Series #drmartenspresents\n\n5/21 at 2pm PST/4pm CT"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jocelyn & Chris Arndt ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10386317.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cPutting a millennial spin on classic rock.\u201d\n- Today Show NBC\n\n\"These outrageously talented siblings boast a time-honored sound that is well beyond their years.\"\n- Baeble Music\n\n\u201cThe Arndts sound like they were raised on 60\u02bcs rock records and would enjoy having a drink with the ghost of Janis Joplin.\u201d\n- The New York Scene Report\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nWith vocal comparisons to Janis Joplin and Grace Slick and guitar work likened to Jimi Hendrix and David Gilmour, Jocelyn & Chris Arndt took their new record to #1 on the Jambands Top 30, cracked the Billboard Triple A Top 40, and earned a national TV debut on NBC's Today Show.

The way their voices blend together in song conjures an imagined romance, much like their own. Before they met, Benjamin and Mia worked hard at their craft but each felt separately, something was missing. Their first songwriting session together, in 2004, led to the discovery that what they were missing was each other. Fast forward to today, they have now released five studio albums, one live album, were named semi-finalists at the 2018 International Songwriting Competition, and were nominated at the 2018 International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nTheir most recent project, \u201cLive at Home\u201d was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, at a house concert in Azalea\u2019s living room. The recording captures the acoustic heart and soul of six songs from their 2017 studio release, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, two new original songs, and a cover of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d, from the motion picture \u201cOnce\u201d. Tickets were sold as a crowdfunding perk to help raise funds to record the aforementioned studio release.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was released on October 13, 2017 and was supported by a multi-province 2 week tour. Written and recorded in their home studio, this project features love songs, beautiful vocal harmony and showcases Benjamin & Mia\u2019s musical abilities. The album sits comfortably in the \u201cContemporary Roots\u201d genre featuring songs that borrow from North American and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as conventional pop sensibilities.\n\n\u201cI See The Church\u201d from the album \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was nominated at the 2018 IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) in the \u201cBest Group/Duo\u201d category .\n\nHamilton Blues Lovers Blog has this to say about the album,\n\n\u201cHamilton musical duo, Azalea keeps growing with every recording and their latest, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d proves it. The production is amazing and they\u2019ve created a fabulous melding of pop and roots music. Their lush vocal harmonies flow through the entire album as the sometimes infectious and always beautiful melodies bolster the sound. It\u2019s a perfect mix of vocals and music that can\u2019t help but effect you emotionally\u2026\u201d\n\nIn May 2015 Azalea was hand picked by GigSalad & CD Baby to play their junket for Canadian Music Week in Toronto, Ontario. In honour of this occasion, Azalea recorded and released a limited edition EP called \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d. As a salute to GigSalad & CD Baby\u2019s DIY methodology, \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d was made completely in house with fabric bound hand packaging.\n\nIn 2013, Azalea released the EP \"Inside Out\". An album which streamlined their folk- tinged pop sound and showcased songs to tug at the heart strings with haunting melodic and harmonic lines. Reminiscent of The Civil Wars, and Fleetwood Mac \u201cInside Out\u201d shed light on Azalea\u2019s Alt-Country side. The pitch for its successful crowd- funding campaign gave some insight into their work:\n\n\". . . it has always been our goal to release quality music that is culturally relevant and speaks to the heart. . . . However, we wanted to take listeners on a journey beyond the routine of everyday life to the place that connects them with their emotions, beliefs, and values in a real way.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012 Azalea released \u201cAt the End of This Year...\u201d, their seasonal single which has received the nod of approval from CBC radio.\n\nAzalea\u2019s 2010 release, \u201cCoffee & Kisses EP\", was among the top three finalists for Recording of the Year, Rock Recording of the Year, Instrumentalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the 2010 Durham Region Music Awards. The album was featured in prominent music magazines and generated good response from college radio across Ontario.\n\nYears before anyone knew Benjamin & Mia Hackett as Azalea, they performed, travelled, and recorded an album as Benjamin & Mia. \u201cThe Carousel of Life\u201d (2007) is the root of their love for each other and for their musical life together. That first album thrust them into the life they know, love, and hope to express in song, to every listener.\n\nAzalea\u2019s chemistry is undeniable - their stage presence magnetic! To experience Azalea in concert is to be invited into their love story. They will will draw you in and pull on your hearts strings. Azalea will take you on an emotional rollercoaster as they move through their repertoire of simple & sweet love songs, then take you south with swampy tunes which are full of rich vocal harmony and live looping.

With the NGDB he has played over 8,500 shows - and performed 2500+ solo in addition to that - and flown 3 million miles to do it. McEuen has performed on over 300 television shows. At the end of the 50th NGDB tour John left the group to fill the demand for his own shows and solo work.\n\nHis recent Made in Brooklyn album on the prestigious Chesky Records - with many star performers sitting in - was Stereophile Magazine's Record of the Month.\n\nOne of his particular points of pride has been performing on the Grand Ole Opry - featured numerous times solo, and as a guest with several other Opry member acts; he brought Steve Martin there in 2010 for the Opry debut of The Crow. But his highest point on the Opry was playing it with sons Jonathan and Nathan, which they have done twice .\n\nIn 1971 John initiated what Rolling Stone called 'the' most important record to come out of Nashville, and what the 2004 ZAGAT survey called the most important record in country music, \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken.\" Asking both Earl Scruggs and then (10 days later) Doc Watson if they would record with the band was followed by his brother Bill lining up Merle Travis. This started the ball rolling and shortly Louise Scruggs then helped line up, at their request, Jimmy Martin, Maybelle Carter, and Roy Acuff..Earl Scruggs secured Vassar Clements and Junior Huskey, and the NGDB went to Nashville in August of '71 to make what would become an historic album, released on United Artists Records in spring of 1972.\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist (banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle) and solo entertainer, John McEuen plays to the boomer/'old hippie' crowd and the traditional/bluegrass and folk audience, as well as the older country audience... and now the younger group is showing up to see 'where it all came from'.\n\nJohn has made over 40 albums (six solo) that have earned four platinum and four gold recognition awards, Grammy nominations and awards, CMA and ACM awards, Western Heritage Award, Emmy nomination, and IBMA record of the year award.

After 12 years of playing as many as 300 shows each year, Rev.

This following is sure to eat up the bands latest offering, Poor Until Payday, (the second on their own Family Owned Records label through hip Nashville indie Thirty Tigers) out October 5th, a country blues record that was made the right way \u2014 two feet on the ground and both hands getting dirty.\n\nWith all the power of a freight train, the Big Damn Band is known for its live shows. Rev. Peyton delivers guitar pyrotechnics the old fashioned way \u2014 ten fingers, a 6 string and an amp cranked at full tilt. In the country blues style, he plays the bass with his thumb, while picking the lead with his fingers at the same time. When he lifts the guitar behind his head to play there's nothing but skill and 16 gauge nickel strings to make the soundscoming out of the speakers.\n\nBeside him on stage are just two other people. His wife, \u201cWashboard\u201d Breezy Peyton playing with all the nuance and percussive power of a New Orleans drum line, and keeping the train moving is Max Senteney on a lean drum kit including a 5 gallon maple syrup bucket. Together they play Peyton's wildman country blues that's as much ZZ Top as it is Bukka White.\n\nOn Poor Until Payday Peyton wanted a sound as live and electric as the records made in the heyday of 45 rpm blues classics from Chess, Stax and Sun Records. Playing his\nbeloved custom-made National steel resonator, a 1949 Harmony Archtop, a 1954 Supro Dual Tone and a 1955 Kay Speed Demon through a 1949 Supro amp, Rev wanted to restore the \u201cwarmth, pops and hisses\u201d mostly eliminated by modern-day compression. The band played in a room together with minimal micing (using only the best classic pieces they could get) with the main effect being tape saturation.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe result is an album that is direct, soulful and demands to be played loud.\n\nThe themes of songs like the title track, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Steal My Shine\u201d and \u201cI Suffer I Get Tougher\u201d offer the antidote to today\u2019s hard times by touting \u201cperseverance, inspiration and hope\u2026 being your authentic self despite everything lined against you, a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d With a vocal style reflecting both the soulfulness and bite of his idols, Rev has added world-class singer to his already-renowned skills as a finger-pickin\u2019 guitar\nphenom. Breezy and Max also contribute background vocals to most of the songs, with \u201cThe Miss Elizabeth of Country Blues\u201d actually taking the spotlight with a sultry call-and- response showcase on \u201cDirty Swerve,\u201d in which she also contributed to the writing.\n\nPeyton's blues pedigree is well established. Woodshedding since he was 12, Peyton has kept alive a tradition of finger picking pioneered by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt. However, Peyton plays with the energy and attitude of a Howlin' Wolf. Indeed if it has strings he can play it whether that's a custom-built National, a cigarbox, an axe or even a shotgun (seriously, Google it.).\n\nHe's done his homework and been given the blessing of the gatekeepers of the tradition \u2014 even befriending and touring with some of the last of the great Delta Blues and Hill Country blues legends like David \u201cHoneyboy\u201d Edwards, T-Model Ford (whose grandson calls him Unk), and Robert Belfour.\n\nRev and Breezy make their home in rural southern Indiana near the adopted home of bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, among national parks and forests in what began as an artist\u2019s colony. \u201cMost of the people here can both paint a picture and skin a deer,\u201d laughs Breezy.\n\nTheres nothing dusty or sentimental about Peyton's music, though. Theres no songs about picking cotton. They aren't a museum piece. The Big Damn Band have taken nearly a century of blues songsmanship and crafted a thing all their own. There is not a single act out there that sounds like this.\n\nThe Big Damn Band make friends and fans every place they go \u2014 and there are few places they haven't been, having performed in 37 countries. After Poor Until Payday, the only people who won't be on the big damn bandwagon will be people who haven't heard or aren't paying attention.\n\nThis is real, from the heart, handmade music made by people, for people who don\u2019t have time for BS.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Maddie Poppe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9329274.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Indie Pop", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "My album Whirlwind is out now!\n\nhttp://hollywoodrecs.co/Whirlwind", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Josie Dunne ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8529658.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "http://instagram.com/josiedunne http://www.youtube.com/JosieDunneMusic https://twitter.com/josieDunneMusic", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "J.

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SAMIA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8201231.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Alternative, Folk, Indie, Rock, Indie Pop", "Time": "10:59 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "my friend ian said that I'm the last remaining rockstar on earth and he's usually right but he said it not me", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Torres ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9397833.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie, Rock, Art Rock, Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "TORRES is the creative alter-ego of Brooklyn-based Mackenzie Scott.

Townes (born January 22, 1965 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), also known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, is an American hip hop and R&B record producer and turntablist. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia where he is enshrined in the school's \"Wall of Fame\".\n\nHistory\n\nWhen he was growing up, he found that listening to his parents was unbearable. He got a job as a newspaper boy at age 7 to support his family. Once he grew up, he developed a reputation and following as a school and block party DJ extraordinaire, Jazzy Jeff was the feature of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. As a duo, they had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy ever presented in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand. When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Jazzy Jeff played a recurring character named \"Jazz\", Smith's best friend on the show. The two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back/snap with both characters saying \"Pssh!\").\n\nJazz' trademarks include being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), screaming as he went flying out the front door. This was referenced in the song \"N.Y, N.Y.\" by Lloyd Banks from his second album Rotten Apple, with the lyric \"I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff\". [1]\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff is not to be confused with Jeffrey Myree from the earlier hip hop group Funky Four Plus One, which in fact filed and won a lawsuit over the name Jazzy Jeff against Jeff Townes and Jive records when they signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. After DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&B, soul, and neo soul record producer, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Jill Scott and Musiq. Even though he separated from Will Smith as music partners, they are still best friends and still occasionally work together. Some songs by Will Smith were produced by Jeff Townes (Ex. Here He Comes), and he has performed on some songs by Will Smith such as \"So Fresh\" and \"Potnas\". In addition, he appears in several of Smith's music videos such as \"Will2K\", \"Freakin' It\", and \"Party Starter\". On some occasions, he makes appearances with Smith on live concerts, producing DJ scratches.\n\nHe, along with DJ Cash Money, is credited with making the transform scratch famous.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. In the past, Will has performed on concerts with DJ Jazzy Jeff for the scratches. Moreover, Will acknowledges him in his music like \"Comin' To The Stage\" from the album Lost & Found or \"Potnas\" in his album Willennium.\n\nHis 2007 release TROTM (The Return of the Magnificent) is a classic work which returns to the roots of hip-hop with a neo-soul mixture included. This album featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Crakk (a remake of Brand New Funk), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in the video DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Fest directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest and they reveal that they are working on an album together called \"I'm the DJ, I'm the Rapper\".\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo work as DJ Jazzy Jeff\n\n* Unreleased album from Sony Records (1998)\n* One cut in Battle of DJs\n* The Magnificent (2002)\n* Soulheaven Presents Jazzy Jeff in the House (2004)\n* The Soul Mixtape Groovin' Records USA (2005)\n* Hip-Hop Forever II Rapster Records (2004)\n* Hip-Hop Forever III BBE Records (2006)\n* The Return of The Magnificent EP (2007)\n* The Return of the Magnificent (2007)\n* The Return of Hip Hop EP (2007)\n\n\nAs DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince\n\n* Rock the House (1987) #83 US (Gold)\n* He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper (1988) #4 US (3x Platinum)\n* And in This Corner\u2026 (1989) #39 US (Gold)\n* Homebase (1991) #12 US (Platinum)\n* Code Red (1993) #64 US (Gold)\n* Greatest Hits (1998) #144 US, #20 UK\n* Before The Willennium (1999)\n* The Very Best of D.J.

Townes (born January 22, 1965 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), also known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, is an American hip hop and R&B record producer and turntablist. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia where he is enshrined in the school's \"Wall of Fame\".\n\nHistory\n\nWhen he was growing up, he found that listening to his parents was unbearable. He got a job as a newspaper boy at age 7 to support his family. Once he grew up, he developed a reputation and following as a school and block party DJ extraordinaire, Jazzy Jeff was the feature of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. As a duo, they had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy ever presented in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand. When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Jazzy Jeff played a recurring character named \"Jazz\", Smith's best friend on the show. The two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back/snap with both characters saying \"Pssh!\").\n\nJazz' trademarks include being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), screaming as he went flying out the front door. This was referenced in the song \"N.Y, N.Y.\" by Lloyd Banks from his second album Rotten Apple, with the lyric \"I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff\". [1]\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff is not to be confused with Jeffrey Myree from the earlier hip hop group Funky Four Plus One, which in fact filed and won a lawsuit over the name Jazzy Jeff against Jeff Townes and Jive records when they signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. After DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&B, soul, and neo soul record producer, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Jill Scott and Musiq. Even though he separated from Will Smith as music partners, they are still best friends and still occasionally work together. Some songs by Will Smith were produced by Jeff Townes (Ex. Here He Comes), and he has performed on some songs by Will Smith such as \"So Fresh\" and \"Potnas\". In addition, he appears in several of Smith's music videos such as \"Will2K\", \"Freakin' It\", and \"Party Starter\". On some occasions, he makes appearances with Smith on live concerts, producing DJ scratches.\n\nHe, along with DJ Cash Money, is credited with making the transform scratch famous.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. In the past, Will has performed on concerts with DJ Jazzy Jeff for the scratches. Moreover, Will acknowledges him in his music like \"Comin' To The Stage\" from the album Lost & Found or \"Potnas\" in his album Willennium.\n\nHis 2007 release TROTM (The Return of the Magnificent) is a classic work which returns to the roots of hip-hop with a neo-soul mixture included. This album featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Crakk (a remake of Brand New Funk), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in the video DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Fest directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest and they reveal that they are working on an album together called \"I'm the DJ, I'm the Rapper\".\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo work as DJ Jazzy Jeff\n\n* Unreleased album from Sony Records (1998)\n* One cut in Battle of DJs\n* The Magnificent (2002)\n* Soulheaven Presents Jazzy Jeff in the House (2004)\n* The Soul Mixtape Groovin' Records USA (2005)\n* Hip-Hop Forever II Rapster Records (2004)\n* Hip-Hop Forever III BBE Records (2006)\n* The Return of The Magnificent EP (2007)\n* The Return of the Magnificent (2007)\n* The Return of Hip Hop EP (2007)\n\n\nAs DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince\n\n* Rock the House (1987) #83 US (Gold)\n* He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper (1988) #4 US (3x Platinum)\n* And in This Corner\u2026 (1989) #39 US (Gold)\n* Homebase (1991) #12 US (Platinum)\n* Code Red (1993) #64 US (Gold)\n* Greatest Hits (1998) #144 US, #20 UK\n* Before The Willennium (1999)\n* The Very Best of D.J.

A philosophy derived from the Japanese art of repairing cracked ceramics with gold to highlight flaws instead of hiding them, kintsugi speaks to the way an object's history is part of its aesthetic value. \"Considering what we were going through internally, and with what a lot of the lyrics are about, it had a great deal of resonance for us \u2014 the idea of figuring out how to repair breaks and make them a thing of beauty,\" says bassist Nick Harmer, who suggested the name to singer-guitarist Ben Gibbard and drummer Jason McGerr. \"Philosophically, spiritually, emotionally, it seems perfect for this group of songs.\"\nLong before they gave the album its name, the band embarked on a process that forced them to do things differently than they ever had before. For instance, in the course of making their seven previous albums, the Seattle band hadn't written much in the studio together. They had always preferred to hone their arrangements separately, or with just two or three of them playing at once. But when it came time to record Kintsugi, Death Cab for Cutie went into the studio with the openest of minds. Their willingness to try anything \u2014 including a twenty-minute exploration that evolved into one of the album's finest tracks, \"The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive\" \u2014 yields Death Cab's most compelling new work in years: an album that packs as much sonic as it does emotional wallop.\nKintsugi is the band's first time recording with a producer other than their own Chris Walla, the guitarist and multi-instrumentalist whose talents behind the board had helped shape Death Cab's sound since Gibbard released the You Can Play These Songs With Chords cassette in 1997. For Kintsugi, they worked with Rich Costey (whose production credits include albums by Franz Ferdinand, Muse, and Interpol), recording at his Los Angeles studio Eldorado over the course of twelve weeks in the first half of 2014. \"He was all in in a way that I don't think a lot of producers are nowadays,\" says Gibbard. \"We couldn't have landed on a better collaborator for this record. He accomplished what we've always attempted, which is to make Death Cab sound on a record how we sound live. And we're a rock band live. The difficulty now for the live show is making them rock as hard as they rock on the record. That's a new quagmire for this band.\"\nWork on Kintsugi began back in early 2013, as all Death Cab LPs have, with Gibbard writing and demoing the songs on his own before arranging and recording them with his band mates. They initially convened in fall of 2013 at Walla's Hall Of Justice studio in Seattle. Ten days into recording, Chris decided to step down as producer. Says Gibbard. \"Nothing dramatic, he just said, 'I don't think I'm the right guy to do this album and we should find someone else.'\" The band all felt that they needed to shake things up a bit. \"We challenged each other more and left no stone unturned. That was as gratifying as it was frustrating at times, but I couldn't be happier with the end product,\" says McGerr. Walla has since decided to leave the band but participated in the recording process as fully and vitally as he had on their previous albums. In fact, Costey didn't even know Walla was leaving the band until after Kintsugi was finished. Chris played his final show with the band in September at Rifflandia Festival in British Columbia.\nWhen they started recording, there weren't any rules at all. They'd work on a song for a while and then regroup with Costey to figure out elements to expand or elaborate. \"These guys have a chemistry that's existed for a long time, and that chemistry can't be ignored,\" says Costey. \"When you have a band that can play as well as they can play with each other, having them jam together in real time can actually be the quickest way to try a bunch of ideas and get them on tape.\" Songs such as the instantly memorable \"Good Help (Is So Hard To Find),\" the warm and vulnerable \"Little Wanderer\" and the brooding lead single \"Black Sun\" were all tracked with the four members of the band playing together in a room, reacting to each other in real time, adding layers \u2014 and later subtracting some. \"All four of us being on the floor together in the studio was something that hadn't happened in years, because Chris was always behind the glass or in the control room,\" says McGerr. \"But this was more like when we're onstage, where everyone has their eyes closed and we're playing in the moment. With 'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive,' it turned into a twenty-minute thing they captured in the control room on a two-track. We had started it in Seattle months prior and it just wasn't getting there. Rich brought us into the control room and was like, 'This is our song.'\"\nCostey credits another element of their production set-up with helping achieve the perfect balance of their classic approach and the new one: \"My studio has one big live recording space and two control rooms,\" he says. \"Once we got basic tracks together, Chris would work on them in the other control room. And he would end up doing completely different versions of the songs. For 'Black Sun,' Chris did all this super old school sequenced synth stuff that we used on the final track, and it really brought that song to another level.\"\n\"Black Sun\" is also a perfect example of Gibbard's customarily honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. \"'Black Sun' is about divorce and the ugliness and conflicting emotions that come with that: anger, sadness, finger-pointing, acceptance, forgiveness, understanding. To me, the idea of a black sun has multiple meanings: The black sun could be an eclipse, where one thing eclipses another. The sun is supposed to be a radiating light on the world but in this instance it is blacked out. We've all been that at some point in our life when we're supposed to be shining upon someone giving them support, but for some reason are unable to do that. I am the black sun, and the song is as much an indictment of myself as anything.\"\nAlthough, in the case of \"Black Sun,\" Gibbard says he's willing to elaborate on the elements of the song that are autobiographical, he's never been one to reveal the precise meaning behind his lyrics. \"I know that people will assume these songs are about certain things, and in some instances they are going to be correct,\" he says. \"But I'm not going to give people a road map.\"\nGibbard acknowledges that, early on in the process of writing this group of songs, as he was still trying to make sense of the major changes happening in his life, he had to remind himself not to change his creative process. \"If there's a reason people can relate to my songwriting, maybe it's they feel like they're getting an honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. I'm certainly not going to censor that just because people think they know something about my personal life. I would be cowardly as a songwriter and not be true to what I've always done if I shy away from these events in my life because I was in relationship with a public figure.\n\"I know the lyrics aren't 100% fiction and they're not 100% nonfiction, and only Ben knows what that blend is,\" says Harmer. \"But with this group of songs, I do think he is writing from a genuinely vulnerable and honest place and I'm proud of him for putting himself out there and being fearless about it.\"\nOne of the songs on Kintsugi that Gibbard says he holds closest to his heart is \"Little Wanderer,\" where he sings, \"You sent a photo out of your window of Paris of what you wished that I could see. But someone's gotta be the lighthouse and that someone's gotta be me.\" He explains: \"There are innumerable songs about, like, 'The road ain't no place to start a family.' 'Home Sweet Home' by Motley Crue, 'Gone Til November,' by Wyclef Jean, and so on. But nobody ever writes a song about sitting at home, waiting for someone to come back. And for so much of my life, I've been the one off somewhere in the world trying to maintain a connection through digital portals. Now, being with someone who travels pretty much all the time, I feel like I've gotten a taste of my own medicine. All the songs are personal, but that one is personal in a way that is very tender to me.\"\nHere, too, \"The Ghosts of Beverly Drive\" encapsulates important elements of the album's larger theme \u2014 embracing flaws and being open to change. \"If only you had known me before the accident,\" it begins, \"for with that grand collision came a grave consequence.\" Says Gibbard: \"There's this charade you play with someone when you start seeing each other, that no one has ever made you feel this way before,\" says Gibbard. \"'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive' is about when you say to the person you're with, 'Let's just acknowledge that we are not the first people to feel this way. Let's be honest with each other that we've been in love before or that we've fallen out of love with people before, and that's OK.'\"", "otherInfo": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking forward to playing this Thursday\u2019s Live From Home show at 4pm PT!\n\nThis week\u2019s livestream is in benefit of Community Lunch, a non-profit that provides hot, nutritious meals and survival services to those experiencing homelessness and low-income people in Seattle.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Eight years after that impromptu busking session, the Portland, Oregon-based quintet has grown from a rootsy, string-centric outfit to a full-fledged rock band with an easy but powerful grasp of soul, blues, and British Invasion era pop. On their new album Labor of Love, Fruition shows the complete force of their newly expanded and electrified sound, matching their more daring musicality with sophisticated, melody-minded songcraft. With Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja trading vocal duties and offering up their own singular brand of gutsy yet graceful songwriting, Fruition infuse each track on Labor of Love with timeless urgency and three-part harmonies that never fail to enthrall.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2013 album Just One of Them Nights, Labor of Love came to life over the course of a year-long process of exploring new sonic terrain that included everything from Phil Spector-esque pop to dreamy psychedelia to Motown-inspired soul. \u201cIn the past our approach was always to just get in the studio and get it done, but for this one we decided we were going to take all the time in the world to make the album great,\u201d says Anderson. Teaming up with engineer Justin Phelps (Amanda Palmer, Jolie Holland, Chuck Prophet), Fruition self-produced Labor of Love and mined major inspiration from the inventive precision of longtime Beatles producer George Martin. \u201cThis is the first album where we made a point of bringing out the character of each song to the fullest,\u201d says Thompson, who helmed the mixing of the album. \u201cWith our previous albums we tended to treat each song the same, but this time we really went all the way with whatever sound we were going for.\u201d\n\nDespite pushing into so many disparate directions, Labor of Love emerges as a wholly unified album that subtly imparts the sense of being swept along on a journey. That unity\u2019s got much to do with an open-hearted spirit that sets in from the first notes of the dobro, mandolin and electric guitar driven title track, carries on to the sleepy soul of \u201cSanta Fe,\u201d then unfolds into the beautifully epic balladry of \u201cThe Meaning.\u201d Another key factor in the album\u2019s journey-like feel: Fruition\u2019s ingenious use of between-song transitions, such as the Brazilian-style percussion that lifts Labor of Love from the breezy R&B of \u201cAbove the Line\u201d to the joyful worldbeat-folk of \u201cThe Way That I Do.\u201d \u201cWe brought in a local band called Tapwater one night and enlisted their samba line,\u201d recalls Asebroek. \u201cThey taught us all the drum parts and about ten of us formed a whole drumline, which was just a really fun and unique experience for the band.\u201d\n\nThough Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja each bring a distinct sensibility and boldly nuanced lyricism to their respective songs, a mood of warm melancholy instills much of Labor of Love. \u201cA common theme for all three songwriters is trying to embrace being out on the road all the time, but also feeling like you\u2019re missing out on the everyday lifestyle that most people get to have,\u201d says Leonard. Embedded within that tension is a wistful romanticism that imbues many of the album\u2019s songs. \u201cMost of the love songs are very much about those rare moments of getting to be with the people you love,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cAnd then other songs are about coming back to the people you love, and trying to deal with the strange ways things change because of being apart.\u201d The band chose Labor of Love\u2019s title to reflect that balance of sacrifice and satisfaction, Naja points out. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep nearly enough and we\u2019re away all the time and we do work really hard,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s our job, and it\u2019s pretty much the best job in the world.\u201d\n\nAll near-lifelong musicians, the members of Fruition came to Portland from varied corners of the country and gradually crossed paths by way of their adopted hometown\u2019s music scene. \u201cMimi and Kellen were going to busk one day and I went along with them, \u2018cause that\u2019s what we always did to pay for that night\u2019s dinner and drinks,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cSo we started playing and just instantly nailed these three-part harmonies, to the point where we\u2019d get done with a song and burst out laughing at how good it sounded.\u201d The magic of those harmonies ended up proving instrumental in rounding out the rest of the band. \u201cThe first time I ever played with them, we were jamming in a friend\u2019s attic and the harmonies surrounded me,\u201d says Thompson, who joined Fruition in 2011. \u201cI had goosebumps for an hour afterward, and I decided right then I was quitting my other band and moving to Portland.\u201d Releasing their debut EP Hawthorne Hoedown in 2008, Fruition devoted the coming years to relentlessly writing and performing, The band moved from busking on the street, to scraping their way onto the lower levels of festival lineups, to opening tours for bands like ALO and Greensky Bluegrass and onward to being invited to play bigger festivals with ever bigger billing on those lineups. Last year saw them appear at Bonnaroo, Northwest String Summit and Telluride Bluegrass where Rolling Stone cited their artful choice of covers and \u201craucous originals filled with heartfelt lyrics and stadium-worthy energy.\u201d This year will see them share a Red Rocks bill with JJ Grey and Mofro and The Infamous Stringdusters, along with a full headline tour of the United States.\n\nThat breadth of touring experience has steadily reshaped the band and ultimately allowed them to achieve a sound they\u2019ve long aspired toward. \u201cA few of the songs on the new album actually came from years ago, in an era when we were much more of a string band,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019d imagined the songs in a particular way but didn\u2019t have the ability or experience to get them where we wanted to be\u2014we didn\u2019t even own the right instruments.\u201d But despite broadening their repertoire, a certain spirited simplicity still forms the heart of Fruition. \u201cWe all tend to write on acoustic guitar and let things start in the same stripped-down, folky sort of way that we always did,\u201d says Naja. \u201cSo where the songs come from hasn\u2019t really changed much at all. What\u2019s different is where we let them go from there.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Palaver Strings ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9901957.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Palaver has always played chamber music in unusual spaces, from impossibly-small living rooms to abandoned warehouses.

Together with founding Nitty Gritty Dirt Band member Les Thompson, Andrew's band Beyond Borders expands that range dramatically, blending an eclectic mix of acoustic and electric instruments along with crisp arrangements and tight 3 and 4-part harmony.\n\nSince permanently leaving his corporate environmental engineering career in 1996, the award-winning folk and Americana artist's musical journey has traced over half a million miles of blue highways and small towns, and earned him a wealth of critical acclaim and enthusiastic fan response for his five CDs and captivating performances.\n\nWherever McKnight takes the stage, audiences are at once spellbound and relaxed by his entertaining rural stories delivered with just the right touches of down home humor, causing one concertgoer to label him \"equal parts Robert Frost, William Least Heat-Moon and Jeff Foxworthy!\"\n\nOver his 15-year career he has enjoyed many accolades within the folk music world; Folk Alliance International Performance Alley Showcase (2010), 2011 Southeast and 2009 Northeast Regional Folk Alliance Formal Showcases, a Performing Songwriter Top 12 DIY selection and the Rocky Mountain Folks Festival Songwriter Showcase, Kerrville New Folk Finalist and Falcon Ridge Emerging Artist. Andrew and his band & Beyond Borders are members of the prestigious Virginia Commission for the Arts Touring Assistance Program. His five solo CDs have earned much critical acclaim and airplay around the world as well as a wealth of NPR stations and several XM/Sirius satellite shows.\n\nTaking his cue from the lyrics of his award-winning song \"Good Things Matter\", he often shares his talents both on the road and close to home near northwestern Virginia's Blue Ridge to help \"neighbors in need\", such as local programs for mental health and elder care, a Massachusetts community radio station, a California at-risk youth program, and a suburban Seattle food bank.\n\nIn addition to his passion for community causes, he is a longtime advocate for preserving American landscapes and heritage. Several of McKnight's songs are rooted in Appalachian history and culture, including the haunting Civil War ballad \"The Road to Appomattox\". He has also long been active in helping find solutions to the Appalachian agony of mountaintop removal coal mining.\n\nThose passions, and the thoughtful ways he expresses them, have drawn legions of fans who sustain his independent career. In the early 90s Andrew grasped the power of the internet to grow and connect with a loyal listenership, and his career has blossomed largely through their \"efangelism\" instead of the traditional elements of the music business. Many friends and fans even host concerts in their homes for 30 to 50 listeners, venues he refers to as \u201csafe houses on the folk underground railroad\u201d.\n\nWhile no stranger to elite stages like the Kennedy Center, the Rocky Mountain Folks Festival or the Katharine Hepburn Theater, McKnight's music seems to spread most rapidly through many of the diverse causes that have embraced his music over the years. He's been recently profiled in a Wine Compass video episode with his friends at Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, his song \"Made by Hand\" is in 'Low Coal', a new movie about the West Virginia coalfields, and \"Good Things Matter\" was featured in a recent podcast of Bread for the World, a global faith-based organization working to end hunger. His environmental anthem \"The Other Way\" appears on 'Songs from the Tackle Box', a 2010 compilation CD dedicated to fisherman and responsible stewardship of America's rivers and resources.\n\nHis music is heard on hundreds of broadcast and internet radio programs around the world including many National Public Radio stations, XM Satellite, and the nationally syndicated \"Art of the Song\" and \"River City Folk\".\n\nIn addition to his own performing and recording career, Andrew has produced or performed on recordings by many different artists, been a contributing writer for Blue Ridge Country and Americana Rhythm magazines, and is a sought-after clinician for songwriting and music business workshops.

Inspired not only by his country roots, but also the guitar-heavy stomp of Oasis, the reverb-heavy wash of Ryan Adams, the rhythmic punch of the Black Keys, and the anthemic swell of Kings of Leon, Nail and the Well Ravens co-wrote a collection of songs that placed a contemporary spin on older sounds. The result is David Nail\u2019s most sonically adventurous work to date, as well as his first release as an independent artist. He\u2019s a country crooner one moment, an indie rocker the next, and a diversely compelling frontman throughout. Most importantly, he\u2019s an artist following his muse, making music without rules or regulations.\n\nPreorder the new album 'Only This and Nothing More' here: https://davidnail.lnk.to/OnlyThisAndNothingMore", "otherInfo": "Live with David Nail"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Clarks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9069822.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Alt Country Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Early on, The Clarks were once described as a bunch of out of tune country hicks.

But lately, it\u2019s all been a blessing. That wasn\u2019t the case at the start of his\nmusical journey.\nLiving a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle eventually caused the artist to hit rock bottom. \u201cAt rock bottom,\u201d\nJason says, \u201cThat's where I began recovering from a place of hopelessness.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt is also\nwhere I discovered that it was not God who left me, but I who left Him.\u201d He went from a rising\nstar with a lucrative record contract, to being addicted and homeless on the streets of Atlanta,\nto finding redemption through Grace \u2013 and now he shares that story through his music.\nFowler grew up in a musical family and notes, \u201cMy dad sings like Pavarotti, my Uncle Mike\ntaught me guitar, and my Uncle Chris has a doctorate in musical performance. Some of my ear-\nliest memories were at my granny\u2019s house, with everyone singing and dancing to \u201cPony Boy\u201d by\nThe Allman Brothers Band.\nWhen Fowler was sixteen he heard a friend playing Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d\non guitar. This sparked his musical fire and Jason bought his first guitar. Shortly after his dad of-\nfered him a new guitar if he learned to play \u201cJessica,\u201d also by The Allman Brothers Band.\n\u201cI think my dad was hoping I would give him a couple of weeks,\u201d Fowler smiles, \u201cbut I went and\nplayed it for him that night.\u201d\nFowler honed his talents for music and writing as a teen. By his twenties he was working on\nseveral projects and ultimately landed a record deal with his band Ultraphonic. They were pro-\nduced by Bryan Holmes (The Producers) and, coincidentally, Johnny Sandlin, who produced The\nAllman Brothers Band, Widespread Panic and Wet Willie. Fowler and his band spent several\nmonths recording with the legendary \u201cSwampers\u201d at MS Sound in Muscle Shoals, Alabama \u2013\njust like the song.\nThen the unthinkable happened\u2026\nThe record label was bought out and the album was shelved. What seemed to be the pinnacle\nof a life long-held dream, ended up a nightmare of epic proportions. After the breakup of the\nlabel, band, and dreams of stardom, Fowler landed a solo deal with Mil Cannon at Imagemil in\nAtlanta (Usher, Whitney Houston, Carrie Underwood). Fowler was given another chance. With\nexpectations high, Fowler was on his way back, but still carrying his old hurts, habits, and\nhangups, fueled by drugs and alcohol. By this time Jason didn\u2019t know how to live a sober life,\nwhich affected his personal and professional relationships. His tenure at Imagemil didn\u2019t last very long. Mil and members of the Imagemil team confronted Fowler with the facts: he was out\nof control and needed help. They had to let him go.\nFowler\u2019s substance abuse issues did not go away quietly. Over time, he spiraled, ending up\nhomeless and alone. After being kicked out of a drug dealer\u2019s house, Fowler finally waved the\nwhite flag of surrender.\nBroken, lost, and hopeless, Fowler entered a Christian-based rehab in Athens, Georgia, called\nThe Healing Place. He stayed there for an entire year, but it was in that facility where the fog\neventually lifted and Fowler rededicated his life to Jesus. \u201cIt\u2019s like a country song backwards,\u201d\nFowler said. \u201cI started getting things back in my life instead of losing them. I had lost, my rela-\ntionship with God, my family, my friends, and myself.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t a sad ending. This was\nsimply the end of his old life, and a new beginning of Fowler\u2019s career as a Christian artist, a wor-\nship leader and a speaker.\nFowler\u2019s debut solo album, Letters from the Inside (Black Cat Records, 2014), was produced by\nJason Hoard (Third Day, Mac Powell, Jamie Grace, Natalie Grant). Musically it tells his journey\nback from homelessness, addiction, and hopelessness. It took almost five years for Fowler to\nclear his head and his musical passion to return.\n\u201cI was becoming more involved in church and in my recovery. I started feeling like my reason\nfor being here is to praise God,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cBut I also needed to share my story of where I\nwas, what happened, and what it\u2019s like today.\u201d\nThe songs from Letters from the Inside were snapshots of Fowler\u2019s journey and newfound faith.\nThe ten songs were recorded in Griffin, Georgia over a period of two months. Fowler recruited\nlong time friend and drummer Shane Evans, formerly of Collective Soul, as the backbone of the\nalbum and his touring band. The two began to share the message of hope and redemption,\nmostly to young people and up-and-coming musicians who were about to embark on their own\njourneys.\nI Fall In (Rcity Records, 2016) is Fowler\u2019s second album, which took Fowler on a sojourn to\nNashville. It was there where he recorded at Dark Horse Studios with Grammy-nominated pro-\nducer Billy Smiley (White Heart, Johnny Cash, Bebe and Cece Winans). Together they recruited\na heavy-hitter list of talented artists for his sophomore effort, which included Leigh Nash (Six-\npence None the Richer), Will Turpin (Collective Soul), Peter Furler (Newsboys), Steve Brewster\n(Chicago, Bob Seger, Amy Grant), Anthony Sallee (Michael W. Smith, White Heart), Jillian Ed-\nwards, Blair Masters (Casting Crowns, Garth Brooks, Mercy Me), and Jared Kneale (Kacey Mus-\ngrave, Ben Rector), and even his aunt, Joy Waters Fowler, to name just a few. The album also\nprovided an opportunity for Fowler to mend his relationship with Imagemil founder Mil Can-\nnon, who directed Fowler in three music videos.\nThe Nashville adventure also led to a professional collaboration with legendary vocalist John\nSchlitt (Petra, Head East) and Billy Smiley (Whiteheart) to form The Union of Sinners and Saints in 2016. They followed up their 12-song debut album with a nationwide tour of churches and\nvenues, singing, sharing their testimonies and witnessing to fellow Christians about their fame,\nfollies and fellowship.\nJason also shares his writing and performing talents with Will Turpin of Collective Soul on his\nlatest release Serengeti Drivers (Gooey Records, 2018). The two collaborated on five songs and\nplay shows in between their touring schedules.\nFowler spent most of 2019 touring and sharing the \u201cGood News\u201d with JJ Weeks and The Union\nof Sinners and Saints. He is currently working with Dove winning and Grammy nominated pro-\nducers Ian Eskelin and Barry Weeks (Francesca Battistelli, 7eventh Time Down) on his third solo\nalbum slated for a 2020 release.\nFowler says \u201cMusic is the vehicle for the message of Hope\u201d and loves sharing his story of Rock, Recovery, and Redemption.", "otherInfo": "Join me this Thursday, May 21st at 8pm EST!

A self-described \u2018military brat\u2019, Welling\u2019s struggle to feel rooted in any one place carved a unharmonious path of heartbreak, doubt, and insecurity that defined her 20s and early 30s\u2026 a journey that lead to her soul-defining rebirth as an international touring artist with a place to call home in Nashville, TN.\n\nHer bold, sultry voice, reminiscent of Sheryl Crow\u2019s grit, Natalie Maines\u2019 twang, and Stevie Nicks\u2019 heart, is upstaged only by the genuine love and connection this natural performer has with her fans both on and off stage. But embracing confidence has not always been easy for this singer-songwriter, who speaks candidly about her battle to be good to herself, and to quiet the inner voice nagging her to be \u201cperfect\u201d. Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends. Some of them I talk to everyday, and they give me music ideas! They keep me going,\u201d she says, reflecting on the creator-founded platform.\n\nMelodies rich in folksy, Americana roots, paired with empowering, honest lyrics are stunningly showcased in Welling\u2019s forthcoming, full length album High Heels and Heavy Things. Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mister White ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9086812.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Funk, Soul, Instrumental, Disco, Hip Hop, Latin", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Hello everyone, I hope you\u2019re staying healthy both physically and mentally.\n\nDuring this time family and music seems to be the only thing that\u2019s really been keeping me motivated and allowing me to push forward & try new things.

Eight years after that impromptu busking session, the Portland, Oregon-based quintet has grown from a rootsy, string-centric outfit to a full-fledged rock band with an easy but powerful grasp of soul, blues, and British Invasion era pop. On their new album Labor of Love, Fruition shows the complete force of their newly expanded and electrified sound, matching their more daring musicality with sophisticated, melody-minded songcraft. With Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja trading vocal duties and offering up their own singular brand of gutsy yet graceful songwriting, Fruition infuse each track on Labor of Love with timeless urgency and three-part harmonies that never fail to enthrall.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2013 album Just One of Them Nights, Labor of Love came to life over the course of a year-long process of exploring new sonic terrain that included everything from Phil Spector-esque pop to dreamy psychedelia to Motown-inspired soul. \u201cIn the past our approach was always to just get in the studio and get it done, but for this one we decided we were going to take all the time in the world to make the album great,\u201d says Anderson. Teaming up with engineer Justin Phelps (Amanda Palmer, Jolie Holland, Chuck Prophet), Fruition self-produced Labor of Love and mined major inspiration from the inventive precision of longtime Beatles producer George Martin. \u201cThis is the first album where we made a point of bringing out the character of each song to the fullest,\u201d says Thompson, who helmed the mixing of the album. \u201cWith our previous albums we tended to treat each song the same, but this time we really went all the way with whatever sound we were going for.\u201d\n\nDespite pushing into so many disparate directions, Labor of Love emerges as a wholly unified album that subtly imparts the sense of being swept along on a journey. That unity\u2019s got much to do with an open-hearted spirit that sets in from the first notes of the dobro, mandolin and electric guitar driven title track, carries on to the sleepy soul of \u201cSanta Fe,\u201d then unfolds into the beautifully epic balladry of \u201cThe Meaning.\u201d Another key factor in the album\u2019s journey-like feel: Fruition\u2019s ingenious use of between-song transitions, such as the Brazilian-style percussion that lifts Labor of Love from the breezy R&B of \u201cAbove the Line\u201d to the joyful worldbeat-folk of \u201cThe Way That I Do.\u201d \u201cWe brought in a local band called Tapwater one night and enlisted their samba line,\u201d recalls Asebroek. \u201cThey taught us all the drum parts and about ten of us formed a whole drumline, which was just a really fun and unique experience for the band.\u201d\n\nThough Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja each bring a distinct sensibility and boldly nuanced lyricism to their respective songs, a mood of warm melancholy instills much of Labor of Love. \u201cA common theme for all three songwriters is trying to embrace being out on the road all the time, but also feeling like you\u2019re missing out on the everyday lifestyle that most people get to have,\u201d says Leonard. Embedded within that tension is a wistful romanticism that imbues many of the album\u2019s songs. \u201cMost of the love songs are very much about those rare moments of getting to be with the people you love,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cAnd then other songs are about coming back to the people you love, and trying to deal with the strange ways things change because of being apart.\u201d The band chose Labor of Love\u2019s title to reflect that balance of sacrifice and satisfaction, Naja points out. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep nearly enough and we\u2019re away all the time and we do work really hard,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s our job, and it\u2019s pretty much the best job in the world.\u201d\n\nAll near-lifelong musicians, the members of Fruition came to Portland from varied corners of the country and gradually crossed paths by way of their adopted hometown\u2019s music scene. \u201cMimi and Kellen were going to busk one day and I went along with them, \u2018cause that\u2019s what we always did to pay for that night\u2019s dinner and drinks,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cSo we started playing and just instantly nailed these three-part harmonies, to the point where we\u2019d get done with a song and burst out laughing at how good it sounded.\u201d The magic of those harmonies ended up proving instrumental in rounding out the rest of the band. \u201cThe first time I ever played with them, we were jamming in a friend\u2019s attic and the harmonies surrounded me,\u201d says Thompson, who joined Fruition in 2011. \u201cI had goosebumps for an hour afterward, and I decided right then I was quitting my other band and moving to Portland.\u201d Releasing their debut EP Hawthorne Hoedown in 2008, Fruition devoted the coming years to relentlessly writing and performing, The band moved from busking on the street, to scraping their way onto the lower levels of festival lineups, to opening tours for bands like ALO and Greensky Bluegrass and onward to being invited to play bigger festivals with ever bigger billing on those lineups. Last year saw them appear at Bonnaroo, Northwest String Summit and Telluride Bluegrass where Rolling Stone cited their artful choice of covers and \u201craucous originals filled with heartfelt lyrics and stadium-worthy energy.\u201d This year will see them share a Red Rocks bill with JJ Grey and Mofro and The Infamous Stringdusters, along with a full headline tour of the United States.\n\nThat breadth of touring experience has steadily reshaped the band and ultimately allowed them to achieve a sound they\u2019ve long aspired toward. \u201cA few of the songs on the new album actually came from years ago, in an era when we were much more of a string band,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019d imagined the songs in a particular way but didn\u2019t have the ability or experience to get them where we wanted to be\u2014we didn\u2019t even own the right instruments.\u201d But despite broadening their repertoire, a certain spirited simplicity still forms the heart of Fruition. \u201cWe all tend to write on acoustic guitar and let things start in the same stripped-down, folky sort of way that we always did,\u201d says Naja. \u201cSo where the songs come from hasn\u2019t really changed much at all.

Several of McKnight's songs are rooted in Appalachian history and culture, including the haunting Civil War ballad \"The Road to Appomattox\". He has also long been active in helping find solutions to the Appalachian agony of mountaintop removal coal mining.\n\nThose passions, and the thoughtful ways he expresses them, have drawn legions of fans who sustain his independent career.

He's been recently profiled in a Wine Compass video episode with his friends at Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, his song \"Made by Hand\" is in 'Low Coal', a new movie about the West Virginia coalfields, and \"Good Things Matter\" was featured in a recent podcast of Bread for the World, a global faith-based organization working to end hunger. His environmental anthem \"The Other Way\" appears on 'Songs from the Tackle Box', a 2010 compilation CD dedicated to fisherman and responsible stewardship of America's rivers and resources.\n\nHis music is heard on hundreds of broadcast and internet radio programs around the world including many National Public Radio stations, XM Satellite, and the nationally syndicated \"Art of the Song\" and \"River City Folk\".\n\nIn addition to his own performing and recording career, Andrew has produced or performed on recordings by many different artists, been a contributing writer for Blue Ridge Country and Americana Rhythm magazines, and is a sought-after clinician for songwriting and music business workshops.

Billed not as a solo album, but as a project by David Nail and the Well Ravens, Only This and Nothing More finds its frontman leaving behind the familiar comfort of his longtime record label and, instead, uncovering new ground with help from two longtime partners; multi-instrumentalist Andrew Petroff and producer Jason Hall. Inspired not only by his country roots, but also the guitar-heavy stomp of Oasis, the reverb-heavy wash of Ryan Adams, the rhythmic punch of the Black Keys, and the anthemic swell of Kings of Leon, Nail and the Well Ravens co-wrote a collection of songs that placed a contemporary spin on older sounds.

So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll.

Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life. The Denver Post raved that the group created \u201csome of the most exciting original music in Colorado,\u201d while Westword proclaimed that their live show was a \u201cclinic in roots rock mixed with old-school swing and blues,\u201d and Seattle NPR station KEXP hailed \u201cCowles\u2019 Otis Redding and Sam Cooke inspired vocals.\u201d The band released two albums and toured nationally before they called it quits and amicably went their separate ways.\n\nThe parting was a necessary but difficult one for Cowles. In the ensuing months and years, he would find himself alone more than ever before, at one point living out of his Chevy Tahoe just to make ends meet. But rather than break him, the experience only strengthened his resolve. \"High to Low\u201d gives the listener a real sense of Brent\u2019s current mood.

Blue Water Highway\u2019s music is the soundtrack for their lives.\n\n\u201cBest Friend\u201d is the first single from their album Heartbreak City, which came out on Blue Water Highway Records/Thirty Tigers on June 8th, 2018. With a hook that\u2019s a mile wide, it chronicles the lives, loves, and friendships that sustain us. Said lead singer Zack Kibodeaux, \u201cWe wrote this as a band, and we wanted to tap into the feeling of that special friendship where you know you can count on one another.

The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama/Avi & Celia) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center. From 2013-16, Salloway toured the globe with Bombino, the Tuareg guitar hero from Niger, Africa. While on the journey and since returning, Salloway wrote the material on the band\u2019s latest album, Strike the Match (Sand & Gold Records).\n\nSalloway has been bringing these songs to life with the Wylder Family, a group of dear friends and musical kindred spirits. In between shows, the band spent ten days recording at Eyeland Studio in the Columbus Theatre, home of The Low Anthem. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert: think Andrew Bird meets Ali Farka Toure, Pete Seeger and Talking Heads. Strike the Match expands on American musical traditions, building a bridge to their African roots and coloring the songs with experimental art-rock textures: gilded string lines, synthesizers, and angular guitars. Mother Earth is at its center, surrounded by stories of love, conflict, change and dreams.\n\nSalloway shares, \u201cThis album is a reflection of the world we\u2019ve been born into, one filled with supernatural beauty and incomprehensible struggle. My social and environmental activism work has taken me to territories that have been colonized and occupied in the Middle East, North and West Africa, the South Pacific and Standing Rock, here at home. I have experienced the creative spirit rise up in the face of darkness and adversity and it is the most life-affirming feeling I have witnessed. This record has become the artifact at the intersection of these moving events in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Strike the Match, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most pressing questions of our time. How can we reorient ourselves to nature as a source of strength for resistance to the forces that seek to destroy and profit from it? How can we use music to move beyond capitalism and nationalism to a global society for the benefit of the earth and all living beings? How can we reconcile our painful history with hope and optimism for the future? The album calls the listener to engage with these questions and illuminates the path towards participating in the creation of a more just and sustainable world.\n\nThe band is named after Salloway\u2019s grandmother, Wilma \u201cBillie\u201d Hotaling.\u201d She was a prolific painter, author, musician, and educator. Billie wrote Count the Stars Through the Cracks, a harrowing historical fiction novel about a young brother and sister\u2019s escape from the Antebellum South along the Underground Railroad. Billie\u2019s writing was raw and fearless and her book delivered a powerful narrative about America\u2019s hard truths and the long journey to freedom. \u201cMy grandma Billie led by example, showing me what creativity looks like and how critical art can be as a form of love and resistance. She is part of me and part of the Wylder family,\u201d Salloway reflects.\n\n\u201cRaised in a progressive home and taught to play by Pete and John Seeger, activism is a constant in Avi Salloway\u2019s life and art. During the past decade, he\u2019s performed in world crisis spots, from the Palestinian territories to Standing Rock, always delivering a message of music\u2019s power to heal and bring change.\u201d \u2013The Hippo\n\n\"Engaging mash-up of various strains of American folk and rock and Tuareg desert blues.\" \u2013The Boston Globe", "otherInfo": "Tune in Thursday, May 21 to catch Avi live on the ZenBarn facebook page.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

It was in that spirit that Matt Maher birthed his latest album, Saints and Sinners (Essential/Sony).\n\nThe garage-turned-studio behind Maher\u2019s home became a haven of reflection as he tirelessly transformed it into a creative songwriting space. \u201cEvery day, I\u2019d go out there and dream a bit and ask, \u2018God, what do you want to build here?\u2019\u201d Maher recalls. \u201cI thought a lot about the nature of what it means to build something, and I didn\u2019t have a clear sense of where I was headed. I found myself in a place of unknowing,\u201d Maher says. \u201cSo I naturally started gravitating toward writings and quotes from people having experienced the tension between certainty and mystery.\u201d He began saving these prayers, quotes and excerpts while also studying prophetic voices who significantly impacted the history of the church - believers who wrestled with matters of faith, who challenged the status quo and left marked legacies.\n\nAmidst creativity unfolding, the record-making process began, unbeknownst to Maher, when he stepped into the studio to record a song based on the timeless Bill Gaither hymn \u201cBecause He Lives.\u201d Initially, he was recording the song for a one-off compilation project, but Maher\u2019s label heard the demo and immediately deemed it his next radio single. \u201cAll of a sudden, it was like, \u2018You\u2019re making a record,\u2019 and what\u2019s funny is my first response was, \u2018But I don\u2019t have any songs,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe more I thought about it, I realized I had already begun the writing process for all these songs, based on all these people I had been studying. I just wasn\u2019t aware of how beautifully it was starting to come together.\u201d \u201cBecause He Lives (Amen)\u201d became the catalyst to initiate an entire chain of songwriting sessions based on a short list of difference makers.\n\nMaher brought together a host of talented songwriters among who were Thad Cockrell (Leagues), Jon Foreman (Switchfoot), Bo and Bear Rinehart (NEEDTOBREATHE), Jason Ingram and several others for the project.\n\nWith songs loosely crafted and ready for the studio, Maher collaborated with longtime friend and producer Paul Moak (Third Day, Mat Kearney) to bring to life the themes of unity and the struggle of living in the \u201cin-between.\u201d This duality was not only explored lyrically but also sonically as the two men creatively experimented in-studio on \u201cSaints and Sinners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were looking at the idea of the tension between the saint and the sinner - of looking at two contrasting things, and incorporating that into the production of the music. For example, you take an imperfect being, who generates analog sound waves, and they get recorded into a computer that turns them into digital information. You can create so much within a computer that there is a fine line of tension between it sounding perfect versus human, so we tried to arrive at a reconciliation between the two,\u201d Maher explains.\n\nThe lives and work of other influencers became the blueprint for additional cuts, like the album\u2019s driving first track, \u201cFuture Not My Own,\u201d which is based on a prayer inspired by martyr Oscar Romero. \u201cThis prayer really brings to light that we\u2019re announcing a kingdom that\u2019s here, that\u2019s coming, and that\u2019s being built, that we won\u2019t see the finish of. That\u2019s a huge aspect of being a part of the Church, the body of Christ.\u201d\n\nMaher is an outspoken champion of unity and collaboration, not just amongst Christians on a level of faith but also on a civic level,\u201d he says. Perhaps the most outspoken example of this desire is the gospel-tinged \u201cSons and Daughters.\u201d Although the song was written before the Ferguson incident made headlines, the timely track is an ode to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Maher\u2019s attempt to speak into racial reconciliation. \u201cGod used the church in the \u201960s to inspire a nation for healing. Most people don\u2019t think about the fact that a lot of people in the civil rights movement initially were pastors. Faith was the thing that motivated people toward eradicating injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cSons and Daughters\u201d is a special song, and I hope it will play a part in inspiring more Christian leaders toward re-engagement in the issue of civil rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirelight\u201d is inspired by the ministry of Mother Teresa. Maher\u2019s inspiration for the idea of a firelight comes from her saying, \u201cIf I ever become a saint - I will surely be one of \u2018darkness. I will continually be absent from heaven - to light the light of those in darkness on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything Is Grace\u201d is based on a quote by St. Therese of Lisieux out of \u201cHer Last Conversations\u201d that reads, \u201cEverything is a grace, everything is the direct effect of our father's love - difficulties, contradictions, humiliations, all the soul's miseries, her burdens, her needs - everything, because through them, she learns humility, realizes her weakness. Everything is a grace because everything is God's gift. Whatever be the character of life or its unexpected events - to the heart that loves, all is well.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest\u201d sets Psalm 23 to music and features the vocal harmonies of The Vespers. This song, in particular, came at a time when Maher\u2019s grandmother\u2019s health was failing, and the acoustic-driven track proved to be a source of encouragement for his family.\n\nSince his 2008 major label debut, Maher has become a staple in the artistic and songwriting community. A five time-GRAMMY\u00ae nominee, he has garnered multiple radio successes writing and recording songs like \u201cLord, I Need You,\u201d \u201cHold Us Together,\u201d \u201cChrist Is Risen,\u201d \u201cAll The People Said Amen\u201d and \u201cYour Grace Is Enough.\u201d Maher has penned songs recorded by Chris Tomlin, Crowder, Third Day, Matt Redman, Hillsong, Passion and Meredith Andrews, among others. Maher continues to perform and speak as a part of global high-profile events, including the upcoming World Meeting of Families, marking Pope Francis\u2019 first visit to the US this year. In 2013, Maher performed on stage with Pope Francis in front of more than 3 million people at World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro. Maher and his team are already in the planning stages of participating in World Youth Day 2016 taking place in the summer of 2016 in Krakow, Poland.\n\nMaher has found that while we all come from different backgrounds, amass a range of experiences and even harbor conflicting opinions, the one thing that always binds us together is our humanity. \u201cIt\u2019s the sinful side of me that helps me identify with other broken people and not see myself as better. Christianity doesn\u2019t make me better than anybody else,\u201d he contends. \u201cThe process of being transformed is sometimes a really messy process. When you can remember how far off you were when God found you, your own conversion stands as a testimony to God and mercy, but it also gives you a way to relate to other people.\u201d After all, we were created by a loving God who designed us for a greater purpose. We are each on the pilgrimage of searching out that purpose, being transformed, saints and sinners.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eve Monsees ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mason Lively ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10063648.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Alt-country, Country, Soul-blues, Americana, Country Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Alt-Country Singer/songwriter Mason Lively delivered his compelling debut album, \u201cStronger Ties\u201d on April 6th, 2018.

Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hawksley Workman ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8666929.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Two-time JUNO Award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Hawksley Workman is a staple of the Canadian music and arts scene.

His appreciation for the genre can be traced back to his childhood. Though he enjoyed and was exposed to many types of music, he would listen to artists like Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Ray Price to name a few. Growing up, while being influenced by Blues and Classic Rock, Mason started to take interest and study the songwriting of artists from his home state\u2019s music scene like Robert Earl Keen, Pat Green, Hayes Carll, and many more. As a result, when he started playing guitar at age 14, Mason claims that song-writing \"sort of snuck up on him\" not long after that.\n\nLively is currently in the studio working on his sophomore record with iconic Texas singer/songwriter Wade Bowen, and acclaimed producer Justin Pollard...

The accomplished singer/songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist\u2014a true quadruple threat\u2014released her impactful and emotional debut album Symptoms last year, and it's only the beginning of her journey with a new single and more new music on the way.\n\nBorn and raised in Hawaii, the Los Angeles-based Crowe was practically brought into the world with music in her life: she started playing violin at the young age of three years old, and her father was a concert pianist alongside his career as an astronomer. \"My parents were very musical\u2014they met performing theater together,\" she explains. \"Music was a huge part of our family and my upbringing.\"\n\nAfter teaching herself how to sing while listening to Broadway musical recordings, Crowe eventually got accustomed to performing locally and accrued the confidence and motivation to try her hand at songwriting and music production, with formative influences that included Jewel and Alanis Morrissette. \"They had strong, empowering lyrics,\" she states. \"Jewel had this beautiful voice\u2014all she had to do is grab a guitar and tell her stories. That was mesmerizing to me. Alanis was all about raw, unapologetic emotion and power, and her lyrics were very dynamic while still retaining introspection.\"\n\nIn 2018, Crowe won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest for her song \"Breaking Things,\" which was co-written and co-produced with her partner and first songwriting collaborator Josh Anderson; a year later, she released her debut album Symptoms, the result of two and a half years of work with Anderson in Los Angeles on songs she'd originally written in her bedroom. \"It was my first chapter as a writer, producer, and artist,\" she states while discussing the album's origins. \"It was such a journey to have people around me and a team who could help guide me in this city.\"\n\nA deeply felt and expressive pop album, Symptoms was inspired by Lady Gaga's own approach to production and songwriting: \"She's a powerhouse performer. A lot of my production is inspired by her, along with songwriters like Sia and Taylor Swift\u2014strong women that are powerful, dynamic, and cathartic above all else.\"\n\nSymptoms' title track\u2014as well as the album as a whole\u2014draws from an abusive experience that took place before moving to the West Coast. \"After I went through that experience, my body went into shock and I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety,\" she recalls. \"It was about telling myself that everything was going to be okay\u2014and a musical diary that revealed the ways I was coping with what I'd been through.\"\n\nThe transformative \u201cChess Game,\u201d co-written by Kailey Shaffer, zeroes in on the struggles that young women in the music industry often face, as well as how to transcend and evolve amidst such struggles. As young women in our industry, we felt like we were tired of playing everyone else\u2019s games,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were inspired to write something uplifting\u2014an infectiously driven and empowering anthem in the face of adversity. The symbolism of the lyrics represents transformation, realizing your inner strength and having the courage to take back and own your true power.\u201d The song was an anthem and debuted in the Billboard Dance Charts.\n\n\"Each song is a different piece of a puzzle\u2014a symptom of who I am,\" Crowe continues. \"I took my traumatic experiences and turned them into these fun pop songs to help me get through what I've experienced.\" The latest single from Symptoms, \"Sky Is Falling,\" is particularly close to Crowe's heart; the epic, wide-open ballad finds her drawing from the pain and perseverance of her father's passing. \"It's my most personal song\u2014it encompasses all the things at the core of what I've gone through,\" she explains. I never had the chance to get any closure with him about what had happened to me, and I never got to say goodbye. All my anxiety turned into depression when he died. Because he studied the stars, the title itself is a double meaning. My world was crashing down around me, but I also wanted to make sure the song was uplifting and hopeful.\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for the single is next up, and in Crowe's words, the space-themed clip focuses on \"Finding a connection with that feeling after you experience loss\u2014with that person who may not even be there in the physical form anymore.\" What's next? More new music, starting with a duet with frequent collaborator Nick Mair, \"Can't Find Love\"\u2014as well as continuing to live through the highs and lows of existing, and helping her listeners do the same. \"A lot of things are hard to talk about that we go through, but we can all laugh and cry about it,\" she states. \"It's about letting yourself feel those emotions and coming out stronger from it\u2014feeling more self-assured about who you are.\"", "otherInfo": "Thursday, May 21st\n5:30pm PT\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/roadnationofficial\n\nRoadNation, the pioneering platform that enables artists and fans to build tours together, and A2IM (American Association of Independent Music) have launched the \u201cRoad-Less\u201d livestream series, allowing independent artists to earn money from livestream performances.

There\u2019s one major distinction, however, that separates her from other similarly studied musicians. That is Holly\u2019s devotion to the legendary rock band Phish. Having attended over 300 shows by the Burlington-based quartet, she became obsessed by their famous rendition of \u201cTweezer\u201d from Lake Tahoe on July 31, 2013. It led Holly to transcribe this 37-minute improvisational masterpiece note-for-note and arrange it for solo piano.

Holly\u2019s breathtaking renditions of Phish classics like \u201cIt\u2019s Ice,\u201d \u201cThe Squirming Coil\u201d and \u201cHarry Hood\u201d serve not only as a tribute to the modern day kings of jam, but stand on their own as fully developed classical pieces.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit 3rd and Lindsley, Nashville"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sara Evans ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10276459.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Multi-platinum entertainer SARA EVANS is at the top of her game.

If you ask the two remaining members of The Tragic Radicals, apparently several. A four year revolving door of band members has brought guitarist, Aj Caves, and former TR bassist, turned drummer extraordinaire, Tyler Chittick, to one conclusion; less really is more.\nRewind to the chilly month of January, 2016 in Fullerton, CA: The rock band soon to be known as The Tragic Radicals was born. Since the recent disbanding of her all-girl rock group, The Slivers, Aj, bored and bandless, turned to Craigslist, to scout out musicians for her next (and hopefully more successful) band. With a little diligence, it wasn\u2019t too long before drummer, Nathan, bassist, Tyler, and singer, Cassidy, were assembled, auditioning in Aj\u2019s living room. The band began rehearsing there weekly, and the four-piece picked up and put their scent on, roughly, a dozen of Aj\u2019s existing songs, came up with a suitable moniker, and were hitting stages within a couple of months. Over the next few years, the group played steady gigs, recorded two EPs (one unreleased), and also underwent numerous personnel changes.\nFast forward to late August, 2019: Two singers, four drummers, and nearly one hundred shows later, The Radicals found themselves tragically (or not so tragically) half the band they used to be. Having recently become a three-piece after letting go of their second (and last) singer in June 2019, the band was surprised to see their summer filling up very fast. The new formation of TR soon was gaining momentum as an instrumental act, and was booked solid through the end of August. Promoters were all over them. They were playing venues anywhere from the Sunset Strip to Long Beach, to Orange County, an exciting and unexpected turn of events for a band who was fully anticipating a struggle booking gigs without a vocalist. In a matter of six weeks, with nearly a dozen shows down, the band was nearing the end of their stretch, with only two left on the calendar, both of which at The World Famous Doll Hut in Anaheim, CA. The first of the two shows was one they\u2019d been preparing for. A Saturday night prime slot with a stacked bill, this was an excellent opportunity for The Tragic Radicals to earn some decent exposure, as it promised a great turnout. They did not predict the departure of their drummer on the day of the gig.\nThough blindsided and disappointed, indeed, the show must go on. No stranger to flakey musicians, the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was setting in for the two longest running members of The Tragic Radicals as they had hours to prepare for their performance as a duo. This was not the first time Aj and Tyler had been forced to curb their act on short notice. If one thing has remained constant in TR, it\u2019s etiquette, and there would be no backing out of shows due to the lack of professionalism from other members. Put on the spot, the two would naturally resort to just guitar and bass, jokingly dubbing these modified performances as their \u2018Almost Acoustic Christmas\u2019 shows; for whatever reason, this seemed to happen every December, coincidentally. Even though this was far from their first rodeo, it was clear they began to silently doubt their abilities matching the caliber of the lineup that night, fearing the intensity of their sound would suffer without drums. Consultation between the two was unnecessary as Tyler posed the idea of ditching the bass, and instead doing drums and guitar, and without debate, the musical arrangement was settled.\nWith a packed house, surrounded by many semi-famous musicians, the nervous pair took the stage at The Doll Hut that night, hoping to make it through their set semi-painlessly. The crowd\u2019s growing audible response as each new song was playedLittle did it would prove to be the most successful incarnation of The Tragic Radicals yet. In the months following their impressive, pivotal August performance, The Tragic Radicals would have a new look, a new sound, and a new following. Not to mention, new opportunities. In a very short amount of time, they found their calendar packed once again, filled with not only gigs, but appearances on podcasts like Taxi TV, The Flabby Hoffman Radio Show, Die Laughing Records Radio Podcast, and C4OC\u2019s House of Metal Radio Show. Somehow, they\u2019d managed to achieve more in a matter of weeks than they had as a full band in almost four years-time. It was an exciting time for TR, and finally they began reaping the benefits after years of hard work.\nAnd so it goes, with success comes some criticism. Now and again, skeptics who can\u2019t seem to wrap their heads around how a two-piece, instrumental band, with no vocals or bass will argue that TR cannot compete with the live sound capabilities of a traditional four or five-piece rock band. Aware of the criticism, the pair has had much to prove when it comes to their live act. Eliminating the vocals and bass does present some challenges, but the two-piece is adapting quite well, crafting clever songs with shortened or modified arrangements to make up for the sounds of absent band members. For years Tyler and Aj were frustrated with TR\u2019s inability to expand their song catalog. Due to the constant rotation of members, it was nearly impossible to write new material at the desired pace. Relieved of aforementioned obstacles, The Tragic Radicals are rapidly writing new songs, and are preparing to record and release new music by January 2020. The creative process requires a slightly different approach now, but Aj\u2019s melodic riffs and ability uniquely arrange songs to replace lyrics is a major asset to the band. Playing through both guitar and bass amps on stage, she maintains her distinct guitar tone while incorporating low end to fill the void of Tyler\u2019s missing bass. Perfectly accompaniment, Tyler lends emphasis to accents and dynamics, drumming as though he was playing bass. An incredibly versatile musician, capable of mastering numerous instruments, his skills and flexibility allow him to keep up with Aj\u2019s frequent song reworking and tendency to experiment with time changes. The two manage to captivate audiences with, not only their blatant chemistry, but their genuine, intense stage presence, and roll with the punches charm.", "otherInfo": "Every Thursday We'll Be Playing 3 Original Tracks - Personal Faves, And Requests Welcomed!

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is.

The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

The disbanding of Sister Seven and the release of her first full length solo studio album Fencing Under Fire as well as the recent live unplugged CD Live at the Brushwood Lounge has established Patrice Pike as one of the best independent artists today. Patrice recorded Fencing Under Fire with former band mate and co-owner of her label Zainwayne Records along with Jim Watts and Ethan Allan and released the album in 2002.

Throughout the show, Patrice met a lot of positive review with her performances, including her showcase of her original song, \"Beautiful Thing.\" It was ultimately decided, however, that Patrice was not right for Supernova, and she was eliminated.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

Eric Johnson is now a permanent part of The Shins, although he continues to address the musical adventure that is the Fruit Bats. Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones. In 2006, Johnson became a member of The Shins, but remains committed to the Fruit Bats. The band plans to release a fourth album sometime in the near future.", "otherInfo": "Noise Pop & Wild Little Thing Slightly Sour Ale Present NO PLACE LIKE HOME,\nA Livestream Benefit Series for the Bay Area Music community."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marina V ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10280080.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Pop, Singer & Songwriter, Pop Rock, Russian, Folk, Electronic Pop Indie Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201chauntingly beautiful\u201d ~ L.A.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Z-Trip ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10386724.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Electronic, Hip-hop, Soul, Edm, Bass, Rock, Funk, Turntablism, House, Producer, Reggae", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Z-Trip's roots are based in Hip Hop, but he covers and loves all music styles.

Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd. While in the studio, De la Swing is a solid and fertile mind being in charge of different labels as Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, having also produced and remixed for labels like Form, Drakos Recordings and Amazing Lab. However, his skills and abilities go further on. We can also enjoy its more underground side with his aka \u2018Smoke Signal\u2019, usually as resident in Ker Club Barcelona once a month, sharing his talent with artists such as Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba or Los Suruba.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label. Two Tomatoes moved into a real office in New York City, with real staff including Shannon Chirone, John Waldman (Great Knight Productions), Corinne Barlow, Katie Messer, Michelle Puskas, Justice Longshore, and publicist Elizabeth Waldman Frazier.\n\nIt's one big happy family!", "otherInfo": "Laurie Berkner is doing daily Facebook lives during the COVID-19 school and community closures.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade. Majestic is realising his destiny as one of the biggest talents to come out of the UK underground scene, infinitely more than just the best live MC in the game.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KAMAUU ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9696023.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From the present moment.", "otherInfo": "Live on Instagram"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Papon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mohammed Irfan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8159469.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vishal Dadlani ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9713901.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stephanie Quayle ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10382299.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Biography\n\nAs a member of CMT's Next Women of Country, Stephanie Quayle is an undeniable force on the country music scene.\n\nThe Rebel Engine Entertainment recording artist is one of the most active female artists with a consistent presence on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, and ranks in the Top 10 of Current Female Airplay over the last two years (Mediabase).\n\nThe singer-songwriter is turning heads as an independent artist with repeat performances on the Grand Ole Opry and historic Ryman Auditorium stages, along with hosting for Wrangler Network on the ACM Awards red carpet, as well as hosting for Sounds Like Nashville on the CMT Awards and CMA Awards red carpets.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien.

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic.

Moreover, their 1983 debut album (\u2018Lettin\u2019 Loose\u2019) was co-produced by the creative Mack together with Queen guitarist Brian May. Now, that\u2019s pedigree.\n\nAmazingly, that album has survived more than 20 years of high-speed hi-tech developments intact. While other, more celebrated records have dated badly, \u2018Lettin\u2019 Loose\u2019 re-affirms the belief back then that the Pettin\u2019 would follow Leppard to big time stature. What went wrong at the time has little to do with the band, or lack of ambition/talent.\n\nIn America, where they should have broken big long before Bon Jovi gave Love A Bad Name, they were held back by the label\u2019s insistence on an anaemic re-mix (as well as a title change to \u2018Heavy Pettin\u2019, which caused more confusion than anything else). If the band\u2019s essential, vital British brio had been left as conceived in the first place, who knows what might have been achieved. Still, a slot on the bill for the 1983 Reading Festival, the day that Black Sabbath infamously headlined when fronted by Ian Gillan, did them no harm and touring with Kiss, Ozzy, and Motley Crue helped the quintet\u2019s progress.\n\nTwo years later, the Pettin\u2019 return to the studio, this time with producer Mark Dearnley (who\u2019d worked with AC/DC and Krokus). The result? \u2018Rock Ain\u2019t Dead\u2019, which surprised many with a slicker yet conversely tougher approach. The lads really had progressed, although ironically if things had gone to plan, this would have been produced by Lance Quinn, of Bon Jovi and Lita Ford fame. However, just hours before the band were due to fly to Philadelphia, to work with Quinn at his Warehouse Studios, the decision was taken by PolyGram (to whom both Heavy Pettin and Bon Jovi were signed in the US) that, instead, he should start work immediately on what was to be Jovi\u2019s second record, \u20187800 Degrees Fahrenheit\u2019.\n\nPerhaps then, it should have been obvious that record company politics were to scupper Pettin in the crucial American market. Despite continuing to show up well in the UK, once again the US was to prove elusive \u2013 through no fault of the five musicians. In many respects, this was the point when the writing was scrawled over every available wall space. Regardless of their obvious determination and grassroots support in Britain, it seemed as if Pettin\u2019s realistic chance of significant international success had gone. A third album, \u2018The Big Bang\u2019, was released by FM Revolver in 1989. Although it still proved this lot were way ahead of so many others who were selling truckloads of units and getting acclaim from the media; as the 1980s faded into memory, so too did Heavy Pettin\u2019.\n\nDriven by a desire, a passion and a capacity simply to invoke the magic and rapport the band enjoyed, they released Prodigal Songs in 2007. The album was well-received by their loyal fans and the limited pressing sold out making it a highly sought-after collector\u2019s item.\n\nIn 2017, original members Hamie, Punky, and Gordon joined by Jez Parry on bass and Michael Ivory on drums performed for the first time in 25 years at Scotland\u2019s Winter Storm. Reinvigorated, Heavy Pettin, now joined by ex-Gun guitarist Dave Aitken due to Punky hanging up his guitar and going into retirement, did several shows in 2018 including a 6 date UK tour, with 3 sold-out gigs in Nottingham, London and Edinburgh, as well as 2 sold-out headline gigs in Milton Keynes and Glasgow.\n\nThe 2019 Heavy Pettin\u2019 assault started in North Wales with HRH AOR Festival, then off to Germany\u2019s Headbangers Open Air Festival in July, and Aug/Sept tour including The Golden Age of Rock Festival Belgium, with Dee Snider and Angel, plus a mainland British tour with RockGoddess.\n\nHeavy Pettin\u2019 is currently finishing 2019 recording and mixing a new Independent EP, \u20184 Play\u2019 for mid-February fan release.on their Facebook site.\nTrack Listing :\n1.

First, DREAMERS\u2019 aesthetic embodies psychedelia. It hearkens back to simpler times on the internet, when pixilated 8-bit imagery of starry nights looked like HD. The group flaunts its self-made exploding rainbow gifs like a unicorn in heat. Second, contrary to what these psychedelic visions may musically imply, DREAMERS plays smart pop. The 12 tracks on the trio\u2019s debut LP This Album Does Not Exist sizzle and spark with three-minute tunes to perk you up and make you shake. Third, according to DREAMERS, there\u2019s a point to this. When DREAMERS\u2014Nick Wold (vocals/guitar), Nelson (bass/vocals), and Jacob Wick (drums)\u2014talk about This Album Does Not Exist, they assume a collective tone of considerate existentialism. They seek to counter the crassness of pop, the snobbery of jazz, and the pretention of indie that zaps the fun out of music with meaning. Yet, they want to draw you in, indiscriminate of taste, style, or ideology. \u201cNothing exists by itself,\u201d muses Wold. \u201cEverything in your mind is created in your mind and you see the world through that lens. Everything has a subjective reality in addition to an objective one, especially with music and art. So on this record, we\u2019re toying with that idea of existence and nonexistence.\u201d Yet, these songs of playfulness come from a place of less\u2014homelessness, joblessness, borderline hopelessness. In 2014, Wold simultaneously vacated a relationship and an apartment and began living in his Brooklyn practice space. The brick warehouse used to be a brewery, he recalls, with rats as ubiquitous as the graffiti crawling the walls. \u201cIt was just a cinderblock room with no windows, no bathrooms, \u201d begins Wold before Nelson chimes in, \u201cMusical prison!\u201d Recalls Wold, \u201cI showered with this $20 a month gym membership I had.\u201d When he returned to the studio, \u201cI just tried to make it look like I was coming in for a night session.\u201d During the two years of living in this \u201cmusical prison,\u201d Wold reduced his bartending gig to just once per week. It freed up his schedule to write more than 100 songs, many of which ended up on This Album Does Not Exist. Meanwhile, both Nelson and Wick bottomed out on the musician lifestyle and returned to office jobs in New York and Los Angeles, respectively. As Nelson says, \u201cWe found ourselves in \u2018normal\u2019 situations and quickly decided to yank ourselves out of it.\u201d So now, after bouts of vagrancy, nomadism, and vigilant attempts at normalcy, DREAMERS is now committed to its collective vision of artistry, inclusion, and idealism. \u201cThe role of the artist in society is to be the dreamer, the one who thinks ahead,\u201d considers Wold. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to pull people in. It\u2019s a way of trying to coax people into our world, continues Nelson. \u201cWe want to bring people in to listen to our music and enjoy themselves....and then hopefully it\u2019ll lead to a deeper connection.\u201d That\u2019s the dreamer MO, after all\u2014to find the joy in living and to chase it. ---- After more than two years of nomadism and cross-country touring, as well as two EPs, Los Angeles\u2019 DREAMERS released its debut full-length LP This Album Does Not Exist on August 26, 2016. The smart alt pop trio, comprised of Nick Wold (vocals/guitar), Nelson (bass/vocals), and Jacob Wick (drums), wrote much for the album in Brooklyn before moving to L.A. and tracking at Fairfax Recordings (formerly Sound City Studios). Led by singles like \u201cDrugs\u201d and \u201cSweet Disaster,\u201d DREAMERS pits the party and the paranoia of escapism in seemingly effortlessly tight, three-minute tunes. Album tracks like \u201cPain Killer\u201d and \u201cLucky Dog\u201d follow in this vein, swinging with handclaps and driving with sing-along choruses. Throughout This Album Does Not Exist, DREAMERS toys with themes of existence and existentialism, but it\u2019s easy enough to get sucked into their world and dance the big questions away. \\\\cosmic rock// \"THIS ALBUM DOES NOT EXIST\" is out NOW Download: http://smarturl.it/DreamersDoesNotExist Streaming:http://smarturl.it/DreamersDoesNotExWS", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gaura Vani Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7718034.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Acoustic, Mantra Music, World Music, Mantras, Kirtan", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "At the age of six Gaura Vani left the US to study sacred music in a gurukula or temple school in the timeless town of Vrindavan, India.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Urban Voodoo Machine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8773485.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Blues, New Orleans, Latin, Jazz, Stroll, Bop, Gypsy, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "THE URBAN VOODOO MACHINE\nOfficial Biography \u2013 March 2016\n\nWe know what you\u2019re thinking.

Don\u2019t they sometimes play jazz? Aren\u2019t half of them dead or something?\u201d\n\nSo bear with us, sunshine, cos you clearly need educating.\n\nThe story starts with Paul-Ronney Angel, a man with a double-barrelled first name. I could be a wanker about this and say the story starts with Bon Scott-era AC/DC \u2013 with Tom Waits, or the Clash, Louis Armstrong, the Pogues, the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Johnny Cash, Lionel Bart or Bertolt Brecht \u2013 but let\u2019s stick with Paul-Ronney, it\u2019s quicker.\n\nPaul-Ronney Angel ate his parents and fled the fjords of Norway with just a bottle of moonshine and several slices of decomposing fish in his back pocket. (Before he left they tried him in the Norwegian Army \u2013 he lasted a total of five hours.)\n\nAfter that, Angel washed up in London during the dying breaths of Thatcherism and took advantage of all that swinging London had to offer: he sold The Big Issue, busked Johnny Thunders & Robert Johnson numbers in Soho bus stops and played guitar for anyone who\u2019d have him.\n\nThe Urban Voodoo Machine came to him in 2002 as a fully-formed idea. He\u2019d lead a band who\u2019d play \u2018Bourbon Soaked Gypsy Blues Bop\u2019n\u2019Stroll\u2019. They\u2019d dress in black and red. There would be a LOT of them. And their music would sound like a great night out in a dangerous part of town. From the get-go, The UVM fused junkyard blues and stinging rockabilly with mariachi horns, fiddles, sinister cabaret and punk rock tangos. \u201cI wanted to play rock\u2019n\u2019roll music with a different instrumentation,\u201d says Angel, \u201ctaking inspiration from everything from delta blues, latin and gypsy music without losing the spirit and attitude of punk.\u201d His lyrics \u2013 part Lemmy, part Bob Dylan \u2013 made other (more acclaimed) songwriters sound totally. Fucking. Boring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Americana and were definitely not \u2018retro\u2019,\u201d says Angel. \u201cI write songs about living in London right now. Although having a shit time, no money, heartbreak, mental illness, addiction and suppression from the big guy is kinda universal and timeless, I guess\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah-yeah-yeah,\u201d you\u2019re thinking, \u201cbut can they cut it live?\u201d Well, there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019ve played Glastonbury, Download, Latitude, Bestival, Hard Rock Calling and toured with The Pogues and New York Dolls. With an act honed alongside the burlesque dancers, snake-charmers and fire-eaters they call friends, The UVM have become one of the greatest live acts in the country \u2013 terrifyingly bizarre, hysterically funny; a riot for the eyes and sensation for the ears: a sing-a-long, drink-a-long, clap-a-long affair.\n\nIn 2006 they launched the Gypsy Hotel Club in the then-unfashionable part of London\u2019s East End, Dalston, a monthly Bourbon Soaked Snake Charmin\u2019 Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Cabaret night for likeminded misfits, movers and shakers. Time Out Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you have 12 hours to live, spend it at Gypsy Hotel!\u201d\n\nMagazines and newspapers have lauded them for their \u201cmariachi-influenced blues, whiskey-soaked country rags and punkabilly-style rave-ups\u201d (The Washington Post) and noted that they\u2019re \u201cdrawing deep from a dirty well where Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Dick Dale are enjoying a burlesque all-nighter with Ennio Morricone\u201d (Classic Rock). They became one of the few bands that could appear on Clive Anderson\u2019s Loose Ends on BBC Radio 4 and Britain\u2019s biggest heavy metal festival Download in the same year and win at both.\n\nIn 2014, when Paul-Ronney named their third album Love, Drink & Death! he had no idea what the year had in store. In October, fiddle-player Rob Skipper died of an accidental heroin overdose, aged just 28. Guitarist Nick Marsh (formerly frontman of Flesh For Lulu) fought throat cancer throughout that year. He died in June 2015, aged 53. The Voodoo Machine transformed themselves into a New Orleans-style marching band for his funeral.

As\u00ed, de esa manera tan simple y casual, nace Shinova. Medio a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s, grab\u00e1bamos nuestro primer disco, \"Latidos\" (2009), e impulsados por aquella experiencia y con el motor de nuestra contrastada insensatez lleno de combustible, decidimos engendrar una segunda obra a la que titulamos \"La Ceremonia de la Confusi\u00f3n\" (2011).

The Edmonton, Kentucky-based rock n\u2019 roll quartet Black Stone Cherry was raised on musical forefathers such as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and the Faces, among other 1970s staples, and, now, with its sixth album, Family Tree, BSC salutes its classic rock heritage and honors its legacy with a beast of a Southern rock n\u2019 roll album.\n\n\u201cWe caught divine intervention with this one,\u201d guitarist Ben Wells says with a good chuckle. \u201cWe hit a creative spark and tapped into a spirit and a fire we hadn\u2019t before.\u201d Drummer John Fred Young adds: \u201cFamily Tree showcases all of our collective musical influences and how we have taken those to create something that is truly our own unique Southern American Rock \u2018N Roll Sound.\u201d\n\nFor 17 years, Black Stone Cherry has put forth a new vicious breed of Southern rock, injecting youthful vitality and a myriad of fresh new influences into the beloved American rock tradition. To date, the band has released five critically acclaimed albums, and one well-received blues EP. Black Stone Cherry has also rocked 12,000-cap arena shows, topped the UK charts, and shared the stage with a diverse roster of superstars, including Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, M\u00f6torhead, and ZZ Top.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry came together in 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, eventually coalescing around the lineup of Chris Robertson, vocals and guitar; Ben Wells, guitar and vocals; Jon Lawhon, bass and vocals; and John Fred Young, drums. Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Francesco Turrisi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8967072.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Jazz - World - Improvised Music", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "If a musician is defined by the company he keeps then it\u2019s little wonder that Italian pianist Francesco Turrisi skirts facile categorization.\n\nThe Turin-born, Dublin-based musician has played with former Miles Davis reedsman Dave Liebman, flamenco icon Pepe El Habichuela, kaval player Theodosii Spassov and singer extraordinaire Maria Pia de Vito. He is equally at home playing with jazz veteran Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish sean-n\u00f3s singer Roisin El Safty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata.

His four beautifully crafted solo albums and two co-led releases have garnered widespread critical acclaim.\nFor Turrisi, tradition and improvisation are not different countries but two sides of the same mountain. Turrisi\u2019s musical traditions - formal and folkloric - span the centuries and a large swathe of the history of European migration. This kaleidoscopic vocabulary - always in flux - provides the grist to Turrisi\u2019s improvisational mill and the rough material from which he crafts his uniquely original, haunting music.\nHis ability to rework ancient melodies and rhythms through a contemporary jazz prism marks him out as one of the most striking voices to have emerged on the European jazz scene in the past decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rhiannon Giddens ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9962192.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Acoustic", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I started singing at an ungodly age, standing in my crib and warbling at passing family members.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\".

Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience.

And he must follow it to the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always say \u2018you must inspire yourself, find your path, be true to it and follow it to the end\u2019 because that\u2019s really all that needs to be done in this life. If you can do that then there is nothing to worry about. Whatever your path may be, it will always teach you everything else you need to know about life on the way. For me there is a feeling of obligation to music because it is so clearly the best thing I can offer to the world, but I often fight it in favour of other things only to eventually realize I\u2019m not honouring my true path. So it becomes a balance between seemingly opposing forces that in the end put me right where I need to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe opposing force he is referring to is his commitment to a contemplative life of meditation practice. A life traditionally aided by long hours of silence and rigid structure; not a life typically lived by a working musician. After several years of torn aspiration between the life of a Buddhist monk and pursuing a serious music career as a singer/songwriter, Corey is settling somewhat into a situation he feels best serves both of these energies. He feels by maintaining a low-key, almost anonymous attitude to his live performances and online presence he can still allow room to teach guitar (another precious pastime) and spend a few hours alone each day in silent meditation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part I play gigs around here in Southern Ontario. Usually just really ordinary pubs, cafes and restaurants to people who may or may not be listening all that intently but I can show up, play my heart out and leave without having to worry too much about selling tickets, or CD\u2019s and merchandise, trying to make something happen or grow my brand or whatever. I can play covers the way I want, maybe play some originals if I feel like it, work out the kinks of my delivery and be spontaneous. I often don\u2019t even say who I am. Sometimes I don\u2019t really say anything at all. Which is exactly how I go about making my videos as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver the years, a devoted worldwide following has sprang up through his YouTube channel where he posts performances of popular and not-so-popular cover songs as well as his own material which has helped define his purpose with music. He plays many kinds of songs without pandering to any one listening demographic and often without much of anything in the way of effects or editing. Just 20 years of craftsmanship and passion on display. The response is overwhelmingly positive as viewers experience the consistent quality and creativity of each performance. Whether its the music of musical heroes or his original songs, its difficult not to be impressed by the standard at which he sets each time he plays.\n\n\n\n\u201cPutting up videos on YouTube has been such a wonderful way for me to exercise my musical freedom and play all the songs I love \u2014 from artists I admire \u2014 and challenge myself to grow as a musician publicly. It allows me to connect with people from all over the world and reminds me why its important for me to do what I\u2019m doing, because they appreciate it. I earn very little money from this medium but its been a constant motivator and mirror for me to reflect and improve which makes it such a valuable aspect of what I do. I really neglected it while I was away travelling recently, which was necessary because I was busy gigging, busking and trying to make ends meet but now that I\u2019m back home with my recording gear I\u2019m looking forward to making videos more consistently.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter spending 18 months in Australia and California doing performances mostly on the street as well as in \u201cordinary pubs and restaurants\u201d half a world away, Corey has returned to Canada and settled in Kitchener, Ontario where he performs regularly, teaches students and still finds time for silence and meditation. Always following his path.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Friday I will transport my viewers into the past where they will feel as thought they are sitting behind the recording console at Motown's Hitsville recording studio.

The stripped-down EP reimagined unexpected tracks that have taken on new political weight in the modern era (from Woody Guthrie to Mr. Rogers) and raised thousands of dollars for The International Rescue Committee's refugee aid work around the world.", "otherInfo": "Social Distance Happy Hour"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "All Time Low ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10384680.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Alternative", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Young Renegades are no more...\nReintroducing your favorite disaster, All Time Low. We took a step away for a minute- did some growing, did some soul searching, some healing... Now we're back and ready to be all yours again, our battle scars worn proudly, and our hair looking better than ever. (it's best if you just agree).\nWe've missed you all so much and we're so excited for what comes next. Feels like we've been keeping secrets from you for way too long... Been hard to keep our mouths shut, honestly.\nIt's a song and dance we've done a thousand times before, but this one feels extra-good. Besides, it's never the same dance twice.\nHope you dig this new song as much as we do...
