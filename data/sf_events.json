The band was formed as a vision of Todd Michael, a singer/songwriter from Michigan, to be a regional powerhouse and to spread their passion and joy of music to all who attend their shows.\n\nTodd Michael \u2013 Lead Vocals - the golden voice and Country front man out of the Great Lakes Bay Region of Michigan, has been nominated for Country Male Vocalist of the Year by Review Magazine in 2016 and again in 2017. Todd found a love for music very early on and has been singing since he can remember. \"My first solo performance was at 6 years old in church for Father's Day. I sang \"Love With Out End, Amen\" by George Strait. Country music is in my blood and nothing more I love than to be on stage and entertaining.\" Todd continued to grow his passion for singing at Reese High School and as he attended Saginaw Valley State University. In 2008, Todd won the Soaring Eagle Casino Idol Contest. Since then, Todd has performed with many great musicians as lead vocalist for Michigan cover bands Detroit Dixie, Kickin\u2019 Dust, and Taylor Tucky. During his musical career so far, Todd has provided direct support for National Country Artists \u2013 Brothers Osborne, Trent Harmon, Jason Michael Carroll, Parmalee, Thompson Square, Lauren Duski, Casi Joy, Eli Young Band, Jerrod Niemann, Brett Young, Ashley McBryde, David Lee Murphy, Josh Gracin, Sara Evans, Wynonna, Carly Pearce, Chase Rice, Walker Hayes, Scotty McCreery, Jon Langston, and many more.\n\nTHE TODD MICHAEL BAND:\nCharlie Coen - Lead Guitarist/Vocals - Charlie cut his teeth in a power trio playing the Detroit Rock scene. Then he hit the road playing in venues from Pontiac Silver Dome to The Rock'n'Roll Hall Of Fame, Monticello in New York, Puckett\u2019s Nashville, Florida to Las Vegas and everywhere in between. Charlie was on the bill with some of the biggest names in country music; Little Big Town, Thompson Square, Big & Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Dwight Yoakum, and the list goes on. He is bringing his national experience and his pride of being a professional musician to The Todd Michael Band.\nCharlie is also a certified luthier/Guitar builder and Owner of Coen Guitars! - Visit them at www.coenguitars.com.\n\nRob Dutcher - Guitar/Vocals - Rob is a rare \u201cjack of all trades\u201d musician and more than excels at these \u201ctrades\u201d. He is an accomplished guitar player, drummer, vocalist, songwriter, producer and engineer. He also has the convenience of a recording studio in his home and takes advantage of it whenever he can. He has showcased his talents on many recordings over the years with some of them earning airplay on local radio stations. Rob notes, \u201cI grew up on KISS, Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, and all the 70\u2019s rock and roll. If you have told me 15 years ago that I would be playing country music, I would have laughed. This new generation of country is a lot more rock than it was 10 years ago. There are a lot of great guitar players in the country music scene!\u201d Rob\u2019s guitar playing has that edge that the new generation of country demands, plus he still has that country \u201ctwang\u201d in his back pocket when he needs it. He is a great showman with great stage presence which makes him a great asset to the Todd Michael Band.\n\nBruce Shew - Bass/Vocals - Bruce is a 4th generation musician and has over 20 years of playing bass professionally. Bruce not only plays the bass extremely well, but he also has great vocal ability to sing both lead and harmnoy. Bruce has played throughout the U.S. with other bands - such as The Rock Show, Steve Armstrong and the 25 Cent Beer Band, Sinjon Smith, Taylor Tucky, and Goldie Locks before joining the Todd Michael Band.\n\nJustin Clifford - Drums - The soulful thundering drummer from Bay City, MI heads the rhythym section and keeps everyone on their feet and the band in time! Always rockin' on the \"White Tiger\" carpet, Justin brings his years of experience in the studio and on the road from his days as a member of Tweed and Dixie before joining the Todd Michael Band!\n\nPete Johnson - Acoustic Guitar/Bass/Vocals - Pete Johnson brings an exciting edge to the Todd Michael band by creating intriguing Acoustic Guitar parts, instinctive harmonies and delivering high energy performances. He plays bass, guitar, piano, and even the ukulele. Pete brings professionalism to all areas including assisting with some of the arrangements and production.\nBorn into a family of talented musicians, it is no surprise how quickly his passion for music and precision developed. He began studying piano at age 5. With growing interest this was followed by singing and playing in his church\u2019s praise band, he has also been a member of such groups as Kari Holmes, Five Rows Back and The Stand Strength Team. He started his own group, BIC, where he wrote and recorded music, played bass and sang lead. He now brings this enthusiasm, dedication and talent to the Todd Michael Band!\n\nTODD MICHAEL BAND - TEAM MEMBERS:\nAustin Brechtelsbauer - Head of Security\nDrew Hausbeck - Security\nBryce Halk - Production\nShannon Conway - Felske - Merchandise\n\nOver the last few years, collectively, members of the Todd Michael Band have been fortunate enough to have played with some of the best musicians and performers, providing direct support for National Artists such as Trent Harmon, Thompson Square, Brothers Osborne, Joe Nichols, Kentucky Head Hunters, Jason Michael Carroll, Little Jimmy Dickens, Trace Adkins, David Allan Coe, Colt Ford, Granger Smith, Lee Brice, Jon Pardi, Cole Swindell, Frankie Ballard, Jerrod Niemann, Brett Young, Ashley McBryde, Eli Young Band, David Lee Murphy, Josh Gracin, Sara Evans, Wynonna, Carly Pearce, Chase Rice, Walker Hayes, Scotty McCreery, Jon Langston, and many more.\n\nThe Todd Michael Band has become more than just a band, it's a way of life for these talented and professional musicians. \"We play music we love to perform live.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "John Allaire plays music from his albums with a feature album each show.

Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Temecula Road LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9344690.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Called out by The Huffington Post as one of the top new country acts to watch and named after the town they grew up in, Temecula Road (comprised of sisters Emma and Maddie Salute, and longtime friend Dawson Anderson) are known for their trademark harmonies and their covers which have earned praise from Carrie Underwood, Dan + Shay, and Brett Eldredge.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped.

Now at work on the follow-up to Lift Your Spirit, the L.A.-born rapper/singer/songwriter has expanded his emotional terrain to capture an even more personal element of the human experience.\n\n\u201cMy goal for this next album is to continue with the aspirational songs I\u2019ve been writing\nfor a while now, but add a dimension that\u2019s more focused on love and relationships,\u201d\nsays Blacc. \u201cMy own relationship with my family and my wife is so important to me, and I want these songs to give people the opportunity to celebrate the love in their life.\u201d\n\nOn his latest single \u201cBrooklyn in the Summer,\u201d Blacc offers an early glimpse into the\nnew direction he\u2019s taken in his thoughtfully crafted songwriting. Built on a brightly\nmelodic sound that echoes his fresh-yet- timeless sensibilities, the storytelling-driven\nbreakup ballad channels the sweet ache of nostalgia as Blacc delivers a deeply\npassionate vocal performance.\n\n\u201cSummertime in Brooklyn is electric with all kinds of energy\u2014it\u2019s this magical time that\u2019s full of music, kids running around the park, everybody hanging out in the street, the sun shining on your face,\u201d says Blacc of the song\u2019s inspiration. \u201cSo many good memories are made during those times, and there\u2019s something extra-special about all that when you think of how winter can be so brutal.\u201d\n\nSet to appear on his forthcoming album, \u201cBrooklyn in the Summer\u201d follows a pair of\nrecently released songs that show the remarkable scope of Blacc\u2019s artistry. Those\nsongs include \u201cMy Story,\u201d an acoustic-guitar- laced, Americana-tinged meditation on\nself-reliance that he penned for the MacGillivray Freeman/Brand USA film America\u2019s\nMusical Journey. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film finds Blacc tracing the\nfootsteps of Louis Armstrong from New Orleans to Chicago and beyond, crossing paths with icons like Dr. John, Jon Batiste, and Gloria and Emilio Estefan along the way.\n\n\u201cWorking on America\u2019s Musical Journey really reinforced the idea that there are no rules in music,\u201d says Blacc. \u201cIt reminded me to experiment and take risks, because those experiments can become new genres that help push our culture forward.\u201d\n\nIn a more direct manner, Blacc\u2019s experience in meeting with other artists for America\u2019s\nMusical Journey ended up altering his approach to the writing of \u201cMy Story.\u201d \u201cThere was a lyric I\u2019d initially written as the beginning of the second verse to that song: \u201cGray hairs are the ribbons/For a game of life well played,\u2019\u201d Blacc recalls. \u201cBut then when I met with Gloria Estefan, she told me how that lyric really resonated with her, so I moved it to the start of the song. That was a great moment, because the art of songwriting is the most meaningful part of this whole business for me.\u201d\n\nReleased in March, the fast-paced and fiery \u201cMake Way\u201d embodies a more urgent\nenergy, merging gospel-inspired harmonies with the commanding vocal presence\nBlacc\u2019s shown since his 2010 breakthrough hit \u201cI Need a Dollar.\u201d \u201cThat song comes from the idea that the world gets out of the way for someone who knows where they\u2019re\ngoing,\u201d explains Blacc. \u201cIt\u2019s a declaration that nothing can stop you from achieving your goals. As long as know what your direction is, the path will always be clear.\u201d\n\nAs Blacc points out, \u201cMake Way\u201d also explores a theme that\u2019s long been central to his\nsongwriting: the struggle of the underdog, and the glory that comes from triumphing\nagainst all odds. \u201cThe underdog narrative is definitely part of my upbringing,\u201d says\nBlacc. \u201cMy parents are from Panama; they\u2019re immigrants who came to this country with nothing. Even though my dad was fully educated, none of his degrees were recognized in the U.S., so he had to start all over. The idea of building completely from scratch and making something of yourself has always meant a lot to me.\u201d\n\nRaised on salsa, merengue, and cumbia, Blacc fell in love with hip-hop as a kid and\nstarted writing rap songs when he was nine. With his lyrics drawing influence from\nsocially conscious artists like KRS-One, he put out his first hip-hop mixtape at age 17.\nLater developing a fierce admiration for such soul musicians as Donny Hathaway and\nMarvin Gaye, he also discovered an affinity for folk-rock singer/songwriters during his\ncollege years. \u201cOne of the most important factors in my transition from hip-hop to being a singer was listening to people like Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Kris Kristofferson, and Cat Stevens,\u201d Blacc says. \u201cTheir songs are full of emotion that\u2019s expressed in strong lyrics, and that had a big impact on me.\u201d\n\nAfter inking a deal with indie label Stones Throw, Blacc released his solo debut Shine\nThrough in 2006 and sophomore album Good Things in 2010. Boosted by the breakout success of \u201cI Need a Dollar\u201d (which was selected as the theme song to HBO\u2019s How To Make it In America), Good Things reached gold status in countries around the world and paved the way for his signing to XIX Recordings/Interscope Records in 2012. Made in collaboration with groundbreaking producers like Pharrell Williams, Lift Your Spirit dropped on New Year\u2019s Day in 2014, debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Album.\n\nLooking back on his musical path so far, Blacc notes that landing a deal with XIX\nRecordings/Interscope prompted a major moment of reckoning, and led him to re-\nexamine his artistic intentions. \u201cWhen I signed a major-label contract, I recognized the\n\npower of having a larger audience, and I promised myself that I\u2019d use my voice for\nsocial change,\u201d he says. And in creating his upcoming album, Blacc has kept focused\non making music meant to inspire a positive shift in mindset. \u201cWhen things happening in the world seem so terrible and dark, it\u2019s so easy to get stuck in all the negative,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cBut I try to do whatever I can to help people out of that. I want my music to be the light.\u201d\n\n# # #\nwww.aloeblacc.com\n@aloeblacc", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Miles Zuniga LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Venmo: @Miles-Zuniga or PayPal.me/AlfredoZ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jagged Little Pill LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8089362.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dumes LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380187.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Alternative Indie Rock, Indie Rock, Alternative Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Join The Dumes on IG Live (@thedumes_) Every Tuesday at 5pm PST for The Record Club!

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion.

In typical David Wax Museum fashion, the songs on \"Guesthouse\" are simplistic and sophisticated, elegant and plainspoken all at once. Rather than succumbing to the weight of the newfound responsibilities that landed on their doorstep, the band has leaned into the challenges to capture a brilliant portrait of the messy beauty of it all.\n\nThe roots of David Wax Museum stretch back nearly a decade, and all the way from New England to Mexico. As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as \"pure, irresistible joy.\" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding \"like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent\") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music \"global crossover at its best\"). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, and more.\n\nIt was on the road over these past few years as the band and audiences grew, though, that Wax could feel their exuberant live show evolving beyond its formative roots.\n\n\"I felt empowered to start the band because of my time in Mexico studying folk music,\" Wax explains. \"In Boston, the term 'Americana' or 'folk' was just this catchall to describe what everyone was doing. It was helpful to use that to talk about our music at first, but we've found that our hearts feel most shaken, and the band fires on all cylinders, when we're putting on a rock show. What we've tried to retain about our folk origins is the warm sound of people playing acoustic instruments together in a room. But, by embracing more of an indie rock approach, we've colored this record with synthesizers, layers of percussion, and adventurous sonic processing. The mental shift of it helped us feel like we could do anything we wanted. There were no rules that we had to follow in terms of what was 'authentic.'\"\n\nPart of the inspiration for the shift was the presence of guitarist and producer Josh Kaufman, who sat in with the band on tour and added new sounds and textures that the they'd never experimented with before. When it came time to record \"Guesthouse,\" the band knew he had to helm it in the studio.\n\n\"The songs entered this Technicolor, 3D world with Josh,\" explains Wax. \"Aside from his contributions to the arrangements, he really wanted us all to be in a room playing the music together live so that the groove would be central. We brought in two other drummers, and there was a real focus on having as much percussion happening at the same time as possible. We gravitate towards that naturally because of the Mexican influences, all of the syncopations and 6/8 dance rhythms and the energy that that gives us, but we really embraced it this time around.\"\n\nThat emphasis on groove sucks you in from the opening seconds of the kickoff track, \"Every Time Katie,\" a whispered come-on that roils and pulses like an anxious heartbeat and features gorgeous call and response vocals from David and Suz. It's followed by \"Dark Night Of The Heart,\" which pushes the sonic envelope further than any previous David Wax Museum track, blending chamber strings, psychedelic vocal filters, explosive drums, and swirling synthesizers.\n\nWritten partially in Mexico and partially in western Massachusetts, the lyrics on \"Guesthouse\" find Wax writing with more direct, personal honesty than ever before.\n\n\"I had felt really reluctant to talk about personal stuff in the past,\" says Wax. \"I was writing personally, but there were lots of things I was obfuscating or filtering through a character to protect myself from putting too much out there. But it got to a point where it was taking a lot more energy than it was worth to maintain that privacy. When we had our daughter, Calliope, it felt like this sudden release because talking and singing about our lives was becoming more and more integral to what we were doing as artists and who we were as people.\"\n\nThe title track, which draws on several traditional Mexican songs for musical inspiration, is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the life of a traveling musician hunting for a free place to crash, while \"Lose Touch With The World\" faces down the reality of living a life far removed from that of your friends and family, and \"Young Man\" is an earnest musing on growing older.\n\n\"It's about being a parent and coming to terms with what your ambition is,\" explains Wax. \"What part of that is essential to who you are, and what part can you let go of? We have to check in with ourselves and ask what we're doing and why we're doing it more often now because we're not just us putting ourselves through the mental and physical sacrifices of touring anymore,\" he continues. \"Now Calliope is going through it with us, and Suz's dad and my cousin Jordan are going through it with us on the road. And because we're constantly checking and making sure we're doing this for the right reasons, that we feel honest in our hearts about it, I think that's brought new life to what we're doing and a new energy and a new level of commitment.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment brought beautifully to life on \"Everything Changes,\" as Wax and Slezak sing, \"Everything changes / when two becomes three.\" The song was written in response to all of the good-natured warnings about what having a child would mean for the couple, the freedom and sleep and sanity they might lose out on. Instead, they choose to focus on everything they've gained: a beautiful daughter, a stronger bond with their families and fans than ever before, and without a doubt, the most exciting album of their career. For David Wax Museum, the stakes may be higher, but that just means the rewards are even bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Carrie Welling LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7930230.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Country, Americana, Folk", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No stranger to change or the exploration that comes with it, Carrie Welling has been navigating life\u2019s twists, turns, demons, and discoveries from a young age. A self-described \u2018military brat\u2019, Welling\u2019s struggle to feel rooted in any one place carved a unharmonious path of heartbreak, doubt, and insecurity that defined her 20s and early 30s\u2026 a journey that lead to her soul-defining rebirth as an international touring artist with a place to call home in Nashville, TN.\n\nHer bold, sultry voice, reminiscent of Sheryl Crow\u2019s grit, Natalie Maines\u2019 twang, and Stevie Nicks\u2019 heart, is upstaged only by the genuine love and connection this natural performer has with her fans both on and off stage. But embracing confidence has not always been easy for this singer-songwriter, who speaks candidly about her battle to be good to herself, and to quiet the inner voice nagging her to be \u201cperfect\u201d. Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends. Some of them I talk to everyday, and they give me music ideas! They keep me going,\u201d she says, reflecting on the creator-founded platform.\n\nMelodies rich in folksy, Americana roots, paired with empowering, honest lyrics are stunningly showcased in Welling\u2019s forthcoming, full length album High Heels and Heavy Things. Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft. Meyers, FL). She\u2019ll be a featured artist at the \u201cSongwriters Island Showcase\u201d in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in 2020, and will be opening once again for Delta Rae and David Cook (Summer Tour 2020). In the interim she\u2019s logged countless hours on the road, performing at venues and house concerts across the US, as well as an international tour through Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things will be available on iTunes and Spotify worldwide in Summer of 2020.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

We wanted to do everything live so we had to get a full video crew. We had to record audio from our audio console that we currently tour with so we didn't need to do a sound check as it already sounds amazing though it might have helped if our audio tech would have been available but over all it sounded fine, 6x 4k cameras connected to a video switcher so all video and audio could be one take.

Between the house parties and the B-boy battles, Intel quickly made a name for himself across the Midwest.\n\nIntel still holds down the decks for the B-boys, but his scope and style--fueled by his limitless passion and innovation--have evolved. The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him.

King Cardinal\u2019s sophomore release, \u201cOnce A Giant\u201d, finds Mackey confidently spreading his wings from singer-songwriter into full-fledged band leader, enlisting the services of bassist Kramer Kelling, drummer Scott Roush (both of Denver mainstays Rossonian and The Raven and The Writing Desk), and pedal-steel virtuoso Jamie Mitchell, all while stretching into a sound more reminiscent of The Band or The Flying Burrito Brothers.\n\nRecorded predominantly live in Roush and Kramer's living room, and mixed and mastered by long-time Denver recording stalwarts John Macy and Randy LeRoy, \u201cOnce A Giant\u201d is a lush and nuanced six-song EP that effortlessly meanders between moments of haunting poignancy and humble triumph.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Roots LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8653218.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Roots, also known as The Legendary Roots Crew, The Square Roots and The Foundation, are an influential, Grammy winning hip hop group based out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, famed for a heavily jazzy sound and live instrumentation. Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

The project was reinvented through Rituals of Mine, and with the new moniker Lopez began writing the most honest and personal songs she had ever written. After years of obscuring her story and emotions through metaphorical lyrics, Lopez felt a sudden confidence to write more directly about her experiences as a queer woman of color. Lopez began fleshing out the songs with her long time collaborator and producer Wes Jones, who helped turn Lopez\u2019s heartfelt writing about trauma and personal growth into urgent and powerful electronic tracks. Lopez then enlisted Adam Pierce to play drums, knowing that their background in metal percussion would provide an intensity that could match her own.\n\nSince releasing their debut, Devoted, in 2016, Rituals of Mine has been praised within the indie music community, and Lopez\u2019s interactive art exhibit that simulates female-identifying people's experiences with street harassment, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, has reached over 200,000 participants.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

It was born out of tragedy after the band's guitar player, Grae McCullough, lost his one-month-old daughter to a chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18. \"The peace I had the day Lizzie's short life ended could have only been God. There was an underlying sense of peace in the devastation and the song really encapsulates the situation we were in,\" says McCoullough.\n\nBlakesley has been featured on Sirius XM, EWTN\u2019s Life on the Rock, Relevant Radio, KLOVE and has performed with wide variety of Christian artists like Matt Maher, Andrew Peterson, Jars of Clay and the Newsboys; as well as several International Papal events, most recently in Milan, Italy in 2012. He continues to tour heavily with dates booked all over the US and Canada in 2017. He partners with Compassion International as a spokesperson for releasing children from poverty in Jesus\u2019 name. He also works directly with the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Life Teen International, Catholic HeartWork Camp, Adore Ministries, as well as many churches, camps and conferences of all sizes in an effort to live out his calling and to \u201cmake disciples of all nations.\u201d (Matthew 28:18)\n\nJosh Blakesley currently lives in Houston, TX with his wife Heather and their two children, Sophie and Sutton.", "otherInfo": "REGISTER FOR THE VIRTUAL WCYR: https://arisemke.regfox.com/the-upper-room-virtual-wcyr\n\nThe Wisconsin Catholic Youth Rally was no exception to the flood of cancellations due to COVID-19.

His is a wide audience ranging from pop fans to rock, electronic and the psychedelic. In his work, he fuses micro aspects of each to form his formidable and powerful sonics.

She began her career performing in the Algerian political rock band Atakor, before leaving the country following a series of death threats. In 1999, Massi performed at the Femmes d'Algerie concert in Paris, which led to a recording contract with Island Records.\n\nMassi's music, which prominently features the acoustic guitar, displays Western musical style influences such as rock, country or the Portuguese fado, rather than traditional Algerian or Ra\u00ef musical styles performed by most Algerian musicians. Massi sings in Algerian Arabic, French, and occasionally English and Kabyle (Berber language), often employing multiple languages in the same song.\n\nMassi was born in Algiers, Algeria to a poor Muslim family of seven children. Encouraged by her older brother, she began studying music at a young age, singing and playing guitar. Growing up Massi immersed herself in American country and roots music, musical styles that would later heavily influence her songwriting. At the age of seventeen she joined a flamenco band, but quickly grew bored with the group and left.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Massi joined the Algerian political rock band Atakor, who were influenced by Western rock bands such as Led Zeppelin and U2. She recorded and performed with the group for seven years, releasing a successful album and two popular music videos. The band, however, with its political lyrics and growing popularity, became a target. Massi disguised herself by cutting her hair and dressing in male clothing, but she nevertheless became the target of a series of death threats. In 1999, she left the band and moved to Paris, France.\n\nIn 1999, Massi was invited to perform at the Femmes d'Algerie (\"Women from Algeria\") festival in Paris, which led to a recording contract with Island Records. In June of 2001, she released her solo debut album Raoui (\"Storyteller\"), which All Music Guide compared to 1960s American folk music. Sung mostly in French and Arabic, the album became a critical and commercial success in France. The following year she was nominated for \"Best Newcomer\" at the Radio 3 World Music Awards.\n\nIn 2003, she released her second album Deb (\"Heart-broken\"). The album's lyrics were more personal rather than political and it became one of the most successful North African albums worldwide. Three years later, Massi released her third album Mesk Elil (\"Honeysuckle\"). The album expanded on the themes of love and loss that had been explored on Deb and featured duets with Daby Toure and Rabah Khalfa.\n\nStudio albums\n\n* 2001: Raoui\n* 2003: Deb\n* 2006: Mesk Elil\n\nwww.souadmassi.com.fr", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Die Herren ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10378597.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Tribute Band, U2-\u00e5benbaringer", "Time": "10:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ENGLISH:\n\nU2 according to DIE HERREN\n\n\u201cMAY THIS DE HERREN CONCERT BE OUR BEST EVER!\u201d\nDIE HERREN \u2013 NOT JUST ANOTHER TRIUBUTE BAND\nDie Herren gives their audiences what they come for \u2013 each and every time.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job.

A young DJ and hip-hop / house head Sa'd \u201cThe Hourchild\u201d Ali and an even younger funk fan Chuck Da Fonk Fishman, met in the mid 1990s as touring members of George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic (P-Funk), with Sa'd himself being Dr Funkenstein's nephew.\n\nAfter a deep brainstorm to find new ways to reinvent themselves for the dance music world, Chuck and Sa'd brought Soul Clap, George Clinton and Sly Stone together for a legendary 2013 collaboration at Red Bull Studios Los Angeles. Also instrumental in that historic recording session was 8 time Grammy nominated producer G Koop. The trio - Chuck, Sa'd and G Koop then became FSQ - a production team committed to creating original funk music, across various styles (northern soul, disco, house music) with supreme quality. FSQ formed under the auspices of this P-Funk / E-Funk project.\n\nThen later in 2013, they brought on Chas Bronz, a Boston based Soul Clap acolyte and guitar hero, and One Era, a Philadelphia based multi instrumentalist and producer, to round out the FSQ team.\n\nSoul Clap launched the group in 2014 with the FSQ debut EP, \u201cZulu Congo Call\u201d which got 9/10 in Mixmag and DJ Mag. FSQ remix work for other artists can be found across a variety of labels\u200a\u2014\u200aMidnight Riot Records, ULTRA Music, Boogie Angst, Jalapeno Records, Wolf + Lamb, Bastard Jazz, BBE and many other dance music indies.\n\nSa\u2019d \u201cThe Hourchild\u201d Ali unfortunately passed away in the early summer of 2018. \u201cThe Remix Special\u201d an album compilation of unreleased FSQ remixes of their Soul Clap Records label mates was released in Sa\u2019d\u2019s honor with all proceeds going to his family.

Forthcoming on Soul Clap Records, the album features guest appearances by George Clinton & Parliament-Funkadelic, Nona Hendryx, Fonda Rae, Denise King, and Dolette McDonald.\n\nFSQ DJ sets draw upon on their extensive catalog of remix and original productions and quality dance music across a variety of styles including funk, disco, house, northern soul, and their own brand of Sly and Robbie influenced new wave, dubbed \u201cCaribbean Disco\u201d. Today FSQ members Chuck Da Fonk and Chas Bronz carry the DJ torch for Sa\u2019d Ali, who began in his career 1977 as a disco soul DJ.\n\nFSQ also performs their productions live with their rhythm section - The Supreme Qualities - aka The SQ's.", "otherInfo": "Hosted by Chuck Fishman (aka Chuck Da Fonk), Chuck draws upon his intimate knowledge of soul, funk, disco and house to present a diversity of styles and a quality DJ set of music every Wednesday from 12-2PM NYC time on The Face Radio.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "A different theme every day!

Yet the moniker is more than just a humorous takeoff on life's realities.\n\nBorn Matt the Electrician on a frosty San Francisco morn, Matt and his family soon moved to Oregon in search of culture, nice weather and vineyards. Once there, Matt spent much of his youth obsessed with Woody Guthrie, The Hollies and the soundtrack to Godspell. The Electrician's were A musical, yet thrifty family, so they found a swell garage-sale trumpet to encourage this musical interest.\n\nThe Electrician's moved back to California in the early eighties; and while the trumpet was eventually discarded, the expensive private lessons were not a complete waste, as it was here that Matt met and fell in love with the guitar.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the elder Electrician's spiraling oragami habit, money was not only extremely tight but intricately folded and beautifully hung all around the Electrician household, so Matt was limited to the only three chords his parents could afford. His dad assured him this was plenty, that kids in China only get one or two.\n\nAnd strangely, it all worked out. Matt headed to Austin, a serious music town, with aspirations of becoming a serious musician.\n\nMission accomplished. After years of a steadily-built, devoted fan base, some would say that Sever's unassuming baby-faced slacker image and \"nice guy\" blue-collar charm belie a very complex and intoxicating energy that is equal parts gritty neo-folk, frenetic boyish pulse, and tangled life experience - all held cohesive by his deft guitar skills and liquid vocals reminiscent of a young Paul Simon wrapped around a Tom Waits heart. Some wouldn't be able to say that. Some would rather type it. Others might yodel.\n\nMatt released his first CD, \"Baseball Song\", in 1998. \"Home\" in 2000, \"Made For Working\" in 2003 and \u201cLong Way Home\u201d in 2004.\n\nThe new CD, \u201cOne Thing Right\u201d, was recorded in Austin at The Aerie Studios; co-produced by Jud Newcomb, Mark Addison and Matt, and is slated for release\nin early 2007.

Like the best of the Nordic Noir leaving the Danish mainland, the recordings are at once both sonically pure and grimy; there\u2019s a shared loneliness that makes you feel that you\u2019re not at all; and all the while there is an honesty to the songwriting that tugs at your sleeve.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans.

The only thing left do was move on.\n\nAfter graduating from High School a year early, and finding that substitute teaching was not his bag, he decided to move South and go to college. Brock kissed King George goodbye and made his way to Savannah, GA for what would eventually become a turning point in his life. Brock enrolled in The Savannah College of Art and Design where he pursued and obtained a degree in video and film production as well as a minor in sound engineering. This of course is when and where Perpetual Groove was born, but that's another story.\n\nThe reluctant front man of the band has a wicked sense of humor, a passion for movies, music, video games and books about other musicians who share a passion for movies, music, video games and books about other musicians who share a passion for movies, music, video games and books about other musicians who share a passion for movies, music, video games and books about other musicians who......", "otherInfo": "Perpetual Groove frontman Brock Butler plays solo acoustic for 'Busking Down The House.'"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Royal Teeth ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8804665.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Indie.dance.pop", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Royal Teeth\u2019s new EP is called Amateurs, despite the fact that, after five years, three cities, two albums, various personnel changes, and hundreds of days on the road, the Louisiana pop quartet is definitely an ensemble of well-seasoned pros. The title is a literal etymological reading of the word: the French amateur from the Latin verb \u201cto love\u201d, applied in this case as a mission statement and a reminder of why they do what they do.\n\nIn 2011, the effervescent electronic pop of the band\u2019s debut EP, Act Naturally, attracted the attention of Dangerbird Records, which re-released both that project and its full-length follow-up, 2013\u2019s Glow. The spirited anthem \u201cWild,\u201d driven by the sparkling vocal chemistry between singers Nora Patterson and Gary Larsen, propelled the band to multiple TV, film, and video game placements, guest appearances on Last Call with Carson Daly and American Idol (at the personal invitation of fellow Louisiana native Harry Connick, Jr.) and slots at festivals, including Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo, Firefly, SXSW, CMJ, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and the Voodoo Experience.\n\nOn Amateurs, Nora Patterson\u2019s passionate lead vocals are showcased front and center, emerging from the more layered production of earlier releases. \u201cKids Conspire\u201d, the infectious lead single, buoys her up on a wave of ringing synths and propulsive, Afropop-inflected beats, as she demands, \u201ctake me all the way up, take me all the way up.\u201d It\u2019s a clear relative of \u201cWild\u201d, an anthem of possibility, but with more muscle and urgency.\n\n\u201cChildren have a wild imagination,\u201d Patterson explains. \u201cThey make up a plan for what they\u2019re going to be when they grow up. They don\u2019t hold back in terms of what they feel like they can accomplish, which is something that a lot of people lose over time.\u201d In writing the song, she wanted to channel that untamed joy, the feeling of unlimited potential and steadfast conviction. \u201cIt\u2019s about going back to when you thought you could do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to remind yourself of that.\u201d Promoting Act Naturally and Glow, Royal Teeth averaged more than 200 live dates per year, earning a glowing rep for exuberant, sweaty, high-energy live shows as explosive as their signature confetti cannons. The addition of guitarist Thomas Onebane, an inveterate, crafty tinkerer, has also led the band to take more risks in the studio. \u201cThomas was a game-changer creatively,\u201d says drummer Josh Hefner. \u201cHe\u2019s a secret weapon. We spent a little more time in the studio \u2013 more experiments, more fine-tuning. And it was more fun, with less pressure.\u201d\n\nBoth the sounds and the overarching themes on Amateurs are tougher, more mature and more surehanded than Royal Teeth\u2019s previous outings. They play like a band that\u2019s honed itself down to its core chemistry, musicians who know what they want to do and how to do it. But they also play with pure joy, ease, and love of what they\u2019re doing \u2013 like amateurs.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://bit.ly/3dUyheu"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "COLLABRO ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9357972.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Classical, Easy Listening, Musical Theatre, Soundtracks, Musicals & Popular Standards, Musicals", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Collabro are the winners of 2014 Britain's Got Talent Series 8.

Stephen Quigg is a well-established folksinger who has made a living playing music for over 40 years. Stephen grew up on the west-coast of Scotland where music played a key part in his formative years. Stephen has through all the years performed solo but for 10 years he was also part of the legendary folk group The McCalmans until they finished up in 2010. Stephen toured with the group all over Europe and it was from Denmark (Viking raids revisited) that he brought with him home his future wife and singer/songwriter Pernille.\n\nPernille grew up in a very small village in the East of Jutland, where the old folk still recall a certain songbird sitting in the neighbour's apple tree singing the Danish version of 'I'm a Rambler I'm Rover'. As a young adult she moved to Ireland following in musical footsteps and later on to Scotland where love and music combine in perfect harmony \u2013 most of the time ;-)\nThe Quiggs tour regularly with great success in Denmark, Germany and The Netherlands and of course there are many concerts on Scottish soil. Stephen and Pernille share a common feeling for the tradition of folk song, and thrive on a strong connection to the audience reaching far beyond the frontrow.\n\nThe combination of the two voices in close harmony in songs whether traditional or contemporary interspersed with anecdotes and a touch of humour has received much praise from both audiences and organisers. A concert with The Quiggs is a chance to hear folk song in its original form - simple, yet highly expressive, beautiful harmonies and songs that seek the audience's participation.\n\nThe duo has previously released the album \"River of Time\" in 2015, which received fine reviews and airplay on BBC Radio and other European radio stations.

Yet the moniker is more than just a humorous takeoff on life's realities.\n\nBorn Matt the Electrician on a frosty San Francisco morn, Matt and his family soon moved to Oregon in search of culture, nice weather and vineyards. Once there, Matt spent much of his youth obsessed with Woody Guthrie, The Hollies and the soundtrack to Godspell. The Electrician's were A musical, yet thrifty family, so they found a swell garage-sale trumpet to encourage this musical interest.\n\nThe Electrician's moved back to California in the early eighties; and while the trumpet was eventually discarded, the expensive private lessons were not a complete waste, as it was here that Matt met and fell in love with the guitar.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the elder Electrician's spiraling oragami habit, money was not only extremely tight but intricately folded and beautifully hung all around the Electrician household, so Matt was limited to the only three chords his parents could afford. His dad assured him this was plenty, that kids in China only get one or two.\n\nAnd strangely, it all worked out. Matt headed to Austin, a serious music town, with aspirations of becoming a serious musician.\n\nMission accomplished. After years of a steadily-built, devoted fan base, some would say that Sever's unassuming baby-faced slacker image and \"nice guy\" blue-collar charm belie a very complex and intoxicating energy that is equal parts gritty neo-folk, frenetic boyish pulse, and tangled life experience - all held cohesive by his deft guitar skills and liquid vocals reminiscent of a young Paul Simon wrapped around a Tom Waits heart. Some wouldn't be able to say that. Some would rather type it. Others might yodel.\n\nMatt released his first CD, \"Baseball Song\", in 1998. \"Home\" in 2000, \"Made For Working\" in 2003 and \u201cLong Way Home\u201d in 2004.\n\nThe new CD, \u201cOne Thing Right\u201d, was recorded in Austin at The Aerie Studios; co-produced by Jud Newcomb, Mark Addison and Matt, and is slated for release\nin early 2007.

Here, original songs, such as\nThis Train, Rounders, and the title track, as well as\ninnovative covers of War and Black Friday, display his\ndistinctive songwriting style, which has been described as\nacoustic Native Americana, with strong qualities of jam,\nreggae, jazz, blues, bluegrass and dance. Tim Duffy, president of Music Makers Relief Foundation, describes Morin as \u201ca brilliant guitarist, heartfelt songwriter and soulful singer whose music gives us pause to reflect on life's great rewards.\u201d\nThe release of Sing It Louder follows close on the international success Pura Fe Trio Live! A Blues Night in North Carolina, a recording from which Ole Midlife Crisis, a song he wrote and performed with Pura F\u00e9, placed at number 17 on France\u2019s iTunes blues chart in March 2011.\nCrow tribal member and son of an air force officer, Morin was born in\n1962 in Billings, Montana. He spent the bulk of his youth in Great Falls before relocating to Northern, Colorado. There, his musical career started off running with The Atoll, a band he founded in 1989 and that toured nationally, quickly gaining an enthusiastic and devoted following. With The Atoll and The Pura F\u00e9 Trio, and also as a solo artist, Morin has played celebrated venues across the globe, including Paris Jazz Festival, Winter Park Jazz Festival, Folk Alliance International, River People Festival, Shakori Hills Festival and the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Morin\u2019s performances have reached millions through national TV in Japan, France and the UK; and national radio in the US (NPR\u2019s Beale Street Caravan), UK (BBC\u2019s Whose London), France (RFI), Switzerland and Belgium.\nMorin\u2019s musical relationship with Pura F\u00e9 began during the stage show Tribe at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix. His stage credits also include co-authorship of Turtle Island, a 50-member production that played two consecutive years to sold- out audiences in Northern Colorado. With the Red Willow Dancers, Morin was a guest of the internationally renowned Kodo Drummers in Ogi japan, performing at their 1998 spring festival and other dates in Japan.\nHe has produced or appeared on over 15 recordings, and has\ntoured 22 US states, as well as Japan, France, Germany, Italy,\nSwitzerland, Spain, Belgium and the UK.\nCary Morin currently performs solo and with Young Ancients.\nFor more information, visit CaryMorin.com, and follow him on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.\nwww.CaryMorin.com", "otherInfo": "Streaming at the following links:\nhttps://youtube.com/carymorin\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CaryMorinBlues\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cary_morin"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Linda Perry ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/134330.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born on April 15, 1965, in Springfield, MA, Linda Perry spent her youth struggling with kidney disease and then addiction before focusing on music. Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pamela Mary ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10369513.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Christian Country, Country, Texas Country, Red Dirt Country, 90s Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For singer, songwriter, and musician Pamela Mary, the stage has become a second home of sorts.\nThe Houston, Texas resident has a unique sound that is mostly 90s country mixed with a little bit\nof rock and Jesus.

And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch.

When pressed for musical comparisons to her musical ability, the Oakville, Ontario-born Rayy is reluctant to provide. For as long as she\u2019s been playing music, she has been herself.

Eric Johnson is now a permanent part of The Shins, although he continues to address the musical adventure that is the Fruit Bats. Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones. In 2006, Johnson became a member of The Shins, but remains committed to the Fruit Bats. The band plans to release a fourth album sometime in the near future.", "otherInfo": "Watch Fruit Bats (https://youtu.be/R2qxOtDvQio) in their 2019 Woods Stage performance for Pickathon #AConcertADay!

The Canadian piano pop tunesmith has been steadily building a loyal following across North America and beyond for over ten years, yet his new music has the feel of an artist still out to discover something fresh and honest and connect with a wider audience.\n\nEvin On Earth builds on Evin\u2019s soulful sound and tells the story of the search for love and community. As one fan puts it, Evin has a way of \u201ccalling out all the meaningless noise we live with these days and just paring music down to simple, beautiful perfection.\u201d This new album, his sixth full-length, is one of his most diverse collection of songs, but it never strays from the consistent and distinctive sound of Evin\u2019s piano and singing. Along the way, Evin wears his various influences on his sleeve and takes us from theatrical power-pop to Afro-Latin grooves, from electro ska to laid-back beach pop. There are touches of The Who, West Side Story, Jason Mraz, ELO, Toots & The Maytals, The Bee Gees, Coldplay and Joe Jackson. Throughout the record, the catchy pop influence of his two mainstays, Billy Joel and Elton John, is alive and thriving.\n\nThe new album reunites Evin with some key collaborators from different points in his career: producer Howie Beck (Charlotte Day Wilson) first worked with Evin on 2015\u2019s Life As A Lover, bassist Jim Creeggan (Barenaked Ladies) co-produced 2005\u2019s I\u2019ll Bring The Stereo, and drummer Ian MacKay (Basia Bulat) has toured across Canada and the US with Evin.\n\nTo shake things up midway through the writing and recording process, Evin spent a summer traveling and immersing himself in two different cultures: he volunteered in the Aniishnaabe community of Manitoulin Island for a month, and he drove down to New Orleans to write for the other month. These adventures added a thematic thread to some of the album\u2019s songs. Evin\u2019s no stranger to dropping himself in the middle of unfamiliar territory. In the summer of 2012, he spent two months studying percussion in Cuba in the midst of a rich Afro-Cuban community.\n\nEvin On Earth was recorded in Evin\u2019s homebase of Toronto, and the album title has been kicking around since his early years coming up in the Montreal scene. A friend suggested it back then, and Evin originally scoffed at it - but it just seemed right for this album. That same friend challenged Evin to write a short album opening title song, and the result is \u201cEvin On Earth\u201d, a kind of mission statement and salute to artists everywhere.\n\nEvin\u2019s fans include Canadian icons Barenaked Ladies and Ron Sexsmith. CBC Music called Evin the \u201cnext big thing\u201d, and \u201cHave I Ever Loved?\u201d was among the Top 20 most played songs of 2015 on Sirius XM\u2019s CBC Sonica. \u201cAl Green\u201d reached #1 on Sirius XM\u2019s The Verge. In 2017, Barenaked Ladies brought him out to support their US theatre tour, and he\u2019s also shared stages with Sexsmith, Dan Mangan and Sarah Harmer. Audiences love the spontaneity, intimacy and energy of his live shows.\n\nThe Evin On Earth album title took on added nuance when toward the end of making the record Evin had a near-death experience. He and a friend found themselves lost in the woods of Quebec after-dark while cross-country skiing in -25 degree celcius weather. Close to hypothermia, Evin almost lay down to rest in the snow, but he pushed on. During the next two months, he endured frostbite on his finger-tips and was unable to play piano.\n\nMike Evin\u2019s modern spin on piano pop manages to sound contemporary, classic and elusive all at once. His voice is a heartfelt reflection of the human experience. Now with his new album (out October 11 on Cairomin Records), he\u2019s bringing everyone another \u2018little slice of Evin on Earth.\u2019\n\n\u201cAn overflowing musical universe\u201d\n- Live In Limbo\n\n\u201cDanceable sexy pop music that will make you want to sway your hips\u201d\n- The Girl At The Rock Show\n\n\u201cHauntingly beautiful vocals and mesmerizing music\u201d\n- Canadian Beats", "otherInfo": "Music Room Session"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "the Lawrence Peters Outfit ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351367.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Ameripolitan, Traditional Country, Country, Honky Tonk", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Lawrence Peters Outfit play un-ruined country music, a term Lawrence coined to describe the band\u2019s original, deep-rooted, honky tonk sound.

In a few short years, he had quickly become one of Portland's most well-loved, consommate road-warriors, cherished by fans of songcraft, other songwriters, and the bandleaders who, over and over, invited him to join them on tour. Still a young man, he'd released three LPs, numerous splits, 7\"s EPs, and singles under the moniker Hip Hatchet and toured as a multi-instrumentalist for the likes of Esme Patterson, The War & Treaty, Quiet Life, and others. He relocated to Nashville in 2017 to continue working as a touring musician. But the endless cycle of barely-occupied sublet apartments, ephemeral friendships, and might-have-beens left him drained, burnt out, longing for some semblance of stability or a connection that remained always tantalizingly out of reach.\n\n\"I keep telling myself this is the life that I chose,\" he sings on album\u2019s title track Me and the Moon, a reflection on the solitutde of traveling alone. Me and the Moon holds, at its core, a fundamental question - if you devote your life to labor, what is left to go home to?\n\nIt's a tender, restrained record, distilling and developing his previous work with a confident stylistic voice; his vocal naked and close, the arrangements uncluttered and deliberate - a brushstroke of pedal-steel crying in the left ear, a faint swell of a synthesizer somewhere through a highway tunnel, the deft chiming of fingerpicked guitar melodies. The writing is unhurried and poignant, each story linked by a wistful kindness - for both the author and the characters that drift in and out of his life. As weary as Philippe clearly is by the end of side B, he never comes across as bitter, rather, he delivers his words with an obvious empathy that is much better felt than described.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Guitar Mash ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9837672.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "To contribute what we can for collective sanity and joy, Guitar Mash is thrilled to announce #HomeMadeMusic, a series of Virtual Campfires.

Though the song references the mythical sirens of the sea, I loved the idea of a double meaning: an actual siren, warning call, alarm! The songs on this record were written over a span of 10 years. These songs have been my comfort and my therapy, as I\u2019ve journeyed this world, witnessed injustices, engrossed myself in my ancestral culture, grown within myself, literally travelled the globe, loved, lost, failed, loved again, and struggled to reach the place where I am today.

The album announces Regen as a formidable talent with the rarest of gifts - an original voice that speaks to the human condition with authority and hope. Regen\u2019s songs define our times, but are meant to last for all time.\n\nRegen knows a thing or two about navigating the unexpected. Coming of age in the 1980s, he nourished himself on a steady diet of MTV and synth pop. And while he could have spent his life in search of New Wave glory, he instead moved to New York City and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of jazz piano great Kenny Barron, toured with artists like Little Jimmy Scott and Kyle Eastwood, and slowly carved-out a name for himself as a solo artist who defied easy categorization.\n\nLike Bruce Hornsby before him, Regen creates infectious melodies that often belie the music\u2019s harmonic sophistication. Like Randy Newman, he draws on the richness of the American musical vernacular, distilling an ocean into a creek the artist can call his own. It\u2019s on the axis of those seemingly diverse worlds that Jon Regen\u2019s sound is born. It's also on the axis of differing worlds that Higher Ground sprang to life.\n\nHaving experienced a new level of artistic success following his critically-acclaimed 2015 album Stop Time (produced by Mitchell Froom and featuring members of Elvis Costello\u2019s Imposters), Regen wasn\u2019t eager to rush into the studio for a follow-up. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going to make a record of just any songs, produced just any way,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI never gave up the idea of recording again, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to make the same album I did last time. I wanted to be inspired.\u201d\n\nParenthood helped Regen meditate on several factors. \u201cI wondered if, in this new divided world \u2013 and in this era of instant internet fame, if music still resonated the way I remembered it could.\u201d\n\nWith no stream of roadwork planned (he was too busy being a full-time dad), Regen played local shows around New York City and dug into his work as the Editor of Keyboard Magazine. \u201cFor the first time in decades, I had a regular jazz gig,\u201d he says. \u201cI became reacquainted with the piano in a way I hadn\u2019t been able to while I was constantly touring. I also threw myself into my writing work, relishing the chance to explore the inspiration behind otherpeople\u2019s music.\u201d Then in September 2018, Jamiroquai\u2019s Matt Johnson invited Regen to the group\u2019s gig at the Forest Hills Tennis Center in Queens, New York.\n\nThe location proved remarkable: Regen\u2019s parents had lived on the same street during the 1960s. Possibly more remarkable was the gig itself: \u201cI saw 14,000 people dancing to funk music in the New York rain that night, and my faith in the healing power of music was instantly restored.\u201d\n\nWhen Regen and Johnson met at the afterparty, they hit it off instantly, despite being something of an unlikely pairing. \u201cMatt\u2019s a proper British synth whiz, and I\u2019m a gravely-voiced New York singer/songwriter. But I thought, \u2018Maybe there\u2019s something to this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair wrote the song \u201cWide Awake\u201d as a way of testing the waters - with Johnson in London and Regen at home in New York City. And despite the distance, the duo struck creative magic. \u201cIt was just this great marriage of Matt\u2019s studio wizardry and my songwriting and piano styles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cFunnily enough, that song would never have been born had I not bought an old Roland Juno-60 synthesizer and started fooling around with it on top of my Steinway grand piano. But once I did, I knew I was onto something fresh. It was a sound that was new to me, so I chased it.\u201d\n\nJohnson says, \u201cWhen he sent me his idea, I was struck by the rich quality of his voice. As the track progressed, I learned that Jon could also play great jazz piano. For me, this album shows off all the best in Jon - great songs, great piano and a truly distinctive voice.\u201d\n\nBut a lingering question remained: Could the duo record an entire album without anyone ever playing in the same place at the same time? They were about to find out.\n\nFor Regen, making the album became a mission unto itself, regardless of the challenges the pair faced. \u201cI wrote lyrics while my son watched \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 and recorded piano and vocals in my apartment while he napped,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore we knew it, the project was materializing before our eyes.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to formidable companions, Regen enlisted an all-star cast that reads like the lineup of a supergroup; keyboardists Benmont Tench, Chuck Leavell, Ricky Peterson (David Sanborn, Fleetwood Mac) and Matt Rollings (Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson,) signed-on, as did Duran Duran\u2019s Nick Rhodes.\n\n\u201cFor someone who used to air drum to Rio as a kid, hearing Nick\u2019s synth work on my music was positively surreal,\u201d Regen says. \u201cIn a lot of ways, this record is about the moment when your heroes become your peers.\u201d\n\nTench says that there was never a second thought about lending his talents to the album. \u201cNot only is Jon an annoyingly great piano player,\u201d the veteran keyboardist says, \u201che isn\u2019t sitting still in the songwriting department, either: this is a laudable leap forward in both style and expression.\u201d\n\nHaving scored a premiere rhythm section for his previous album, Regen was once again drawn to top players like bassists Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell) and Tim Lefebvre (David Bowie, Tedeschi Trucks Band), and drummers Keith Carlock (Steely Dan) and Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel). Previous Regen collaborators like guitarists Andy Summers (The Police) and George Marinelli (Bonnie Raitt) return here, as do cellist Julia Kent and Swiss harmonica ace Gr\u00e9goire Maret. And as impressive as the guest list on Higher Ground is, what\u2019s even more miraculous is that every musician played his or her parts in their respective hometowns. The entire album was recorded remotely, across different cities, oceans and countries.\n\nListening to Higher Ground, it\u2019s not hard to imagine what led musical luminaries to join in. The album strikes the perfect balance between gravity and levity, between deep introspection and knowing when to cast worries aside and get down to celebrating the moment.\n\nThe album opener \u201cWide Awake\u201d gives us a glimpse of the myriad of styles Regen pulls from. Funky, R&B grooves collide with jazz and pop flourishes, and lyrics that never overstate the tune\u2019s status as a love song. And the title track \u201cHigher Ground\u201d sounds like something culled from an earlier time and, perhaps, like John Hiatt\u2019s \u201cHave a Little Faith\u201d not just a song but a hymn to the heart. \u201cThat one is for my son,\u201d Regen remarks. \u201cThe lyric, \u2018I\u2019m a better man now, \u2018cause I stand on higher ground\u2019 is about him showing me what\u2019s really important in this world. The title became a mantra for the entire album, pushing me to elevate my singing, songwriting and piano playing at every turn.\u201d\n\nAs good as he is at walking in the alleyways of America\u2019s musical past, Regen moves himself into the contemporary via the socially-conscious \u201cWho Cares If Everybody Else Knows.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lyric that all right-minded people can relate to,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cand I feel it\u2019s where I took Jon furthest from his comfort zone musically. The track sounds completely modern and Nick put in some really interesting sounds at the end to finish it off.\u201d\n\nOn other tracks, Regen\u2019s piano mastery is firmly on display. \u201cHole in My Heart\u201d features a dreamy, triple-tracked piano solo that channels the best of early Bowie and later Hornsby. The libidinous, New Orleans-inflected \u201cEvery Night\u201d recalls Dr. John at his swampiest. And \u201cEast Side Blues\u201d pits Regen\u2019s blues-drenched piano against the street noise of his native New York City, marrying humor with high musical art.\n\nOne song, \u201cThe Last to Go,\u201d bridges Regen\u2019s recent past with the music of his youth. \u201cBenmont played on that one and recorded the organ at Mitchell Froom\u2019s studio in Los Angeles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cMitchell produced my last album, Stop Time, and played the first organ solo I ever heard, on Crowded House\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over.\u2019 And so the circle completes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Last to Go\u201d not only summarizes many of the album\u2019s themes, it\u2019s also unquestionably a new high in Regen\u2019s compositional output. \u201cIt was the last song I wrote for the album,\u201d he says. \u201cI was up late in New York City one night, thinking about the album and my approaching birthday \u2013 of where I have been, and where I still hope to go. I traced my life back through big events, and more personal earthquakes. And of course, with the world we live in now full of disinformation and vitriol, we all look for a guiding light. My wife is that for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I wrote that song, I called Benmont to play organ on it. Because nobody can move air on a Hammond like Ben. He also had his daughter on the exact same day I had my son, and I had a feeling he feels about his wife the way I do about mine.\u201d\n\nThe balance between light and dark heard on the album is not lost on Regen. \u201cLooking back at the album now, I see it\u2019s full of both optimism and fear,\u201d he says. \u201cSongs like \u2018Wide Awake\u2019 and \u2018Higher Ground\u2019 speak to the power of love and family and the happiness they bring. But songs like \u2018Who Cares If Everybody Else Knows\u2019 and \u2018Before\u2019 are darker. They are me grappling with the madness of life as a new parent in 2019 \u2013 where no one seems to stand for anything besides greed and power. Those are tough sentiments to reconcile. In the end, I suppose life is about just that \u2013 how to explain the unexplainable.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bethany Cosentino ( Best Coast ) ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Grenon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10363323.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "GRENON is an alt-rock band from New Hampshire (USA).

My granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy was born in Caswell County in 1795. Maybe we go back further, I don't know.\n\nOn Friday the 13th, November 1970, I was born at the Cape Fear Valley Hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, probably the biggest military town in the country. Fort Bragg alone covers 250 square miles, and the used car dealerships and titty bars are like stars in the sky, grains of sand on the beach. The ground is sandy and the woods are open and piney, with tall loblollies, jack oaks, and the longleaf pine.\n\nWe left for Fort Worth, Texas when I was about 2 or 3, so that dad could attend Southwest Theological Seminary. My first memory is of crossing the Mississppi in a U-Haul. My dad was excited about the bridge and couldn't stop talking about how it was an engineering marvel and all.\n\nFrom there, the memories get thicker, catching tarantulas after a rainstorm, putting pennies on the railroad track, barefoot ooching across the Texas road, so hot the asphalt was soft. There was a snowstorm. We've got pictures.\n\nDad got a commision to preach in an English-speaking church in what was then West Germany, in a little town called Vernheim. Our landlord worked for Mercedes, got a new one every year, and kept a weinkellar like a liquor store. Dad would give me the rent check, I'd walk it upstairs, and the hausfrau would pinch my cheeks and give me a chocolate bar as big as my head.\n\nIn church, my father preached and my mother played piano for the services. I learned how to sing in that church and even did a solo of \"Amazing Grace\" for the congregation. We had a piano in the house and my mom gave me some lessons. I did really well, but I got bored with the workbook/lesson plan style. My brother had a guitar and that was cooler. We moved to Giessen a few years later and he got \"The Wall\" for a birthday present from a friend. Mom and Dad almost didn't let him keep it, 'cause there were \"disturbing images\" on the inside. They relented and Gray taught me my first guitar piece, that cool acoustic guitar solo in A minor. I was 8.\n\nWhen I was about ten, we came back to the states, my daddy lost his mind, divorced my mom, and started drinking and managing Eckerds drug stores. He went through another wife and found the construction industry, wherein he could stay drunk all day. That finally lead him to recovery and he spent the rest of his life building houses for storm victims and Habitat whenever he could. He was a good man with a lot of demons, and he married a third time 'til death did he part in 1999. His favorite song was \"Amazing Grace\" and his vinyl bluegrass collection influenced me greatly, especially Flatt and Scruggs and the Stanley Brothers. He bought a banjo once and became so frustrated with it that he turned it into a clock.\n\nMom was a rock through all of that, got a good job at UNC, paid a man to build her a log cabin in the country outside of Chapel Hill, and did her best to raise me. I was a real pain in the ass. Once I got my own guitar, I had a place to put all my teen angst, but it didn't help my schoolwork at all. I probably set records for non-attendance and spent a lot of time running around in the deep woods of western Orange County. Four years in the high school jazz big band program taught me the majority of what I still know about music theory. Along with an early enlistment in the Navy, music got me through and out into the real world, where I finally got my ass kicked.\n\nI spent the next four years touring the Mediterranean on a tank landing ship out of Little Creek Naval Base in Norfolk, VA. The open ocean is a powerful thing to behold. The stars at night are unlike anything you will see on this Earth anymore; it is the last great wilderness. Besides that, being tear-gassed was about the most fun I ever had in the Navy. I carried a guitar behind my bunk everywhere we went and made strange four-track recordings when we were in port and there was an empty berthing to use as a late-night studio. Of all the guys I knew on ship, I still remember the names of the ones I played music with- Robert Thomas, David Saylor, Hadji Henderson.\n\nAfter my time was up, I spent some days in Virgina Beach, playing in a heavy rock band called Coup d'Etat at first, and then Day 11, which was just a license plate we saw at a grocery store one day. We were sort of prog, like Bad Brains meets King Crimson and we rubbed Tiger Balm on our nads before we took the stage because Fishbone said that they did. They probably said that just to see if anyone would do it. A girlfriend gave me my first acoustic guitar, a Fender; I think she stole it. She stole enough money from me that I think I paid her for it.\n\nVirginia Beach outright sucked, so I came home to work at Weaver Street Market and started another band called Scalliwag. I knew there was something missing from my culinary life (mac'n'cheese, ramen, pizza) and the job at Weaver Street was a cry for help. It turned out to be the social hub of Carrboro, NC and I met a lot of people who are still my close friends today. The rock band thing wasn't working out, so I started playing the acoustic more and met a lot of other acoustic musicians.\n\nMy friends Leo Lorenzoni and Michael Kovich told me about an Old-time fiddler's convention up in Buena Vista, VA and it sounded like just a laid-back, weekend-long party. I cruised up there and hung out with them; I can't even remember if I had a tent. It changed my life and it changed my music, just banging away on an A chord for hours at a time and sippin' that corn liquor. I didn't know the songs and I didn't care. Whatever these people had a hold of, I wanted some of it. It shot straight down into my veins like lightning and made my hair stand up on end. The music was intense, lyrically cut down to the bone, no bullshit. They didn't have bridges; bridges were for pussies. People got killed, died or fell in love and then got killed or maybe drank themselves to death. They weren't gonna be treated this way and they'd trade their shoes for a little bottle of booze. They were big, like John Henry and Wild Bill Jones, all fists and whiskey, heartbroken and angry as I was, ready to kill somebody.\n\nI started going to Clifftop and Mt. Airy and finding Old-time jams at home and on the road, anywhere my new friends lived. I got to thinking that I could write songs like that, or maybe one just fell out of me and I thought, \"Wow, there it is.\" Either way, I figured nobody was writing songs like that anymore, at least nobody I'd heard, and I knew that style was just technique. In other words, those songs didn't sound old because they were old; they sounded old because they were written in an old style. There wasn't a reason in the world why somebody couldn't write a song like that, if he wanted to.\n\n\"Ashe County Fair\" was probably the first song I wrote like that. Another one was \"Velma,\" a song I wrote about the woman who killed my grandfather. I think somebody dies in most of the songs on my first album. Three of them die in \"Velma.\" I was also playing Irish music by the time I recorded, so I played the guitar parts in an alternate tuning, DADGAD. In retrospect, it gives the whole album a dark, open sound that takes the themes over the edge and out into the dripping woods.\n\nI started touring full-time in 2000, realizing that I could do it as a solo performer and actually make a living. Of course, that's what every other singer/songwriter in America was doing, too, but I didn't even know what a singer/songwriter was, so that didn't bother me. I thought I was a folk musician. Over time, I realized that folk got cross-dressed and don't mean what it used to mean anymore. I think my friend Aengus Finnan said it better than anybody I've heard yet, \"It's a style of presentation.\" So that's just it, as long as you don't put on the razzle-dazzle and shake your ass in a sequin skirt, you can be a folk musician. Sit there on a stool and play your tuba, tell a story once in a while and wear some Birckenstocks. Everybody will think you're a folk musician.\n\nIn 2002, I went to the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas, where there are lots of these folk musicians, only mostly songwriters. I wandered around for a week looking for the dance tent and the fiddle bands before I realized what I've already said about the word \"folk.\" It ended up being an amazing and inspiring experience and I've been for all 18 days every year since. At the 2003 festival, I won the New Folk competition and got hired on as a performer for the next three years. I never took to Birckenstocks and my friend Anais Mitchell helped me find a great pair of boots in Austin. They're Fryes.\n\nIn 2004, Dromedary and I recorded an album together called \"The Sea and the Sky,\" which brings beautiful instruments from all over the world into my sound and songwriting. I've toured in Europe and the US with them, including a return to Kerrville and two consecutive years at the Moab Folk Festival in gorgeous Moab, Utah. If you're not familiar with Dromedary, I highly recommend you go to dromedarymusic.com right now- well, after you read the rest of this, anyway. Their music is magic, like the voice of Emmylou Harris, an instant drop in the shoulders, a glaze on the eyes, a trip back to childhood. I'm honored to be friends with them and occasionally share the three-man funk in a rental car.\n\nThe next album was a rock 'n' roll album called \"This Is The New That.\" Rock 'n' roll, because I just didn't know how else to play these songs. They're rock 'n' roll songs. It leads off with a revision of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" Dromedary came back into the studio with me and played electric guitars. Rock 'n' Roll Hall-of-Famer and Muscle Shoals session guitarist Will McFarlane sits in on a few. It was amazing to watch him work, a blue-eyed gent in a kilt ripping the blues from stem to stern. When the first take was done, there were no questions and nothing left to be done but get the cat off the ceiling. What a pro.\n\nWill McFarlane told me a story about recording with Frank Sinatra, wherein Frank walked in and sang the whole album, no retakes. The engineer asked him to sing the first few words of the first song again, because he hadn't had time for a line check. Apparently, Ol' Blue Eyes squared his shoulders and told the engineer, \"Overdubbing's for faggots,\" and walked out. Political incorrectness aside, I rather like his style.\n\nTexas is a huge influence on my writing. \"The Law and the Lonesome\" is what might have happened if Townes Van Zandt had made a record with Doc Watson. Tamara Kater of Canada's venerable folk mag Penguin Eggs called \"The Law and the Lonesome\" her \"album of the decade.\" Co-produced by the brilliant Chris Bartos in Toronto, \"The Law and the Lonesome\" features a couple of co-writes with my friend Corin Raymond. We wrote the title track together, which was featured in a songwriting class at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nI beat \"Radio Soul\" and recorded \"Cackalack\" in six hours with a handful of the best musicians in Toronto, although it sounds like it was recorded in a barn in North Carolina. Ken Whitely, who has gold and platinum records to his name, engineered the record in his converted garage with Nik Tjelios. As of mid-January 2011, \"Cackalack\" was #1 on Roots Music Reports folk radio chart. I went back to Canada and made a record in two days in Gimli, Manitoba with Alexa Dirks of Begonia and Andrina Turenne singing harmonies. Joanna Miller, Rej Ricard, and Grant Siemens round out the all-star Winnipeg crew.\n\nJonathan Byrd & The Pickup Cowboys is my latest record and project. We play every Wednesday at a little roadhouse called The Kraken on highway 54 outside Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The residency has become a community for some and a pilgrimage for others. Tune in on facebook live, 7-10pm Eastern Time any Wednesday, or make the trip to join us.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

But tucked into the coves, bluffs and hollers above the freeways are hairpin roads, dirt paths, hidden waterfalls and stunning valley views. Mountain native Jennifer Daniels claims this territory as her own, despite traversing the interstates to make a living. As she puts it, \u201cI sometimes think of my songs as vertical.\u201d\nFor 10 years now, the singer/songwriter has chosen a narrow, winding, mountain road less traveled than the broad highway frequented by homogenized pop superstars, cluttering the radio with disposable hooks and disingenuous, secondhand sentiment. For her, \u201cpart of the music is figuring life out. I can\u2019t help but feel I have some Bohemian blood in me, searching for truth and beauty and love. You can\u2019t serve the master of fame and fortune and the master of truth and beauty\u2014no path exists for following both.\u201d\n\nAlongside husband Jeff Neal, who contributes tasteful guitar and mandolin support, Daniels first caught the attention of music fans in live settings\u2014beginning in 1999\u2014with her supple, dynamic voice and physical, absorbing delivery. It began in time-honored, grassroots fashion, with gigs in Chattanooga, Tennessee\u2014just down the mountain from home\u2014then short forays around the southeastern U.S. and then regular hauls up and down the East Coast and, finally, jaunts across the country, with as many as 200 dates each year.\nOn the road for long stretches, Daniels made Decatur, Ga\u2019s legendary Eddie\u2019s Attic\u2014an acoustic-music listening room known for launching the careers of everyone from the Indigo Girls to Shawn Mullins\u2014her home away from home. During this period Daniels was a regular contestant at the venue\u2019s \u201cOpen Mic Shoot-Out\u201d contests. On one particular night, she made it to the final, but fell just short of the top prize, edged out by a young upstart named John Mayer. Daniels won the contest later, topping another notable singer/songwriter, Zac Brown (whose Zac Brown Band now is blowing the doors off country radio) to do it.\nHer stage reputation established, Daniels began establishing herself as a recording artist, independently releasing her 2000 debut, Fists of Flood, to raves in Performing Songwriter, which named it a Top 12 DIY Release for the year and said, \u201cThis is music that seems to have grown slowly from some rich, dark soil.\u201d\nDespite the occasional conversation with label execs, Daniels has chosen to remain independent, drawing upon her own resources for touring and recording. For Daniels and Neal, a sustainable, fulfilling life creating meaningful music and connecting personally with listeners holds far more reward than chart positions, heavy-rotation singles or SoundScan numbers.\n\nNow, four studio albums and one live album later, Daniels has recorded her most ambitious effort, Come Undone, a song cycle in three acts. The album\u2019s recording was fraught with more than just artistic significance, with Daniels and Neal spending sessions in wonder and anticipation at the pending birth of twins, their first children (if you don\u2019t count songs and beloved dog Bob Marley). As Daniels notes, rather than heavy literature, \u201cduring tracking I was obsessively reading What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting!\u201d\nSignificantly, for an artist who began her recording career with stripped-down arrangements\u2014featuring guitars, mandolin, a little bass and not much else\u2014on Come Undone producer Scott Smith goes for a fuller approach, with strings, electronics, a choir and a pipe organ at various moments, depending on what seemed appropriate.\n\u201cThere was a whole new level of artistry, so we felt the production\u2019s depth should fit the project,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe orchestration and sonic choices were a natural fit not only for the songs, but for framing Jennifer's voice in a way it hasn\u2019t yet been heard. The complexity of her voice\u2014both lyrically and melodically \u2014works amazingly well stripped down, with two guitars. So the challenge was to add to this while still retaining the intimacy of her message. There's plenty of ear candy for anyone who wants to listen for it, yet those in love with Jen\u2019s voice and the songs won't be distracted.\u201d\nJust as ambitious as the sounds\u2014and owing, in no small part, to the significant life-changes afoot\u2014are the themes, both epic in scope and more personal than ever. To name one example, few artists this side of Bono would have the guts to tackle an argument with God in song, but in \u201cYou Slay Me,\u201d Daniels pulls it off. \u201cThat song practically wrote itself,\u201d she observes, \u201cduring a night when I was grief stricken, angry and exhausted by months of sorrow, unable to understand why God would allow such heartache. Honestly, I\u2019m afraid to perform it\u2014it\u2019s personal, it\u2019s revealing and it leaves me vulnerable to misinterpretation and judgment.\u201d\nAt the same time, she says, that song and one other close-to-the-bone confession, \u201cEvery Single Day,\u201d are absolutely indispensable to the story Come Undone tells, one of hopes and dreams, then disillusion and darkness and, finally, joy that survives all the more for having been tested and scarred by life. \u201cThe title is an invitation to allow the weight of disappointment to strip you of things that can be taken away in order to find the stabilizing force of what cannot,\u201d Daniels concludes.\nThat said, even Daniels\u2019 most serious album to date doesn\u2019t forsake her well-known humor, particularly on \u201cYou Should Love Me,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek strut before a would-be beau. It\u2019s a side of her that shows up even more forcefully onstage. \u201cIf the audience laughs at my jokes, I\u2019m liable to try a whole stand-up routine,\u201d she notes. \u201cThen Jeff will quietly remind me that we\u2019re here to play music and we all laugh some more.\u201d\n\nWith a new album in hand and new twins to raise, Daniels and Neal still will be making their way down from their home sweet mountain home to hit the roaring interstates and play to their loyal audience. \u201cQuite honestly, we\u2019re not sure how it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Daniels admits. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never been sure how it would work, even in the earliest days when it was just the two of us, or when we got our now-five-year-old puppy.\u201d\nLong after the highways need to be rebuilt, and all the fast-food drive-throughs dotting their exits have been boarded up, ancient Lookout Mountain will still tower over the landscape. In the same way, Daniels hopes to keep writing, playing and recording long after today\u2019s chart-toppers have been relegated to the \u201cwhere are they now?\u201d file.\n\u201cWe saw Gordon Lightfoot play last year,\u201d Daniels recalls, \u201cand came away thinking how awesome it would be to be able to continue writing and performing well into old age. The audience didn\u2019t care that his voice wasn\u2019t what it used to be. They loved the stories and they loved the storyteller.

My father who was a fine art painter and an architect would sit me on his lap and play name that tune with many classical pieces of music! Watching him paint and listening to classical music and opera as well as many other types of music was what my childhood was rich with.\n\nSoon enough I was also drawing, painting and playing music. I was especially into poetry, lyrics and songwriting having been exposed to this in early education by a teacher who was particularly fond of folk music. Simon and Garfunkel, Cohen, Dylan - we studied these amazing writers in our English classes. I adored writing poetry and this inevitably led to songwriting and learning my chosen instrument, the piano. I had a love affair with anything that included piano. I was influenced by the classical masters as well as early Elton John, Billy Joel, The Beatles - all kinds of music. Motown was also a big influence as well as classic and traditional Spanish music that my Mom would sing around the house. I had a rich tapestry of influences to drawn on and learn from.\n\nMy love affair with drawing and painting was also very strong, eventually leading me to study art at The Alberta College of Art in Calgary. I became a very successful award winning illustrator working on many important campaigns over the years and illustrating with Rick Jacobson, 17 children's books and many book covers, three of these books ( the most recent) authored by us as well as illustrated.\n\nIt wasn't until 6 years ago that the music career I had put aside rose to the surface with a vengeance and I began to once again write and perform all over Toronto. I recorded my first CD, The Other Side, in 2003 and this led to an invitation to the New York International Independent Music Festival where my band was awarded Best Soft Rock Band (there were over 600 bands in the event). More performances in New York and in various festivals followed. I am deeply entrenched in my musical adventure, a lifelong dream! I am thrilled to have the opportunity to follow my deepest desires in this life.

Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating. But now everyone's going through something. And as difficult as that is, there's comfort in that too. Because we're all in it together, and we have been the whole time. Except now we can actually feel it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jaimee Harris ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365139.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Americana, Folk-rock, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jaimee Harris is poised to become the next queen of Americana-Folk, a slightly edgier Emmylou Harris for the younger generation.\n\nHer new album draws comparisons to Patty Griffin, Ryan Adams, and Kathleen Edwards \u2013 all writers who know how to craft a heartbreakingly beautiful song with just enough grit to keep you enthralled. Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Will Dailey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7763884.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Roots & Blues, Rock And Roll, Singer Songwriter...

You will hear him talk about \u201cstaying constant,\u201d being \u201creal\u201d and \u201cnatural.\u201d They resonate in the songs he writes, those he chooses to record and in every aspect of his career.\nIt isn\u2019t that Tom Wurth does not embrace change and growth. He has experienced a lot of that musically as he met milestone after milestone in his career. At the same time though, he believes that music can be a \u201cconstant\u201d for most people and they crave consistency from an artist.\nWhether you sit down to talk about his career, where he has been, where he is going; or listen to the lyrics of each song, you will know his commitment to that real and natural music. It is music you can count on with every song and at every show.\nThe new album A Different Soul shows that commitment. There are deep roots that brace this album. Roots from his small town up-bringing to his musical roots that are evident with the collaborations found on this new project which includes Vince Gill, T. Graham Brown and John Ford Coley.\nOut of the gate, at only twenty years of age, Tom Wurth was nominated for a Grammy. That particular milestone built a foundation for his career. The Grammy experience fresh in his mind, Wurth pushed forward with his songwriting aspirations.\nWurth initially signed as a staff writer with Belden; later signing with one of the largest publishers in the world, BMG Music Publishing. At BMG he garnered two major record label cuts including; \u201cIf the Road Runs Out,\u201d appearing on This is Ty Herndon \u2013 Greatest Hits and a Ken Mellons cut, \u201cI Can\u2019t Kick My Country\u201d for a NASCAR compilation, Inside Traxx.\nTom Wurth found the best school was on the road playing and in the studio recording. He took to both and never looked back. He has shared a stage with some of the most respected and successful artists in music including\nVince Gill, John Ford Coley, T. Graham Brown, Eddie Money, Larry Gatlin and The Gatlin Brothers, Lonestar, Billy Dean, Ronnie Milsap, Rascal Flatts, Billy Currington, LoCash, Pam Tillis, Mel Tillis, Thompson Square, Marty Stuart, Tim Rushlow, Trick Pony, Clay Walker, Tony Coleman & many others.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Tom Wurth for several years. I\u2019ve always appreciated his friendship and what I\u2019ve always admired was his professionalism. As we say in Alabama \u2013 he\u2019s a hard charger. (He\u2019s a) great entertainer, and one of the true inspirations in this business!\u201d \u2013 Marty Raybon\nIn 2006 Wurth signed his first record deal, recorded and released his first album on Aspirion Records. The first release from Tom Wurth, \u201cBread On The Table,\u201d reached the top thirty on the charts as well as earned a spot on CMT.com for the single\u2019s video. Wurth\u2019s next two single releases (\u201cGood Ground,\u201d from the album Tom Wurth and \u201cIf The Road Runs Out,\u201d from If The Road Runs Out) also enjoyed top thirty chart status.\n\"Tom Wurth is a three-way hitter. He's a tremendously gifted vocalist and artist and a Grammy nominated artist. Tom has a genuine love for the song, strong and memorable melody-tunes that people can sing along with. Tom is truly a gifted singer with a style all his own. I think you'll love what you hear.\u201d - John Ford Coley\nThis quote may well explain the feelings both peers and fans have about Tom Wurth and his music. What you hear on Tom Wurth\u2019s records are exactly what you will hear on stage. No smoke, no mirrors just great music.\n\u201cSome time ago Vince Gill finished performing and sat next to me backstage ... I have the same remark about Tom as I said to Vince, \"You did more with just you and a guitar than the act that preceded you with a full band. This is a wonderful talent that should be a much bigger name because he understands what it means to get up on a stage and perform. A wonderful talent.\u201d \u2013 Sandy Smolen\nTom Wurth crossed paths with famed rocker Eddie Money leading to a friendship and several collaborations. Money asked him to produce a special project, The Other Side of Money. Wurth took on the project bringing in John Ford Coley to co-produce the project with him. The album included a remake of Money\u2019s song, \u201cGimme Some Water\u201d and featured Vince Gill. For Tom Wurth\u2019s new project, A Different Soul, Wurth and Money once again collaborated, along with Scott Soderberg, with their co-write of \u201cBack On The Highway Again.\u201d\n\u201cEvery once in a while, someone comes along that has the quality, that believability tone in their voice with a simple but honest emotion, like he\u2019s talking late at night to his sweetheart in a quiet driveway. It\u2019s a gift. Tom Wurth has that gift. \u2013 Eddie Money\nIn 2012, Wurth signed with TaDa Records recording the studio album, Midnight Rain. The album brings together Tom Wurth\u2019s soulful blend of country with his trademark additions of R&B and gospel. Midnight Rain was featured on iTunes New and Noteworthy right off the presses. Singles from the album included, \u201cTo Love Somebody,\u201d and \u201cDiggin in The Dirt.\u201d\nFor Tom Wurth, music isn\u2019t just a vocation, it defines him as a person. If he isn\u2019t crafting a new song, out on the road singing or in the studio recording his own music he often takes to the studio as a producer. His latest project is with John Ford Coley. Coley\u2019s latest album, Eclectic, is a 26 song collection co-produced by Wurth and features Vince Gill, Collin Raye, Jamie O\u2019Neal, Georgia Middleman and T. Graham Brown.\nYet, there is nothing Tom Wurth would rather be doing than singing. This past year and a half he has devoted everything to the making of A Different Soul. There is no \u201cfast forward\u201d to this latest project on TaDa Records.\nIt is part of his artistic progression and builds on his musical roots. A Different Soul has quickly become labeled \u201ca different style, a different sound.\u201d It is not \u201cdifferent\u201d for Tom Wurth, but gives that same \u201cconstant\u201d fans have come to expect from his music. But, it is music different from anything you have heard before.\nThe project includes a song he will say \u201cdefines him.\u201d \u201cWhere I Belong\u201d was written by Wurth with Vince Gill and features Gill on vocals and guitar. For Wurth it is another milestone in his career. Right next to that is another Wurth co-write, \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Build It,\u201d that has his soulful vocals paired with those of another soulful singer, T. Graham Brown. John Ford Coley also appears offering his talents with background vocals on two songs on the project, \u201cOnce A Lover (Always A Friend)\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Make Love.\u201d\nA Different Soul is produced by T. W. Cargile (who also co-produced Wurth\u2019s Midnight Rain) and Tony Coleman (former B.B. King drummer for thirty years).\n\u201cIn my lifetime as a musician, I have had the opportunity and honor to work with the world\u2019s greatest soulful singers \u2013 Otis Clay, Bobby Blue Bland, Johnnie Taylor, Etta James, B.B. King and others. Tom Wurth is one of those soulful singers that I can add to that list. The first time I heard him sing I knew immediately I had to work with him. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of co-producing him on his latest recording, A Different Soul. I consider his voice and singing to be as soulful as those great artists I\u2019ve worked with and grew up listing to whether jazz, blues, country or R&B.

With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015. Previous projects include Home to You from 2010, Topaz City in 2007; One of the Ways, 2002; Wide Afternoon, 2000; Comfort In the Curves, 1997; and three live releases (Sell-Out, 2006; Live From The Granada CD/DVD 2009 and Live At The Mucky Duck - Portmanteau, 2019).

The legendary journalist called the record \u201cone of the least polished first albums I\u2019ve heard in the past year and one of the best\u201d in his review for Rolling Stone.\n\nRobert Palmer of the New York Times wrote that one of the reasons that the Iron City Houserockers \u201chave drawn so much critical praise is that they\u2019re bringing fresh energy to a hallowed and somewhat moribund rock tradition.\u201d\n\nThe band had created a unique sounding blend of blue collar rock informed by their influences which included a deep love of Chicago blues, early rock and roll and old school soul, all mixed together with dollops of the then-current sounds of punk and new wave added in.\n\nTheir second album, 1980\u2019s Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive), found them recording in New York City with an incredible supporting cast. Cleveland International\u2019s Steve Popovich and Marty Mooney tapped Mick Ronson (David Bowie) to co-produce the sessions, with additional input coming from Ian Hunter (Mott The Hoople) and Steven Van Zandt (Bruce Springsteen, Southside Johnny).\n\nHouserockers songwriter and vocalist Joe Grushecky recognized that they were entering into an unique situation. \u201cWe were a particularly effective concert band at that time. We just wanted to kick your ass and tear the place down. That\u2019s the attitude we had and then you had these guys that joined us who had much more experience recording,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey brought a little bit of sophistication to the whole process. You have the English guys and then you had the New Jersey guys and then you had us from Pittsburgh and on paper, it never should have worked. But somehow it did. Everything just fell into place.\u201d\n\nCleveland International Records is celebrating the 40th anniversary of Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive) with a new expanded reissue that is available on CD, vinyl(bonus tracks available via a download card) and on all digital streaming outlets. Grushecky worked with his son, Johnny (who also plays guitar in the current version of the band) and his sound engineer, Brian Coleman, to compile a second disc with an additional 16 tracks, all previously unreleased. More than an hour\u2019s worth of demos and rarities, including alternate takes and in some cases, songs that didn\u2019t make the final running order of the original album, add an intriguing chapter to the existing legend of the record.\n\n\u201cWe always went into a local studio in Pittsburgh and I would write songs. Some of the guys would bring in some ideas and we would demo everything,\u201d Grushecky recalls. \u201cMost of the demos, when we were recording them, we weren\u2019t setting out to make a final product. So a lot of this stuff is just first and second takes to see what the song sounded like.\u201d\n\nGoing through reel-to-reel tapes and even some cassettes that had been in boxes for decades, Grushecky found he had an abundance of material. \u201cAt first, I thought we were just going to include a couple of extra tracks on this reissue. Then I started finding all of these different things and I started to get excited about it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, to some people, I\u2019m sure it would be like a great lost Iron City Houserockers record.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Tune in to a special edition of LIVE & Joe's Place.

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe. Their show is a carnival of two that will take you from the Moulin Rouge to CBGBs and back again.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose. Or, as Hubbard put it best to Plankenhorn way back at the start of his journey, \u201cThere\u2019s your proof.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Steve Wariner ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7043862.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Steve Wariner is a four-time GRAMMY winner, having won in 1992 for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals; and in 2000 and 2009 for Best Country Instrumental Performance, before his Chet Atkins tribute earned him the Country Instrumental GRAMMY in 2010.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes.

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to.

The legendary Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, TX is hosting two nights of sold-out shows with headliner Michael Martin Murphey and his opening act Willie Nelson. Until now, the Armadillo has presented mostly rock acts.\nRolling Stone magazine has heard the shows might be special so it sends their top man in Texas, Chet Flippo, to cover the event. Flippo soon declares in Rolling Stone that Murphey is \u201cthe best new songwriter in America.\u201d\nMurphey has just released his acclaimed genre-bending Geronimo\u2019s Cadillac, and on this night he and Nelson present their unique fusions of pop, rock, folk, cowboy ballads, hard-core country, jazz and reddirt bluegrass. It is a night that defies all the music norms of the time; a night that some will call \u201cthe birth of modern Americana music.\u201d\n\u201cMurphey was a key player in the Austin phenomenon,\u201d Craig Havighurst of WMOT \u2014 The String recently observed. \u201cMurphey, along with Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker and others forged a country-rock hybrid that became the foundation for the progressive folk music field we now call \u2018Americana\u2019.\u201d\nNow 50 years after he began pioneering that music scene and laid the foundation for what we now call Americana music, Murphey presents Austinology: Alleys of Austin. It is both a celebration of that era and a look at the seminal period that turned Austin into one of the music capitals of the world.\nNative Texan Murphey already had songwriting success in Los Angeles when he returned to Texas and landed in Austin in the late 1960s. Still, Murphey says moving to Austin made him a better songwriter and a better performer due to the friendly association with other writers and performers who followed him to Austin and gave birth a burgeoning creative community that included Jerry Jeff Walker, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffett, Gary P. Nunn and other soon-to-be legends like Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt.\nFor Austinology: Alleys of Austin, Murphey chose music styles that defined the period as he explores why it perpetuated itself. He is joined by several artists who were part of that era as well as those influenced by the work the originators created:\n\u2022 Willie Nelson (on \u201cAlleys of Austin\u201d and \u201cCosmic Cowboy\u201d)\n\u2022 Steve Earle (on \u201cGeronimo\u2019s Cadillac\u201d),\n\u2022 Lyle Lovett (on \u201cAlleys of Austin,\u201d \u201cCosmic Cowboy\u201d and \u201cDrunken Lady of the Morning\u201d)\n\u2022 Kelly Willis and Bruce Robison (on \u201cLittle Bird\u201d)\n\u2022 Jerry Jeff Walker (on \u201cCosmic Cowboy,\u201d \u201cAlleys of Austin\u201d)\n\u2022 Amy Grant (on \u201cWildfire\u201d)\n\u2022 Randy Rogers (\u201cBackslider\u2019s Wine\u201d)\n\u2022 The Last Bandoleros (on Guy Clark\u2019s \u201cLA Freeway\u201d)\n\u201cThis album is not just about my songs,\u201d Murphey said. \u201cIt\u2019s about style and substance that makes a song that stands the test of time, a song that has a chance of living on in the Great American Songbook.\n\u201cSo I did my personal take on songs by Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Jerry Jeff Walker, Allan Damron as well as songs made popular by Willie and Waylon,\u201d he continued. \u201cI stayed with songs that came out when I was there \u2013 between 1968 and 1974 \u2014 because I personally experienced what the impact of that songwriting style was on the culture. [Laughs] Because I was there, you know? And I grew up with the mix that created the original American music: African- American Blues and Spirituals, Tejano/Irish/ German/ Cowboy Ballads and Dance tunes including Native American music.\u201d\nMurphey has traveled extensively and engaged in ranching throughout the West, but remained a Texas resident through it all, even as he topped the International and National Pop, Country, Bluegrass and Western music charts with such huge crossover hits as \u201cWildfire,\u201d \u201cCarolina In The Pines,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Forever For,\u201d \u201cLong Line of Love,\u201d \u201cGeronimo\u2019s Cadillac\u201d and \u201cCowboy Logic.\u201d\nThrough all the chart-jumping and genre busting, Murphey has remained constant to an honest, sincere approach to his songwriting. He is no more country than rock, no more bluegrass than classical, no more folk than jazz. He is, rather, a true AMERICAN songwriter. His stubborn determination to be the best songwriter possible has led to his songs being covered by such artists as Lyle Lovett, John Denver, Kenny Rogers, Hoyt Axton, Cher, Manfred Mann, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, and more.\nMurphey came of age in the local Southwestern folk music scene, starting with a Bohemian club called the Rubiyat in Dallas and other acoustic venues in Austin, Houston, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Denver.\nAfter briefly attending the University of North Texas (which had its own thriving music school), Murphey transferred to UCLA and worked his way through college as a singer / songwriter while excelling as a student of poetry, songwriter and performer.\nBut a growing family and the pull of his Texas Cowboy roots brought him back to Austin in 1968 \u2013 where he began a new musical movement with the help of Rod Kennedy (founder of Kerrville Folk Festival), Segle Fry (club manager and folksinger) and UT ethnomusicologist Roger Abrams. In May of 2018, the Country Music Hall of Fame honored Murphey\u2019s contribution as a founding member of the Austin music scene as part of their three year Outlaws and Armadillos exhibit. He\u2019s come full circle to his Cowboy roots, having recently been given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum and Cowboy Hall of Fame.\nPerhaps most striking about Austinology: Alleys of Austin is how good songs weather the years, which is precisely why such celebrated songwriters as Earle, Grant, Walker, Nelson, Lovett and as artists like Garth Brooks, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Ray Wylie Hubbard and more cite Murphey as a major influence on their own craft.\nWith the release of Michael Martin Murphey\u2019s Austinology: Alleys of Austin, his legacy is impacting new generations.", "otherInfo": "Live performances by Michael and friends from their homes and usually solo performances.

It's a bright album for cloudy times, filled with a sense of buoyancy \u2014 an anthemic synthesizer here, a four-on-the-floor drumbeat there \u2014 that emphasizes hope and renewal over sorrow.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band.

They tour the Northwest regularly as a duo, and put on theatrical shows with their full ensemble. They are alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriters Project and have played before Randy Newman.\n\nPortland's The Bylines exists in a unique musical plane, one at once grounded in the big-band past of glamorous pop performances and rooted in a present realm of intricate and highly addictive songwriting. With a focus on grand live spectacle--a facet of music often lost in the digital age--the group is equally at home in velvet-curtained jazz halls, large rooms and intimate venues.\n\nThat sound is the product of a marriage both sonic and literal. The Bylines is made up of two songwriters whose styles and influences converge to bring The Bylines' catchy, addictive sounds to vibrant life. Frontwoman Marianna Thielen, the glamorous face of the group, brings to the fore a background in composition, classical vocal work and, most obviously, musical theater, illuminating the stage with endlessly watchable bravado backed up by her powerful -- yet playful -- vocal prowess. Meanwhile, gliding his fingers across the keys is Reece Marshburn, letting loose a symphony of intricate melodies rooted in a combination of classical, jazz and pop music.\n\nThe resulting combination is a unique pop confection drawing on decades of influences, as if Cole Porter, Carole King, Dusty Springfield, Freddie Mercury, Paul Simon, Rufus Wainwright and Regina Spektor combined forces and filtered their unique compositions through classical maestros and film composers, then sprinkled it with a keen pop sensibility and a commitment to putting on the most involving, charismatic and personalized live shows this side of the Copacabana.\n\nThe Bylines have used their unique-yet-familiar sound to play to audiences large and small throughout the country, and have released both a studio(self titled, recorded by Bob Stark at Kung Fu Bakery) and a live album(The Bylines Live, recorded at the Alberta Rose Theatre in Portland, OR). The Bylines are proud alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriting Project, and have had support from the Regional Arts and Culture Council.\n\nWhether performing as a Thielen/Marshburn duo or with a larger band, the result is a blend of butter-smooth melodies, densely layered songwriting and powerful vocals. Most importantly, though, The Bylines musical cocktail goes down easy, and emphasizes something that is so often forgotten when such prolific songwriters present their craft: listening to music is, above all, supposed to be an experience\u2026 and a fun one.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ So Hype ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7069503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "DJ So Hype", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Derrick Reeves, known as Hype or DJ So Hype, is an American DJ and producer of segway music. \u201cHype\u201d, meaning extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion., suits his personality and skill-set perfectly when talking about his craft.

It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cWEST COAST WEDNESDAYS\u201d EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.\n\nJim\u2019s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols (a young Lydon was connected to Jim\u2019s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.\n\nHeath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease, Whole New Life, which Heath calls \u201cthe most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.\u201d\n\nCall it a new twist on an old sound, Whole New Life was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band\u2019s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna \u2018RJ\u2019 Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend\u2019s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. \u201cI love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.\u201d\n\nRecording the album, Heath recalled that \u201cBack in the 1950\u2019s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I\u2019m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice. Whole New Life brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tour started around 1986,\u201d Heath chuckles dryly. REVEREND HORTON HEAT still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton\u2019s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton\u2019s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term \u2018Special Guests\u2019 on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, \u201cThe idea of playing in Jerry\u2019s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we\u2019ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we\u2019ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where REVEREND HORTON HEAT is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do \u2018Ace Of Spades.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.\u2019 He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said \u2018Never give them what they want, give them what they need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you, REVEREND HORTON HEAT is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.\n\nWhole New Life was delivered November 30, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tony Lucca ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10131981.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Singer-songwriter, Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tony Lucca is a Nashville-based singer/songwriter whose catalog of music runs the gamut from soul-infused pop to tear-jerker folk balladry.

It only took eight years of waiting for one of the most unique artists to finally deliver a new dose of contemporary electro pyrotechnics and a worthy successor to the smashing Total. During those eight years, SebastiAn successfully completed a 360\u00b0 turn. Plus, it\u2019s been eight years of putting his talent to the good use of others (Frank Ocean, Philippe Katerine, Charlotte Gainsbourg) to help him get to where he wants to be today. From European electro to American R&B via classic pop, Thirst sets ablaze all genres. His taste for explosive mechanisms (like his well-known \u201cturbine\u201d techno sub-genre label-mates at Ed Banger) made Total an elegantly revolutionary debut album that captivatingly took things to the extreme, while being as frightening as a ticking bomb. But now, the wait is over. Thirst bursts forward providing an amazing opening to brand new worlds. This 14-track adventure narrates the journey of how he mastered machines, his own demons and even several time zones.\n\n\u201cThe general approach to this record corresponds to the time when Frank Ocean called me in Paris, telling me I had to be in Los Angeles the next day to work alongside him,\u201d reveals SebastiAn. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019d met Charlotte Gainsbourg to produce her latest album. So I found myself working with these two opposing personalities: on one side you\u2019ve got Frank Ocean, who\u2019s ultra charismatic and fanciful, while on the other, Charlotte Gainsbourg is both an introvert yet so openly real. When Charlotte moved to New York, Frank landed in London, and so the work process suddenly switched. I found this really interesting. My record came about from all the encounters I made going between these two projects.\u201d The energy from such contrasts brought this project to life, provoking SebastiAn to call upon an impressive list of artists to feature on Thirst (Syd from The Internet, Mayer Hawthorne, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Allan Kingdom, Sevdaliza, Cautious Clay, Sunni Col\u00f2n, Sparks, Gallant and Loota). \u201cFrom Ed Banger to Jean-Louis Costes and Katerine, or Frank Ocean to Charlotte Gainsbourg, my music has always looked to build bridges,\u201d outlines the self-confessed fan of DJ Premier, Giorgio Moroder and Suicide, who\u2019s managed to bring different styles together as one on this record. From this head-on collision between cold European techno and the warm tones of R&B, hip-hop and American gospel comes a series of explosions which progressively topple towards unchartered territories. With a certain Slavic melancholy that\u2019s an homage to his roots, SebastiAn makes the single Beograd evolve from metronomic dirty disco to a melody of cinematographic stature worthy of De Roubaix, entangled in a Chopin-esque lamenting sonata. The art of SebastiAn is certainly the art of suspense. He\u2019s like a tightrope walker, juggling a balancing act from the intimate to the epic (just take Run For Me which is a tour de force), and from minimalism to baroque to create a mystical form of electronic music. Thirst has such a contemporary edge to it, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s not aiming for a total collision between music\u2019s major current trends (electro and R&B), but in fact he\u2019s looking to rearrange the rules, settling alight the history of pop (The Beach Boys-eque Better Now) and rock (Handcuffed To A Parking Meter reaching dizzying heights with his idols Sparks), and a certain classicism in a recurring dialogue between strings, piano and knob-twiddling machines.\n\nIn 2011, for the cover work for Total, Jean-Baptiste Mondino captured SebastiAn as a modern-day Narcissus, photographing the musician kissing his alter ego. Eight years later, the same photographer once again depicts the artist with his double, however this time the love affair has ended and it\u2019s fists up ready for a fight. To sum up this game of metaphors, Thirst is a beefed-up declaration of love - not of SebastiAn to himself, but to the world around him. Thirst leaves you thirsty for more.", "otherInfo": "Meditate with Stuart"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gaty Lopez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10342800.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Friends, Electronic, Tech House", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Gaty Lopez started his DJ career in 1989, working on many radios and clubs.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "A different theme every day!

He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "EOB ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9782540.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dash Berlin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10377967.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Music", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Top 25' Dash Berlin including the new singles 'Home' and 'Love Out Loud'!

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans.

A student of house music, Williams has accomplished a full sweep of merited recognition that has accelerated over the last five years.\nEmerging onto the house scene in 2010, T.Williams instantly marked himself as a breakthrough artist with a difference; his unique take on house music has been fruitful has in turn, rewarded him with a loyal allegiance of supporters. Whilst he may appear new to the house scene, Tesfa Williams is far from a newcomer to music with almost twenty years of experience behind him having cut his teeth in the grime scene as Dread.D.\n\nSigned at the tender age of 17 to Jon E Cash\u2019s Black Op\u2019s with \u2018Invasion\u2019, Williams went on to have mass success in the grime and bass world, selling thousands of singles worldwide. After a five year reign in the realm of grime, Williams found himself veering towards the world of house music.\n\nIn 2010 a number of zeitgeist releases from Williams proved too good to ignore, one such release was hit record \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 featuring vocalist Terri Walker. The track played extensively worldwide before settling in at no.2 as iTunes best dance track of the year. In 2011 T.Williams defined himself further by releasing solo works on his own Deep Teknologi imprint, Local Action and Pattern.\n\nWilliams\u2019 remixes for Maya Jane Coles, Charli XCX, Ben Westbeech and Skream were also received with high regard. The end of 2011 saw T.Williams receive a number of accolades and cemented his ability to carve out a career as a serious taste maker. He was nominated as \u2018Best Breakthrough DJ\u2019 by DJ Mag, named as one of the \u2018DJ Stars of 2012\u2019 by Time Out and picked by The Guardian for his Fact Magazine mix as one of their favourites of the year.\n\nIn 2012, two relationships came to the fore and propelled Williams to even greater heights. The first was his weekly show on the legendary London radio station, Rinse FM, a show that featured the likes of Jessie Ware, Soul Clap, MK, Dusky and Duke Dumont as guests; culminating in T mixing Rinse 21, one of the most vital of the renowned mix series to date.\n\nWith all of these accolades behind him T.Williams signed to PMR records in 2013 alongside the likes of Julio Bashmore & Disclosure. He gained a spot on the prestigious Radio 1 \u201cResidency\u201d which facilitated a number of bookings and performances at multiple clubs and festivals around the world, by the end of 2014 Williams had performed over 100 shows across 4 different continents. Having accumulated a global perspective from touring the world, the aficionado started a new Label \"Today,Tomorrow Records\u201d with the focus on releasing music from the pool of talented people he had made connections with over the years.\n\nThis lead to a massive collaboration with UK garage legend MJ Cole in 2015, on the labels first EP \u201cAcoustic Treatment\u201d which gained huge support from Radio 1\u2019s Danny Howard. This seal of approval saw Tesfa play at London's world renowned Fabric, in room 1 alongside Groove Armada and Moxie. He also completed a number of successful headline tours to showcase the EP, which saw him return to Australia, Asia and North America, much to the delight of his die hard following.\n\nSigning and releasing a fresh EP on New York's long standing classic House label \u201cStrictly Rhythm\u201d and hitting the No.2 spot on Radio 1\u2019s dance chart with collab \"Do You\u201d saw T.Williams picked by Traxsource as 1 of their \u201c10 Artist To Watch\u201d in 2016.\n\n2017 looks ever brighter for the West Londoner as he starts work on Vol.3 of his \"Sodality\u201d Series whilst collaborating with Julio Bashmore and James Jacob, all the while further expanding his global touring schedule.", "otherInfo": "T.Williams digging in the crates and playing an all vinyl live stream set!!

Barely two weeks have passed since he wrapped up a support tour for Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder, and more than five years have gone by since there was a month when he wasn\u2019t on stage. Not to mention the albums: Rhythm and Repose (2012), the Grammy-nominated Didn\u2019t He Ramble (2015), and a soon to be released Between Two Shores (2018); a bevy of EPs; and to top it off, a five week \u201cCamino by sea\u201d in a traditional Irish naomho\u0301g, a journey which was captured on film and released as the full-length The Camino Voyage (2018).\n\nHe has earned both his exhaustion and now his respite: a month in one place. Taking a residency at the Centre Culturel Irlandais, Hansard has come to France to put shape to a new album. The intention is to create \u201can acoustic record with sparse accompaniment\u201d in concert with long-time friends and collaborators Joe Doyle (bass), ROMY (piano, string arrangements, and vocals), and Javier Mas (Spanish guitar, lau\u0301d).\n\nParis, however, has other plans. One night at dinner, friend, author, and classical singer Judith Mok introduces Hansard to the Khoshravesh brothers, who studied classical and traditional music in their native Iran before relocating to Paris. The simple meal quickly turns into a session. Hansard recalls working through one song particularly. \u201cThe Khoshravesh brothers joined me and I was transported. The song took on a new depth: I heard it differently, and new possibilities emerged. The ease by which they followed their own melodic line while being sympathetic to mine was intoxicating.\u201d By the end of the night, the brothers agreed to join Hansard in Black Box studios, where he will be working with producer David Odlum, and what was to be a straightforward album begins to take an interesting turn.\n\nThe roster of musicians quickly increases. Along with Joe Doyle, Romy, and the Khoshravesh brothers, Hansard invites Dublin electronic musicians Dunk Murphy (Sunken Foal) and Deasy to participate in the sessions, eager to see what might spark from the diverse range of musical traditions. Each day is unwritten, defined by an openness, a willingness to follow the spirit of the moment wherever it may lead. \u201cWhen you surround yourself with great musicians and do your best to keep up, stay loose, give little direction, and allow everyone to bring what they bring, something transformative may happen,\u201d Hansard says.\n\nOver the next few months, more musicians cycle in: Graham Hopkins and Earl Harvin (drums, percussion), Michael Buckley (saxophone, horns and flute), Breannda\u0301n O\u0301 Beaglaoich (accordion), Rosie McKenzie (violin), Aida Shahghasemi (Iranian singer and daf player), Eamon O\u2019Leary (banjo, bouzouki, and mandolin), Anna Roberts-Gevalt, (fiddle), Bri\u0301an Mac Gloinn (Ye Vagabonds, fiddle), Marke\u0301ta Irglova\u0301 (vocals), and Rob Moose (strings arrangements). They work with no agenda, no preconceived notion of what the sessions will turn into. But by April, it\u2019s clear that an album has emerged from this group exercise. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Hansard, \u201cwhen you take a small musical fragment and you care for it, follow it and build it up slowly, it can become a thing of wonder.\u201d\n\nThe resulting album, This Wild Willing (April 12, ANTI- Records), is indeed a collection of wondrous things.\nThose who have followed Hansard\u2019s career since his Academy Award winning turn in the film Once will have witnessed one artistic arc: the journey of a Dublin busker who cut his teeth on the greats - Dylan, Van Morrison, Leonard Cohen \u2013 and followed the path of the troubadour, the singer-songwriter to great effect.\n\nBut there is another thread running through Glen Hansard\u2019s musicianship. In his decades as lead singer of Irish stalwarts The Frames, rock and folk ambitions coexist with moments of strangeness, intimacy, and stillness: love songs drowning in the last fevers of the Spanish Flu (\u201cSanta Maria\u201d), protagonists who ponder throwing it all away and disappearing in a fugue state (\u201cKeepsake\u201d). And above all, the band, veering from silence to cacophony, ready to underpin soaring emotional and dynamic shifts.\nThis Wild Willing marks an inflection point in his career, a turning where he marries the sonic inventiveness of the best of his work in The Frames to the discipline he\u2019s found as a lyricist in his solo career.\n\nIt is an album guided and formed by the twin totems of resolve and surrender \u2013 the resolve to see a thing through alongside a willingness to surrender, to trust in that which lies outside yourself \u2013 the other musicians in the room, your lover, your healer, your audience.\n\nLead track \u201cI\u2019ll Be You Be Me\u201d finds Hansard weighing the risks of such vulnerability, of the giving of oneself to another. His restrained vocal belies the fury of the underlying instrumental\u2019s building storm. \u201cI\u2019ll be you, be me and I\u2019ll be you/I\u2019ll take your truth, your lies, your secrets,\u201d he sings, negotiating the consuming potential of desire. There is danger here, but it is without rancor or ill-will \u2013 the danger of a hare with its belly exposed. There is also a duality in the invitation: the audience is drawn in just as surely as the song\u2019s object, to the immersive world conjured by the album.\n\nA sense of unease lingers in the mysterious \u201cClosing Door\u201d and \u201cRace to the Bottom.\u201d The latter serves as a sort of diary of Hansard\u2019s residency in Paris, finding him \u201ccoughing my lungs up on the Rue des Irlandais/becoming a risk to myself\u201d an \u201c\u2019X\u2019 on my back\u201d as he wanders the city. Hansard insists, \u201cIt\u2019s more about the decline of a person or persons rather than of human kind,\u201d and yet it is hard to escape the sense that a collective worry is being tapped into, with the desecration of Joan of Arc in one memorable line echoing the more recent destruction of the statue of Marianne \u2013 that other great symbol of France \u2013 in the unrest that beset the country in the winter of 2018. It is lyric as prognostication, somehow in tune with coming shockwaves.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all darkness, however. \u201cDon\u2019t Settle,\u201d one of the few tracks not recorded in France, retains the raw energy of the various tour sound checks which brought it to life. It offers not warning, but guidance, as it considers paths of original artistic voices -\nShane McGowan, Lisa O\u2019Neill, Woody Guthrie, and James Baldwin to name a few \u2013 and implores younger artists to stay the course. It finds its conclusion on the record\u2019s penultimate track, \u201cGood Life of Song,\u201d summing up the possibility inherent in the bardic path. For Hansard \u201cthere\u2019s joy and sorrow for me in this recording, where they meet is a hallowed spot.\u201d Alongside these is a trio of songs: \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d\n\nand, \u201cThreading Water,\u201d each of which is presented so openly that it is easy forget that they are exploring private, intimate territory rarely seen in Hansard\u2019s lyrics. Here is Hansard at home in Ireland, rambling through October, preparing for winter. Here is a declaration of love, a poem put to song. Here is simple gratitude for a good life.\n\nThe album ends with the deceptively simple, \u201cLeave a Light...\u201d Lingering in the melody is the memory of a journey undertaken with friends, those living and those who have sailed on. And in the lyric is a path out, from disorder and discord, into the place where surrender and resolve meet. \u201cSo, say goodbye to the long, cold winter,\u201d Hansard sings, \u201cAnd farewell to all we\u2019ve left behind. Leave a light on and come out of the shadows.

Described by Mojo as \u201cunashamedly lush, lovely, classic pop\u201d, it featured in the magazine\u2019s Top 10 Americana Albums of 2019, garnering further praise across the board, including from the Scottish Express who awarded it a five-star review, declaring - as The Independent once did - that Bruntnell is \u201cone of the best songwriters in Britain\u201d.\n\nPeter Bruntnell has been receiving much the same consistently high praise, since his debut album Cannibal - released in 1995 through Almo Sounds. NME told its readers that \u201chis songs should be taught in schools\u201d; \u201cone of England's best kept musical secrets\u201d, said Rolling Stone; \u201cMelodically rich, lyrically ingenious and emotionally, intellectually affecting songs that bears comparison with the all-time greats\u201d, wrote The Guardian in their 2016 Cult Heroes feature on Bruntnell.\n\n2020 sees Peter Bruntnell re-join forces with London-based indie label Loose, to re-issue his influential and diverse catalogue, beginning in April with Peter\u2019s first 2 albums: Cannibal and Camelot In Smithereens. Both albums were originally released on Jerry Moss and Herb Albert\u2019s post A&M imprint Almo Sounds - the original home to Garbage and Gillian Welch amongst others. April also saw the release of Black Mountain UFO, a now very hard to find album originally released in 2011. All three albums are being made available digitally for the first time.\n\nOn Record Store Day 2020 Loose are releasing Bruntnell\u2019s seminal americana album Normal For Bridgwater. Upon release in June 1999, NME described it as \u201ca diabolic pact between Uncle Tupelo and The Eagles\u201d, whilst Mojo made it their Americana Album Of The Month, saying, \u201cI defy anyone not to be moved by the superb songwriting\u201d and The Independent told us that \u201cif this collection doesn\u2019t get him widespread recognition, then the world\u2019s an ugly place. A true and beautiful gem\u201d. The limited edition white vinyl release of Normal For Bridgwater will be available exclusively for Record Store Day 2020.\n\nPraise for Bruntnell also comes from the likes of musician and author Willy Vlautin (The Delines, Richmond Fontaine), who frequently states that \u201cPeter Bruntnell is my favourite singer in the world\u201d, with Jay Farrar (Son Volt, Uncle Tupelo) and Peter Buck (REM) also amongst his fans.

But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar. The best is yet to come.", "otherInfo": "\"Be More Kind\" in full!\n\nThis show is a slightly different one. Free to watch, everyone welcome, I'll be encouraging people to buy records and merch, to keep @Xtra_Mile and my merch folks in house and home.

Shorr was born and raised in Portland, Maine on July 11, 1994, where she was the youngest of seven children born to a single mother. Shorr soaked up a rich variety of influences from her siblings, and at the age of six, she began writing songs. At 13, Shorr learned to play guitar and gained experience playing in a rock band in Portland, singing Pink Floyd and Nirvana covers in a friend\u2019s basement. While she loved rock and pop, Shorr was certain that her future lay in country music after hearing Johnny Cash's cover of \"Hurt, originally by Nine Inch Nails. Determined to make her mark, Shorr took extra classes so she could graduate from high school early, and then held down two jobs at once so she could raise the money to move to Nashville.\n\nBy the time she was 19, Shorr had settled in Music City, and she landed a job at a hot dog stand while she searched for an audience to hear her songs. Things began looking up for Shorr when she became part of a weekly songwriter\u2019s showcase called Song Suffragettes that highlights the work of talented female singer/songwriters in Nashville. Song Suffragettes helped raise Shorr\u2019s profile which resulted in her first publishing deal, solidifying her dream of becoming a professional musician in Nashville.\n\nWith two of her fellow Suffragettes, Hailey Steele and Lena Stone, Shorr wrote a song about resilience titled \u201cFight Like A Girl\u201d and released it as an independent digital single in January 2016. The tune quickly won positive press and airplay on digital radio and social media sources with SiriusXM\u2019s The Highway channel naming Shorr a \u201cHighway Find\u201d and CMT making her part of their \u201cArtist Discovery\u201d program. With that momentum, she released The Y2K Mixtape, an eight-song collection of some of Shorr\u2019s earliest music that led to her becoming 2016\u2019s second best-selling debut female in all of country music (behind only Grammy-winner Maren Morris).\n\nAirplay of a second single, \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You\u201d, led into 2017 where Shorr and her next EP, Slingshot, received a barrage of critical acclaim from Rolling Stone Country (\u201cArtist You Need To Know\u201d), Taste of Country (\u201c2017\u2019s Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d), Sounds Like Nashville, Morning Hangover, Country Music Chat, Whiskey Riff and CMT. Teen Vogue came calling and in May 2017, the publication named Shorr one of \u201c10 Female Artists Who Are Changing the Music Game\u201d. She was the only country artist featured in their annual music issue which specifically dubbed Shorr \u201cThe New Nashville\u201d. Later that year, Kalie was named to the CMT Next Women of Country Class of 2018, a prestigious list that recognizes the newest and brightest female artists in country music.\n\nCreatively, Shorr spent most of 2017 writing songs and working on a new sound that infuses her country core with many of the rock influences she grew up on. Producer and songwriter Skip Black (Jana Kramer, Theory of a Deadman) helped her finally find the common thread that connects the big guitars of rock music to the story-telling and passion for lyric that cements her in country. It was a deep dive into song craftsmanship and sonic production that yielded her first 2018 single, \u201cTwo Hands\u201d, featured on Shorr\u2019s newest EP Awake.\n\nAmidst critical acclaim for her punk-country sound on Awake, Kalie was named one of the \u201cTop 10 Country Artists To Watch In 2018\u201d by the Huffington Post just as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d was added to prominent playlists at SiriusXM The Highway, Radio Disney Country, TuneIn's Country Roads, Pandora, Amazon Music and Apple Music. The \u201cTwo Hands\u201d music video was also added to CMT, GAC and to Vevo's DSCVR Country playlist.\n\nIn January 2018 after being inspired by speeches at the Golden Globe Awards, Kalie co-wrote a song called \u201cTimes-Up\u201d that went on to be recorded by 23 women of Song Suffragettes with an accompanying music video that received major press coverage from the Associated Press, Boston Globe, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, Voice of America and many more including a feature on Grammy.com.\n\nShorr recently wrapped the CMT Next Women of Country Tour with country superstars Sara Evans and RaeLynn and will continue extensive touring throughout the summer.\n\nIn May, Shorr was the only independent artist named to Taste of Country\u2019s \u201c2018 Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d list just as her brand new single \u201cCandy\u201d hit radio airwaves and streaming playlists.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Land of Deborah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8483476.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Singer-songwriter Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "WELCOME TO THE LAND!\n\nThe Land of Deborah is an award-winning singer-songwriter and composer with a unique take on life, love and the pursuit of fair trade chocolate.\n\nBorn and raised in England, Deborah is a trans-national artist who now calls Vancouver, BC home.\n\nShe has been described in the press as \u201c...feel good folk-pop\u201d and as having \u201c...one of the smoothest voices in the city\u201d.\n\nFor video: youtube.com/TheLandofDeborah\nFacebook: facebook.com/TheLandofDeborah\nInstagram: instagram.com/TheLandofDeborah\nFor more info please go to http://thelandofdeborah.com/bio", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nothing More ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10382570.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Metalcore, Hard Rock, Alternative, Progressive Rock, Metal, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rock", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Giulia Millanta ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7958240.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Americana, Indie Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "She tours the U.S. and Europe.Singer-songwriter, Giulia (Julia) Millanta, is a native-born Italian from Florence who now calls Austin, Texas home.

The way their voices blend together in song conjures an imagined romance, much like their own. Before they met, Benjamin and Mia worked hard at their craft but each felt separately, something was missing. Their first songwriting session together, in 2004, led to the discovery that what they were missing was each other. Fast forward to today, they have now released five studio albums, one live album, were named semi-finalists at the 2018 International Songwriting Competition, and were nominated at the 2018 International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nTheir most recent project, \u201cLive at Home\u201d was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, at a house concert in Azalea\u2019s living room. The recording captures the acoustic heart and soul of six songs from their 2017 studio release, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, two new original songs, and a cover of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d, from the motion picture \u201cOnce\u201d. Tickets were sold as a crowdfunding perk to help raise funds to record the aforementioned studio release.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was released on October 13, 2017 and was supported by a multi-province 2 week tour. Written and recorded in their home studio, this project features love songs, beautiful vocal harmony and showcases Benjamin & Mia\u2019s musical abilities. The album sits comfortably in the \u201cContemporary Roots\u201d genre featuring songs that borrow from North American and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as conventional pop sensibilities.\n\n\u201cI See The Church\u201d from the album \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was nominated at the 2018 IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) in the \u201cBest Group/Duo\u201d category .\n\nHamilton Blues Lovers Blog has this to say about the album,\n\n\u201cHamilton musical duo, Azalea keeps growing with every recording and their latest, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d proves it. The production is amazing and they\u2019ve created a fabulous melding of pop and roots music. Their lush vocal harmonies flow through the entire album as the sometimes infectious and always beautiful melodies bolster the sound. It\u2019s a perfect mix of vocals and music that can\u2019t help but effect you emotionally\u2026\u201d\n\nIn May 2015 Azalea was hand picked by GigSalad & CD Baby to play their junket for Canadian Music Week in Toronto, Ontario. In honour of this occasion, Azalea recorded and released a limited edition EP called \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d. As a salute to GigSalad & CD Baby\u2019s DIY methodology, \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d was made completely in house with fabric bound hand packaging.\n\nIn 2013, Azalea released the EP \"Inside Out\". An album which streamlined their folk- tinged pop sound and showcased songs to tug at the heart strings with haunting melodic and harmonic lines. Reminiscent of The Civil Wars, and Fleetwood Mac \u201cInside Out\u201d shed light on Azalea\u2019s Alt-Country side. The pitch for its successful crowd- funding campaign gave some insight into their work:\n\n\". . . it has always been our goal to release quality music that is culturally relevant and speaks to the heart. . . . However, we wanted to take listeners on a journey beyond the routine of everyday life to the place that connects them with their emotions, beliefs, and values in a real way.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012 Azalea released \u201cAt the End of This Year...\u201d, their seasonal single which has received the nod of approval from CBC radio.\n\nAzalea\u2019s 2010 release, \u201cCoffee & Kisses EP\", was among the top three finalists for Recording of the Year, Rock Recording of the Year, Instrumentalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the 2010 Durham Region Music Awards. The album was featured in prominent music magazines and generated good response from college radio across Ontario.\n\nYears before anyone knew Benjamin & Mia Hackett as Azalea, they performed, travelled, and recorded an album as Benjamin & Mia. \u201cThe Carousel of Life\u201d (2007) is the root of their love for each other and for their musical life together. That first album thrust them into the life they know, love, and hope to express in song, to every listener.\n\nAzalea\u2019s chemistry is undeniable - their stage presence magnetic! To experience Azalea in concert is to be invited into their love story. They will will draw you in and pull on your hearts strings. Azalea will take you on an emotional rollercoaster as they move through their repertoire of simple & sweet love songs, then take you south with swampy tunes which are full of rich vocal harmony and live looping. Two complementary voices supported by guitar, piano, \"suitcase-kick-drum\u201d, and foot tambourine create a breathtaking concert experience.\n\nA must see for fans of \u201cFleetwood Mac\u201d, \u201dThe Civil Wars\u201d, and the film \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d.\n\nAzalea is currently performing on board cruise ships around the world.

Songwriters Sima Cunnningham and Macie Stewart formed their unbreakable bond performing throughout the fringes of Chicago's many interlocking communities, collaborating with titans from the city's indie rock, hip-hop, and improvised worlds. But together, along with drummer Matt Carroll, they've stretched the boundaries of what guitar music can do starting with the band's experimental 2016 self-titled EP and their adventurous debut 2018 LP Parts. Now their longstanding partnership culminates with the stunning and muscular follow-up Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nOhmme formed in 2014 as an outlet for Cunningham and Stewart to explore an unconventional approach to their instruments. \"That's the whole genesis of the band: us walking up to our guitars and saying, 'how can we make this noisemaker do something different?'\" says Cunningham. But as their musical collaboration strengthened, bringing Parts and intensive tours with acts like Wilco, Iron & Wine, Twin Peaks, and more, the band's scope and focus has also broadened. Fantasize Your Ghost is the direct result of the band spending more time on the road than in Chicago, a record deeply concerned with questions of the self, the future, and what home means when you're travelling all the time.\n\n\"Grinding on tour last year for so long, it can alter your mental state where you have to think about your life in a different way than you would if you're home. A lot of the songs stemmed from just thinking about all of the possibilities that life could be and could take,\" says Stewart. On the commanding single \"3 2 4 3,\" which tackles the terrifying realization of needing to make a change. The song opens with the two singing in transfixing harmony, \"Looked in the mirror the other day / Caught my reflection / My mouth had moved a different way / The muscles were straining.\" Their deft scene-setting and the way their disparate voices blend together heightens the song's inherent anxiety. Later, they sing, \"Filling the holes to make amends / Tearing them up to start again.\" These moments of emotional clarity fill Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nWritten across 2019, early sketches of the album's tracklist were demoed at Sam Evian's Flying Cloud Studios in upstate New York. \"That's where we really started to see the record come together,\" says Cunningham. The sessions were intensely collaborative and open: the product of long, existential conversations between Stewart and Cunningham in the van about their lives and how to channel the anger they were feeling about the state of the world. Tracks like the driving opener \"Flood Your Gut\" underwent several revisions with Ohmme uncovering several new directions the song could go before finishing it. The refrain \"your whole vision's not enough\" is a call to action, says Cunningham. \"Do you want to be someone who can disconnect or someone who is hyper-engaged and present?\"\n\nFantasize Your Ghost was recorded over a six day session in August 2019 when the band decamped to the Post Farm in southern Wisconsin, where Cunningham runs a yearly DIY music festival. With indie rock journeyman producer Chris Cohen and the idyllic setting just outside Chicago, the songs came to vibrant life. Though Parts showcased their wildly burgeoning influences and talents, Fantasize Your Ghost captures the astounding magnetism and ferocity of their live show. \"Selling Candy\" is the perfect example. It's a small snapshot of childhood complete with nostalgic references to summertime hot dogs and wandering the city but set to an explosive, stadium-ready fuzzed-out arrangement. Elsewhere, songs like the dystopian dance rocker \"The Limit\" further stretch their already dynamic palette.\n\nFantasize Your Ghost encapsulates the thrilling and sometimes terrifying joy of moving forward even if you don't know where you're going. It's an album that asks necessary questions: When life demands a crossroads, what version of yourself are you going to pursue? What part of yourself will you feed and let flourish and what do you have to let go of? When they sing, \"Just walk out the door and / Don\u2019t tell them goodbye\" it's drastic but also exhilaratingly hopeful. This is a record of strength, of best friends believing in each other. Unapologetic and brave, Ohmme are ready to figure it all out together.", "otherInfo": "Ohmme live on Dr Martens Instagram - Stay In Series #drmartenspresents\n\n5/21 at 2pm PST/4pm CT"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luisana Lopilato ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emily Rose Official ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9378857.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Pop, Country, Alt-country, Americana", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A voice reminiscent of Emmy Lou, with the honesty of Linda Ronstadt, Emily Rose invites you in with every line.\nShe\u2019s a jangly, retro country singer, focusing on the true grit of the songs she believes in.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "T.

Hot out of the gate, the listener is hit with powerful electric guitar riffs backed by a driving drum beat and gritty bass tones.\n\nThe story of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is based on a conversation between a young aspiring artist and an old man at a bar.

Born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, CA, Perry grew up in a Christian household as the daughter of two pastors. Though she was not allowed to listen to secular music as a child, Perry later found herself captivated by Alanis Morissette and Freddie Mercury, having discovered Queen's music during a slumber party. Religious music remained at the forefront, however, and Perry released a self-titled Christian album in 2001 under the name Katy Hudson. She would later abandon the genre in favor of a pop career. At age 17, the burgeoning songwriter began working with hitmaker Glen Ballard, who had produced and co-written Alanis Morissette's chart-topping Jagged Little Pill in 1995. Several years later, she teamed up with the Matrix, a Grammy-nominated production/songwriting team whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included collaborations with Avril Lavigne, Shakira, and Korn. The Matrix had plans to record their own album, with Perry serving as one of the group's two singers. The project was ultimately shelved, but not before Perry appeared in a 2004 write-up by Blender magazine, who hailed her as \"The Next Big Thing!\" With the Matrix's unreleased album sitting in the vaults at Sony Records, Perry went back to the drawing board and ultimately signed with Columbia in 2007. Her debut single, \"UR So Gay,\" generated some online buzz with its mischievous lyrics and accompanying music video, and Perry's audience grew accordingly. In 2008 her debut album, One of the Boys, was released, and she helped promote it by joining the summer's Warped Tour and appearing in an episode of The Young and the Restless. ~ Andrew Leahey & Jason Birchmeier, All Music Guide", "otherInfo": "Special at-home performance"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "James Taylor, Jr. ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10171824.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "American Pop, Christmas, Pop, Acoustic, Americana, Soul, Holiday, Easy Listening, Easy Pop", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cGREAT VOICE AND SONGS...AMAZING SINGER!!

After 12 years of playing as many as 300 shows each year, Rev. Peyton, the world\u2019s foremost country blues finger-style picker, along with the biggest little band in the country has pieced together one of the most dedicated followings out there. This following is sure to eat up the bands latest offering, Poor Until Payday, (the second on their own Family Owned Records label through hip Nashville indie Thirty Tigers) out October 5th, a country blues record that was made the right way \u2014 two feet on the ground and both hands getting dirty.\n\nWith all the power of a freight train, the Big Damn Band is known for its live shows. Rev. Peyton delivers guitar pyrotechnics the old fashioned way \u2014 ten fingers, a 6 string and an amp cranked at full tilt. In the country blues style, he plays the bass with his thumb, while picking the lead with his fingers at the same time. When he lifts the guitar behind his head to play there's nothing but skill and 16 gauge nickel strings to make the soundscoming out of the speakers.\n\nBeside him on stage are just two other people. His wife, \u201cWashboard\u201d Breezy Peyton playing with all the nuance and percussive power of a New Orleans drum line, and keeping the train moving is Max Senteney on a lean drum kit including a 5 gallon maple syrup bucket. Together they play Peyton's wildman country blues that's as much ZZ Top as it is Bukka White.\n\nOn Poor Until Payday Peyton wanted a sound as live and electric as the records made in the heyday of 45 rpm blues classics from Chess, Stax and Sun Records. Playing his\nbeloved custom-made National steel resonator, a 1949 Harmony Archtop, a 1954 Supro Dual Tone and a 1955 Kay Speed Demon through a 1949 Supro amp, Rev wanted to restore the \u201cwarmth, pops and hisses\u201d mostly eliminated by modern-day compression. The band played in a room together with minimal micing (using only the best classic pieces they could get) with the main effect being tape saturation.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe result is an album that is direct, soulful and demands to be played loud.\n\nThe themes of songs like the title track, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Steal My Shine\u201d and \u201cI Suffer I Get Tougher\u201d offer the antidote to today\u2019s hard times by touting \u201cperseverance, inspiration and hope\u2026 being your authentic self despite everything lined against you, a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d With a vocal style reflecting both the soulfulness and bite of his idols, Rev has added world-class singer to his already-renowned skills as a finger-pickin\u2019 guitar\nphenom. Breezy and Max also contribute background vocals to most of the songs, with \u201cThe Miss Elizabeth of Country Blues\u201d actually taking the spotlight with a sultry call-and- response showcase on \u201cDirty Swerve,\u201d in which she also contributed to the writing.\n\nPeyton's blues pedigree is well established. Woodshedding since he was 12, Peyton has kept alive a tradition of finger picking pioneered by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt. However, Peyton plays with the energy and attitude of a Howlin' Wolf. Indeed if it has strings he can play it whether that's a custom-built National, a cigarbox, an axe or even a shotgun (seriously, Google it.).\n\nHe's done his homework and been given the blessing of the gatekeepers of the tradition \u2014 even befriending and touring with some of the last of the great Delta Blues and Hill Country blues legends like David \u201cHoneyboy\u201d Edwards, T-Model Ford (whose grandson calls him Unk), and Robert Belfour.\n\nRev and Breezy make their home in rural southern Indiana near the adopted home of bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, among national parks and forests in what began as an artist\u2019s colony. \u201cMost of the people here can both paint a picture and skin a deer,\u201d laughs Breezy.\n\nTheres nothing dusty or sentimental about Peyton's music, though. Theres no songs about picking cotton. They aren't a museum piece. The Big Damn Band have taken nearly a century of blues songsmanship and crafted a thing all their own. There is not a single act out there that sounds like this.\n\nThe Big Damn Band make friends and fans every place they go \u2014 and there are few places they haven't been, having performed in 37 countries. After Poor Until Payday, the only people who won't be on the big damn bandwagon will be people who haven't heard or aren't paying attention.\n\nThis is real, from the heart, handmade music made by people, for people who don\u2019t have time for BS.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SHEL ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10300511.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Pop, Alternative, Folk", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When the gatekeepers of the music world tried to contain the superpowers of four creative sisters - walls fell.

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Townes (born January 22, 1965 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), also known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, is an American hip hop and R&B record producer and turntablist. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia where he is enshrined in the school's \"Wall of Fame\".\n\nHistory\n\nWhen he was growing up, he found that listening to his parents was unbearable. He got a job as a newspaper boy at age 7 to support his family. Once he grew up, he developed a reputation and following as a school and block party DJ extraordinaire, Jazzy Jeff was the feature of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. As a duo, they had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy ever presented in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand. When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Jazzy Jeff played a recurring character named \"Jazz\", Smith's best friend on the show. The two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back/snap with both characters saying \"Pssh!\").\n\nJazz' trademarks include being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), screaming as he went flying out the front door. This was referenced in the song \"N.Y, N.Y.\" by Lloyd Banks from his second album Rotten Apple, with the lyric \"I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff\". [1]\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff is not to be confused with Jeffrey Myree from the earlier hip hop group Funky Four Plus One, which in fact filed and won a lawsuit over the name Jazzy Jeff against Jeff Townes and Jive records when they signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. After DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&B, soul, and neo soul record producer, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Jill Scott and Musiq. Even though he separated from Will Smith as music partners, they are still best friends and still occasionally work together. Some songs by Will Smith were produced by Jeff Townes (Ex. Here He Comes), and he has performed on some songs by Will Smith such as \"So Fresh\" and \"Potnas\". In addition, he appears in several of Smith's music videos such as \"Will2K\", \"Freakin' It\", and \"Party Starter\". On some occasions, he makes appearances with Smith on live concerts, producing DJ scratches.\n\nHe, along with DJ Cash Money, is credited with making the transform scratch famous.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. In the past, Will has performed on concerts with DJ Jazzy Jeff for the scratches. Moreover, Will acknowledges him in his music like \"Comin' To The Stage\" from the album Lost & Found or \"Potnas\" in his album Willennium.\n\nHis 2007 release TROTM (The Return of the Magnificent) is a classic work which returns to the roots of hip-hop with a neo-soul mixture included. This album featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Crakk (a remake of Brand New Funk), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in the video DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Fest directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest and they reveal that they are working on an album together called \"I'm the DJ, I'm the Rapper\".\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo work as DJ Jazzy Jeff\n\n* Unreleased album from Sony Records (1998)\n* One cut in Battle of DJs\n* The Magnificent (2002)\n* Soulheaven Presents Jazzy Jeff in the House (2004)\n* The Soul Mixtape Groovin' Records USA (2005)\n* Hip-Hop Forever II Rapster Records (2004)\n* Hip-Hop Forever III BBE Records (2006)\n* The Return of The Magnificent EP (2007)\n* The Return of the Magnificent (2007)\n* The Return of Hip Hop EP (2007)\n\n\nAs DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince\n\n* Rock the House (1987) #83 US (Gold)\n* He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper (1988) #4 US (3x Platinum)\n* And in This Corner\u2026 (1989) #39 US (Gold)\n* Homebase (1991) #12 US (Platinum)\n* Code Red (1993) #64 US (Gold)\n* Greatest Hits (1998) #144 US, #20 UK\n* Before The Willennium (1999)\n* The Very Best of D.J.

He has worked with virtually all of the great musicians of modern popular music as well as entering into new relationships with the best of the latest generation of artists.\n\nStarting his career as a teenager on the streets of Philadelphia, he quickly formed creative affiliations with such artists as Smokey Robinson, the Temptations and many other top soul singers of the \u201860s. He began his recording career with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, working as both an artist and session musician.\n\nIn 1972, he formed a partnership with childhood friend John Oates and embarked on a 30-odd year creative journey. In addition to his work with Oates, he has made music as a solo artist, first recording with Robert Fripp in the late \u201870s, producing the much-acclaimed Sacred Songs as well as working on Fripp\u2019s critically praised Exposure.\n\nFrom the mid-\u201970s to the mid-\u201980s, Daryl and John would score six #1 singles, including \u201cRich Girl\u201d (also #1 R&B), \u201cKiss on My List,\u201d \u201cPrivate Eyes,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Go For That (No Can Do) (also #1 R&B), \u201cManeater\u201d and \u201cOut of Touch\u201d from their six consecutive multi-platinum albums\u2014\u201976\u2019s Bigger Than Both of Us, \u201980\u2019s Voices, \u201981\u2019s Private Eyes, \u201882\u2019s H2O, \u201883\u2019s Rock N Soul, Part I and \u201884\u2019s Big Bam Boom.

In 1986, Daryl made an album with Dave Stewart, Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine, which spawned two top ten hits. By 1987, the R.I.A.A. recognized Daryl Hall and John Oates as the NUMBER-ONE SELLING DUO in music history, a record they still hold today. Daryl has recorded such solo works as Soul Alone in 1993 and Can\u2019t Stop Dreaming in 2003, both of which were well received with international critical acclaim.\n\nIn November of 2007 Daryl created his latest project: a monthly web series, Live from Daryl\u2019s House (http://www.livefromdarylshouse.com). The show recently won the 2010 WEBBY Award in the Variety Category.\n\nPast episodes of Live from Daryl\u2019s House have featured a mix of well-known performers like Train, Rob Thomas, Smokey Robinson, The Doors\u2019 Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek, Nick Lowe, K.T.

Timeless and timely, it's a classic sound with every word sang from the heart, driven forward by a mix of southern storytelling, Bible Belt twang, and Owens' big, booming baritone.\n\nFresh out of the studio, Owens has just finished recording his latest album due to release at year\u2019s end. He traveled to Texas for this project to record in The Panhandle House Studio enlisting the talents of JT Corenflos | Electric Guitar ( Alan Jackson, George Jones, Charley Pride, George Strait), Mitchell Smithey | Steele Guitar (Ray Price, Lee Ann Rimes, TG Sheppard, Gary Stuart), Dale Morris Jr. | Fiddle (Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Ray Price, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt), Kerry Huckaba | Bass Guitar (The Hansons, The White River Band), Jay Brown | Piano (Canyon, Ty Herndon), and Andrew Raley | Drums (Deryl Dodd). Together, they captured a sound filled with fiddle, pedal steel and all the hallmarks of classic country music. Ten of the eleven tracks are penned by veteran writer Galen Griffin (Luke Bryan, Joe Diffie, Craig Morgan, Clay Walker) and magically Engineered and Produced by Nick \u201cAce\u201d Lutz (David Alan Coe, Ty Herndon, Little Texas, Ronnie Milsap, Kellie Pickler). This is an album filled with music intended to take the listener back to an earlier era in Country Music reminiscent of a simpler time. Owens shines brightly delivering each song with the same supersized voice that once shook the pews of his hometown church as the musicians expertly lay the sounds of Dance Halls long gone.\n\nLong before he hand-built his career in the honky-tonks and country clubs of the southeast, Owens grew up in rural Alabama. In many ways, it was a classic American upbringing, filled with family, faith, and music. Owens shines a light on those old-school values with his debut album Where I\u2019m Coming From and his newest release It\u2019s A Southern Thing, working closely with a roster of country music's top songwriters \u2014 including Bob Diperio, Greg Barnhill, Tony Stampley, Wynn Varble, Brian Callihan and Trent Willmon \u2014 for his most upbeat collection of songs to date.\n\n\"Like a lot of my favorite country singers, I grew up singing Gospel music,\" says Owens, who grew up listening to artists like Randy Travis and Keith Whitley. \"I grew up the same way, and I've stayed true to my Traditional Country roots. I'm still singing about going to church, eating fried chicken, and keeping it country. Why wouldn't I? Once you start trying to be something you're not, that's when you lose track of where you're headed.\"\n\nLongtime country music journalist Robert K. Oermann agrees, pointing to Owens' traditional approach as his strongest weapon. \"I like to think that there are cycles in [country] music,\" Oermann explains. \"Usually, the pendulum swings out and the Pop-Country people bring in a whole lot of new listeners, and then the new listeners discover real Country music. Then there's usually a swing back to more traditional styles. I hope we're on the cusp of that\u2026 and if we are, Shane is perfectly positioned.\"\nA self-made road warrior who was recently named \"Independent Artist of the Year\" by MusicRow Reveals 2018 Country Breakout Awards, Owens continues to maintain an active schedule of listening room and honky tonk shows along with festival appearances. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut in 2017. He also appeared at summertime events like CMA Music Festival and Jamboree In the Hills, both of which were voted as the top two American country music festivals of the year. Cracker Barrel has picked Owens' music to appear in several of the store's exclusive releases, including Country Faith America and Country Faith Love Songs, while Netflix included his song \"Country Never Goes Out of Style\" in the popular series The Ranch. No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends.

Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft.

She\u2019ll be a featured artist at the \u201cSongwriters Island Showcase\u201d in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in 2020, and will be opening once again for Delta Rae and David Cook (Summer Tour 2020). In the interim she\u2019s logged countless hours on the road, performing at venues and house concerts across the US, as well as an international tour through Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things will be available on iTunes and Spotify worldwide in Summer of 2020.

Says Brent, \"It\u2019s a song about dancing like everyone is watching, and you don\u2019t give a damn.\"\n\nBlurring the lines between boisterous rock, R&B, and contemplative folk, Brent\u2019s infectious voice and knack for melody seem to swing effortlessly from quavering intimacy to a soulful roar as they soar atop his exuberant, explosive arrangements.\n\nGrowing up, Cowles first discovered the power of his voice singing hymns at his father\u2019s church in Colorado Springs. Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life. The Denver Post raved that the group created \u201csome of the most exciting original music in Colorado,\u201d while Westword proclaimed that their live show was a \u201cclinic in roots rock mixed with old-school swing and blues,\u201d and Seattle NPR station KEXP hailed \u201cCowles\u2019 Otis Redding and Sam Cooke inspired vocals.\u201d The band released two albums and toured nationally before they called it quits and amicably went their separate ways.\n\nThe parting was a necessary but difficult one for Cowles. In the ensuing months and years, he would find himself alone more than ever before, at one point living out of his Chevy Tahoe just to make ends meet. But rather than break him, the experience only strengthened his resolve. \"High to Low\u201d gives the listener a real sense of Brent\u2019s current mood. His songs are more evolved yet simpler, his lyrics are stronger yet fragile. He hopes you love it, live it and get down with it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Johnson Crook ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9191293.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Alternative Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "What the quartet\u2014Noel Johnson (rhythm guitars/vocals), brothers Nathan (lead guitar/vocals) and Trevor Crook (drums/vocals) and Jared Craig (bass/vocals)\u2014share is a love of pure, honest music stemming from their small-town backgrounds.

It was in that spirit that Matt Maher birthed his latest album, Saints and Sinners (Essential/Sony).\n\nThe garage-turned-studio behind Maher\u2019s home became a haven of reflection as he tirelessly transformed it into a creative songwriting space. \u201cEvery day, I\u2019d go out there and dream a bit and ask, \u2018God, what do you want to build here?\u2019\u201d Maher recalls. \u201cI thought a lot about the nature of what it means to build something, and I didn\u2019t have a clear sense of where I was headed. I found myself in a place of unknowing,\u201d Maher says. \u201cSo I naturally started gravitating toward writings and quotes from people having experienced the tension between certainty and mystery.\u201d He began saving these prayers, quotes and excerpts while also studying prophetic voices who significantly impacted the history of the church - believers who wrestled with matters of faith, who challenged the status quo and left marked legacies.\n\nAmidst creativity unfolding, the record-making process began, unbeknownst to Maher, when he stepped into the studio to record a song based on the timeless Bill Gaither hymn \u201cBecause He Lives.\u201d Initially, he was recording the song for a one-off compilation project, but Maher\u2019s label heard the demo and immediately deemed it his next radio single. \u201cAll of a sudden, it was like, \u2018You\u2019re making a record,\u2019 and what\u2019s funny is my first response was, \u2018But I don\u2019t have any songs,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe more I thought about it, I realized I had already begun the writing process for all these songs, based on all these people I had been studying. I just wasn\u2019t aware of how beautifully it was starting to come together.\u201d \u201cBecause He Lives (Amen)\u201d became the catalyst to initiate an entire chain of songwriting sessions based on a short list of difference makers.\n\nMaher brought together a host of talented songwriters among who were Thad Cockrell (Leagues), Jon Foreman (Switchfoot), Bo and Bear Rinehart (NEEDTOBREATHE), Jason Ingram and several others for the project.\n\nWith songs loosely crafted and ready for the studio, Maher collaborated with longtime friend and producer Paul Moak (Third Day, Mat Kearney) to bring to life the themes of unity and the struggle of living in the \u201cin-between.\u201d This duality was not only explored lyrically but also sonically as the two men creatively experimented in-studio on \u201cSaints and Sinners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were looking at the idea of the tension between the saint and the sinner - of looking at two contrasting things, and incorporating that into the production of the music. For example, you take an imperfect being, who generates analog sound waves, and they get recorded into a computer that turns them into digital information. You can create so much within a computer that there is a fine line of tension between it sounding perfect versus human, so we tried to arrive at a reconciliation between the two,\u201d Maher explains.\n\nThe lives and work of other influencers became the blueprint for additional cuts, like the album\u2019s driving first track, \u201cFuture Not My Own,\u201d which is based on a prayer inspired by martyr Oscar Romero. \u201cThis prayer really brings to light that we\u2019re announcing a kingdom that\u2019s here, that\u2019s coming, and that\u2019s being built, that we won\u2019t see the finish of. That\u2019s a huge aspect of being a part of the Church, the body of Christ.\u201d\n\nMaher is an outspoken champion of unity and collaboration, not just amongst Christians on a level of faith but also on a civic level,\u201d he says. Perhaps the most outspoken example of this desire is the gospel-tinged \u201cSons and Daughters.\u201d Although the song was written before the Ferguson incident made headlines, the timely track is an ode to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Maher\u2019s attempt to speak into racial reconciliation. \u201cGod used the church in the \u201960s to inspire a nation for healing. Most people don\u2019t think about the fact that a lot of people in the civil rights movement initially were pastors. Faith was the thing that motivated people toward eradicating injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cSons and Daughters\u201d is a special song, and I hope it will play a part in inspiring more Christian leaders toward re-engagement in the issue of civil rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirelight\u201d is inspired by the ministry of Mother Teresa. Maher\u2019s inspiration for the idea of a firelight comes from her saying, \u201cIf I ever become a saint - I will surely be one of \u2018darkness. I will continually be absent from heaven - to light the light of those in darkness on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything Is Grace\u201d is based on a quote by St. Therese of Lisieux out of \u201cHer Last Conversations\u201d that reads, \u201cEverything is a grace, everything is the direct effect of our father's love - difficulties, contradictions, humiliations, all the soul's miseries, her burdens, her needs - everything, because through them, she learns humility, realizes her weakness. Everything is a grace because everything is God's gift. Whatever be the character of life or its unexpected events - to the heart that loves, all is well.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest\u201d sets Psalm 23 to music and features the vocal harmonies of The Vespers. This song, in particular, came at a time when Maher\u2019s grandmother\u2019s health was failing, and the acoustic-driven track proved to be a source of encouragement for his family.\n\nSince his 2008 major label debut, Maher has become a staple in the artistic and songwriting community. A five time-GRAMMY\u00ae nominee, he has garnered multiple radio successes writing and recording songs like \u201cLord, I Need You,\u201d \u201cHold Us Together,\u201d \u201cChrist Is Risen,\u201d \u201cAll The People Said Amen\u201d and \u201cYour Grace Is Enough.\u201d Maher has penned songs recorded by Chris Tomlin, Crowder, Third Day, Matt Redman, Hillsong, Passion and Meredith Andrews, among others. Maher continues to perform and speak as a part of global high-profile events, including the upcoming World Meeting of Families, marking Pope Francis\u2019 first visit to the US this year. In 2013, Maher performed on stage with Pope Francis in front of more than 3 million people at World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro. Maher and his team are already in the planning stages of participating in World Youth Day 2016 taking place in the summer of 2016 in Krakow, Poland.\n\nMaher has found that while we all come from different backgrounds, amass a range of experiences and even harbor conflicting opinions, the one thing that always binds us together is our humanity. \u201cIt\u2019s the sinful side of me that helps me identify with other broken people and not see myself as better. Christianity doesn\u2019t make me better than anybody else,\u201d he contends. \u201cThe process of being transformed is sometimes a really messy process. When you can remember how far off you were when God found you, your own conversion stands as a testimony to God and mercy, but it also gives you a way to relate to other people.\u201d After all, we were created by a loving God who designed us for a greater purpose. We are each on the pilgrimage of searching out that purpose, being transformed, saints and sinners.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fat Joe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7303966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Rap, Hip-hop, Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fat Joe (born Joseph Cartagena on August 19, 1970) is an American rapper.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bleeker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9625492.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Alternative", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bleeker are steadily building a rock solid name for themselves in their native Canada.

The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama/Avi & Celia) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center. From 2013-16, Salloway toured the globe with Bombino, the Tuareg guitar hero from Niger, Africa. While on the journey and since returning, Salloway wrote the material on the band\u2019s latest album, Strike the Match (Sand & Gold Records).\n\nSalloway has been bringing these songs to life with the Wylder Family, a group of dear friends and musical kindred spirits. In between shows, the band spent ten days recording at Eyeland Studio in the Columbus Theatre, home of The Low Anthem. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert: think Andrew Bird meets Ali Farka Toure, Pete Seeger and Talking Heads. Strike the Match expands on American musical traditions, building a bridge to their African roots and coloring the songs with experimental art-rock textures: gilded string lines, synthesizers, and angular guitars. Mother Earth is at its center, surrounded by stories of love, conflict, change and dreams.\n\nSalloway shares, \u201cThis album is a reflection of the world we\u2019ve been born into, one filled with supernatural beauty and incomprehensible struggle. My social and environmental activism work has taken me to territories that have been colonized and occupied in the Middle East, North and West Africa, the South Pacific and Standing Rock, here at home. I have experienced the creative spirit rise up in the face of darkness and adversity and it is the most life-affirming feeling I have witnessed. This record has become the artifact at the intersection of these moving events in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Strike the Match, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most pressing questions of our time. How can we reorient ourselves to nature as a source of strength for resistance to the forces that seek to destroy and profit from it? How can we use music to move beyond capitalism and nationalism to a global society for the benefit of the earth and all living beings? How can we reconcile our painful history with hope and optimism for the future? The album calls the listener to engage with these questions and illuminates the path towards participating in the creation of a more just and sustainable world.\n\nThe band is named after Salloway\u2019s grandmother, Wilma \u201cBillie\u201d Hotaling.\u201d She was a prolific painter, author, musician, and educator. Billie wrote Count the Stars Through the Cracks, a harrowing historical fiction novel about a young brother and sister\u2019s escape from the Antebellum South along the Underground Railroad. Billie\u2019s writing was raw and fearless and her book delivered a powerful narrative about America\u2019s hard truths and the long journey to freedom. \u201cMy grandma Billie led by example, showing me what creativity looks like and how critical art can be as a form of love and resistance. She is part of me and part of the Wylder family,\u201d Salloway reflects.\n\n\u201cRaised in a progressive home and taught to play by Pete and John Seeger, activism is a constant in Avi Salloway\u2019s life and art. During the past decade, he\u2019s performed in world crisis spots, from the Palestinian territories to Standing Rock, always delivering a message of music\u2019s power to heal and bring change.\u201d \u2013The Hippo\n\n\"Engaging mash-up of various strains of American folk and rock and Tuareg desert blues.\" \u2013The Boston Globe", "otherInfo": "Tune in Thursday, May 21 to catch Avi live on the ZenBarn facebook page.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Harvest Sons ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10387660.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop, Americana, Rock", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "...a Rust Belt frame of mind bleeds into Harvest Sons' synthesis of Americana and Folk infused Indie Rock.

That was mesmerizing to me. Alanis was all about raw, unapologetic emotion and power, and her lyrics were very dynamic while still retaining introspection.\"\n\nIn 2018, Crowe won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest for her song \"Breaking Things,\" which was co-written and co-produced with her partner and first songwriting collaborator Josh Anderson; a year later, she released her debut album Symptoms, the result of two and a half years of work with Anderson in Los Angeles on songs she'd originally written in her bedroom. \"It was my first chapter as a writer, producer, and artist,\" she states while discussing the album's origins. \"It was such a journey to have people around me and a team who could help guide me in this city.\"\n\nA deeply felt and expressive pop album, Symptoms was inspired by Lady Gaga's own approach to production and songwriting: \"She's a powerhouse performer. A lot of my production is inspired by her, along with songwriters like Sia and Taylor Swift\u2014strong women that are powerful, dynamic, and cathartic above all else.\"\n\nSymptoms' title track\u2014as well as the album as a whole\u2014draws from an abusive experience that took place before moving to the West Coast. \"After I went through that experience, my body went into shock and I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety,\" she recalls. \"It was about telling myself that everything was going to be okay\u2014and a musical diary that revealed the ways I was coping with what I'd been through.\"\n\nThe transformative \u201cChess Game,\u201d co-written by Kailey Shaffer, zeroes in on the struggles that young women in the music industry often face, as well as how to transcend and evolve amidst such struggles. As young women in our industry, we felt like we were tired of playing everyone else\u2019s games,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were inspired to write something uplifting\u2014an infectiously driven and empowering anthem in the face of adversity. The symbolism of the lyrics represents transformation, realizing your inner strength and having the courage to take back and own your true power.\u201d The song was an anthem and debuted in the Billboard Dance Charts.\n\n\"Each song is a different piece of a puzzle\u2014a symptom of who I am,\" Crowe continues. \"I took my traumatic experiences and turned them into these fun pop songs to help me get through what I've experienced.\" The latest single from Symptoms, \"Sky Is Falling,\" is particularly close to Crowe's heart; the epic, wide-open ballad finds her drawing from the pain and perseverance of her father's passing. \"It's my most personal song\u2014it encompasses all the things at the core of what I've gone through,\" she explains. I never had the chance to get any closure with him about what had happened to me, and I never got to say goodbye. All my anxiety turned into depression when he died. Because he studied the stars, the title itself is a double meaning. My world was crashing down around me, but I also wanted to make sure the song was uplifting and hopeful.\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for the single is next up, and in Crowe's words, the space-themed clip focuses on \"Finding a connection with that feeling after you experience loss\u2014with that person who may not even be there in the physical form anymore.\" What's next?

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit 3rd and Lindsley, Nashville"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Julian Taylor ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "American Highways: Livestream Music from the Quarantine: https://www.facebook.com/americanahighways.org"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dessa ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10322237.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Rap, Hip Hop, Pop, Vocal, Songwriter", "Time": "12:45 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer, rapper, and writer Dessa has made a career of bucking genres and defying expectations\u2014her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a musician includes performances at Lollapalooza and Glastonbury, co-compositions for 100-voice choir, performances with the Minnesota Orchestra, and a top-200 entry on the Billboard charts for her album Parts of Speech.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Just to make sure you are sat up and paying attention then \u2018Crazy\u2019 muscles in, it\u2019s a big-riffed stomper that smashes the door down making it another great opening to a Saints\u2019 release.\u201d - The Rock Pit (Australia)\n\n\u201cTake advantage of this now.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jerry Joseph ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7249633.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Rock And Roll, Songwriter, Singer, Folk, Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Joseph is a prolific and accomplished songwriter, writing hits for Widespread Panic and releasing 30 albums in his 30+ year career; as a solo artist, with the Jackmormons, supergroup Stockholm Syndrome, his burning two-piece The Denmark Veseys, or originally, with his beloved 80s cult band, Little Women.\n\nJoseph is also a relentless live performer, playing over 150 shows a year across the globe.

Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones. In 2006, Johnson became a member of The Shins, but remains committed to the Fruit Bats.
