This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Among its many awesomely quirky attractions (beyond dope AF lobster rolls, of course), the mini-metropolis boasts the International Cryptozoology Museum and even served as the site of the nation\u2019s first chewing gum factory. Suffice it to say, the town possesses all kinds of character and charm. It also makes perfect sense as HQ for Weakened Friends. Three alternative rock wiseasses and snack food connoisseurs, the trio\u2014Sonia Sturino [vocals, guitar], Annie Hoffman [bass], and Cam Jones [drums]\u2014first congregated in their adopted hometown during 2014. Sonia had recently relocated from Toronto and holed up in a house with Cam and a bunch of other dudes before witnessing Annie play live and asking her to join the band. As they released two independent EPs, Gloomy Tunes and Crushed, they stirred up a palpable buzz (between consuming sour spaghetti and causing trouble). Gigs followed with everyone from CHVRCHES and Silversun Pickups to Beach Slang and Juliana Hatfield as they made their 2017 debut at SXSW and earned praise from Vanyaland, CBS, If It\u2019s Too Loud, and many more. A wiry, whimsical, and wild fusion of disarmingly pop hooks and fuzzed-out riffery that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the Reality Bites soundtrack or in a modern Brooklyn bar fueled this quiet rise. \u201cIf something is ear catching and interesting, I\u2019m drawn to it,\u201d says Sturino. \u201cI love pop hooks, but I have this truly weird and shaky voice. I started to embrace that, and I think people connect to the sound.\u201d For the uninitiated, they\u2019ll definitely connect to the group\u2019s 2017 single \u201cHate Mail\u201d featuring J Mascis. On the track, a buzz of feedback slips into melodic guitar and an unshakable rhythm as the frontwoman captivates with the confessionally catchy refrain, \u201cI hate everything you\u2019re saying, get away from me. I hate everything we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a waste of me.\u201d It\u2019s the perfect backdrop for an epic Mascis cameo. \u201cIt\u2019s about when I was miserable in this other band,\u201d recalls Sturino. \u201cThis is the most important thing to me. I don\u2019t live comfortably. I don\u2019t have a lot of money. I don\u2019t have a lot of free time, because I\u2019m putting all of my effort, passion, and self into music. So, it has to be the right situation. At the time, I just wasn\u2019t working with the right team. The song is about those corrosive relationships with emotionally abusive assholes. J is a guitar god for indie rock. He\u2019s an obvious inspiration, and he killed it.\u201d \u201cHate Mail\u201d hints at a lot more to come from Weakened Friends. For Sturino, the band brings everything full circle. In tow with her best friend Cam and wife Annie, she encodes a powerful message in the lyrics. \u201cA lot of times, you hear expressions like, \u2018Find your happy\u2019,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI think you should find yourself. Our music is about self-awareness and finding that. Sometimes, you\u2019re having a shitty day. It can be hard, and that\u2019s beautiful in its own way. In the North American mentality, if you\u2019re depressed or sad, you have to just get rid of it. This is less about getting rid of that feeling and finding those things causing the feeling and dealing with them. It\u2019s self-awareness, believing in yourself, finding yourself, and defining how you feel. That\u2019s what this band is to me.\u201d We're three tall young adults making some songs and eating some snacks.

Lubbock, Texas is an unlikely environment for a boy to dream of being a jazz musician. Fortunately, Tom had a direct link to this creative art form through his dad, James (\"J.T.\") Braxton.\n\nAfter graduating valedictorian from high school, Tom attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas on track and music scholarships. \u201cI love to run, and the 200, 400, and 1600-meter relay were my events.\u201d During his college years, Braxton formed the jazz fusion band \u201cNo Compromise\u201d which toured the southwest and opened concerts for Joe Sample, Stanley Clarke, George Howard, and many others. The band performed many of Tom\u2019s original compositions which helped to fine-tune his writing style.\n\nAs his college years came to a close, the band fizzled out and Tom launched a solo career. His first act of business was to join forces with keyboardist and producer Bernard Wright to release his solo debut, Your Move. \u201cThe highlight of my first release was having the opportunity to record a duet with long-time friend Kirk Whalum on the song \u201cPeacemaker.\u201d Bernard Wright not only produced Braxton\u2019s first CD, but was instrumental in connecting him to a gifted musician/producer who would elevate Tom to the national touring circuit. \u201cI have to credit Bernard Wright with getting me the gig with Wayman Tisdale. \u2018Nard was in Sacramento working with Wayman on some projects. Tisdale told \u2018Nard that he was starting a band and my name came up. I flew to Sacramento and played with Wayman at the Red Lion Hotel where we opened a concert for the Yellowjackets. I\u2019ll never forget it . . . it was 1992!! Except for a few years off during the births of my sons, I\u2019ve been playing with Wayman ever since.\u201d\n\nBraxton\u2019s second album, Katallasso, mixed memorable, lite-funk melodies with some unique production touches. In April 1998, the CD was released nationally on Positive Music Records and featured the talents of Kirk Whalum, Paul Jackson Jr., Bill Maxwell, and Bill Cantos. For Tom\u2019s third album, he took a brief departure from mainstream smooth jazz and in 1999 released an instrumental praise and worship CD entitled Face to Face. Two years later, he followed it up with the release of Comfort and Joy, a Christmas album that presented Braxton\u2019s fresh arrangements of traditional and contemporary holiday favorites. His fifth release, Bounce, was produced by Wayman Tisdale for Dave Koz\u2019s label, Rendezvous Entertainment. \u201cWayman approached me with the idea of doing a project together,\u201d recalls Braxton. \u201cI was very excited and the creative juices began to flow. We had a lot of fun in the studio playing with grooves and melodies and the CD, Bounce, was born.\u201d In 2007 the CD Imagine This was released.\n\nTom has shared the stage with many well-known artists including Luther Vandross, Phillip Bailey, Kirk Whalum, Jonathan Butler, Dave Koz, George Duke, Jeff Golub, Marcus Miller, and Paul Brown. Tom has opened concerts for numerous jazz greats including Dave Brubeck, Cab Calloway, Spyro Gyra, Najee, Rippingtons, David Benoit, Norman Brown, Pieces of a Dream, Boney James, Michael Franks, and The Crusaders.\n\nOver the years, Braxton has been featured in several publications including JAZZIZ, Smooth Jazz News, and the international Italian music magazine, New Sounds. He has also appeared on CBS\u2019s The Saturday Early Show, B.E.T.\u2019s Jazz Central, TBS, TNT, ESPN, CNN, NBC\u2019s Inside Stuff, Positively Texas, Good Morning Texas, and the Fox Network\u2019s Good Day Dallas.\n\nSeasoned with experience and gifted with a fresh sound that has widespread appeal, Tom Braxton is destined to be a key player in the music industry in the 21st century.\n\nTom Braxton's Official site: www.tombraxton.com\nTom Braxton's My Space site: www.myspace.com/tombraxton", "otherInfo": "Full Food and Bar Menu Available in all sectionsThis versatile instrumentalist and gifted composer is a seasoned performer who has the amazing ability to grab the heart-strings of the audience within the first few minutes of his show; engage them with his exceptional skill, wit, and charm; and leave them astounded, clapping, and on their feet screaming for more!

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "230 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Claudia Russell", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/313021.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.822691, 38.40115], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Hop Monk Sebastopol", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Scott Law", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9809743.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: AMERICANA-BLUEGRASS-ROCK N ROLL", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "SCOTT LAW\nwww.scottlawmusic.com\nScott Law may have been born in Southern California but his music pulls together traditions from every corner of the country.\n\nMultifaceted artist Scott Law is an accomplished guitar master, singer-songwriter and recording artist operating at the very highest level of his craft.

Kenneth\u2019s musical styling and dynamic live performances also attracted the attention of some of his mentors like Lucinda Williams, Billy Gibbons and current bandmate Steve Ferrone of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Since 2013, he spent two years touring with multi-Grammy winner Lucinda Williams, who describes the sound of the live band as \u201csomewhere between Lynyrd Skynyrd and Drive-By Truckers\u201d. He has also opened for ZZ Top, Steve Winwood, and Blackberry Smoke. Whether in intimate Honky Tonks or stately, sold-out theaters, Kenneth and the live band continue to captivate audiences with powerful, resonating guitar tones and a tight rhythm section.\n\nKenneth\u2019s sixth studio album \u2018With Lions,\u2019 released May 19th 2017, includes 11 songs all written by Kenneth and pays tribute to his mentors as well as his musically rich and culturally significant Southern heritage. The single \u201cYou\u2019re Not Mine\u201d is an edgy anthem with heavy-hitting guitar solos and powerful vocals. \u201cBeautiful Storm\u201d is an emotionally evocative track that showcases Kenneth\u2019s spell-binding competency with a slide.\n\nRock \u2018n\u2019 roll royalty Steve Ferrone (Drums, Tambourine, Shakers) and Scott Thurston (Keyboards, Piano) of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers don\u2019t just lend their talents for the album but, Ferrone sits behind the drum kit when he\u2019s not touring with Tom Petty. Kenneth and Steve met a couple of years ago at a gathering thrown by a mutual pal. Not long after, he needed a drummer for a Hollywood gig and Steve sat in with the band. He has worked with Kenneth to hone the sound and helped him the right players. And as they say, the rest is history. Handpicked by Steve, drummer Chris Cano plays with the KBB when Ferrone is on the road with the Heartbreakers. Popular session bass guitarist and Disresputable Few member, Paul Ill, joined the band at Steve\u2019s urging and perfectly rounded out the Kenneth Brian Band sound. \u201cThose two were the perfect combination for what I do,\u201d said Kenneth. \u201cTheir influence has helped elevate my playing and just being around Steve is a master class on how to be a successful artist and a decent human being,\u201d he continued. In true KBB form, the sound of the new album honors a distinctive blend of Southern Rock that is both progressive and rooted in tradition.\n\nWhile Kenneth currently resides in Los Angeles, he originally hails from the South. Born in Virginia, he spent some of his formative years in Alabama before his family settled in the musically rich town of Gainesville, Florida. From a very young age, he realized his passion for creating music and has pursued it with vigor. He penned his first country song on an old guitar at the ripe age of 4 and became serious about the guitar at age 11.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville in 2001, Kenneth hit the road with a new sound steeped in tradition.\n\n\u2018With Lions,\u2019 out May 19, 2017 on Robo Records, was recorded at Dave\u2019s Room Studio in Hollywood, California.

This album follows their 2009 studio release, Pacific Dust, and a four-disc retrospective compilation, Days of Sun and Grass, both of which garnered critical praise from outlets including The New Yorker, Mojo, Relix, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and cemented the band's reputation as creators of \"California Soul.\" Co-founded by principal songwriter/lead vocalist Tim Bluhm and guitarist/vocalist Greg Loiacono, the Mother Hips has spawned its own community and even its own rock festival, Hipnic. Held at Big Sur, Hipnic is now in its fifth year and has featured like-minded California bands including Cass McCombs, Jackie Greene, Al Jardine, Neal Casal, Dawes and others.\n\nIt's been a long, winding journey since their 1993 debut on Rick Rubin's American Recordings, Back to the Grotto, through to the present day, which finds them in full charge of their own careers. Through it all, the Mother Hips are self-sustaining and, 20 years in, continue to operate as a cottage industry. The band also has its own beer and its own wine.\n\nBehind Beyond, recorded over the past year at Mission Bells Studio in San Francisco with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, finds Bluhm wading cautiously into midlife, exploring thoughts of mortality as if it were a hazy dream. Loiacono, the man behind the many instrumental passages that weave through the album, says that this album \"stretches out a lot more than any of our other records.\" There's a sense of ease with these songs, from the laid-back feel of \"Isle Not of Man\" to the psychedelic guitar interplay of \"Jefferson Army.\"\n\n\nBluhm is the tall, rugged, frontman that pulls the listener in while Loiacono is the compact, explosive guitar ace that drives the music. But it's their partnership -- the unique, almost brotherly way they sing and play together -- that defines the band.\n\nWhen asked what makes this album special, the two bandleaders come at it from a different angle. Loiacono references the second track, \"Freed From A Prison,\" a song he wrote but that Bluhm sings, citing the ability to let go of the song that made it work. \"That song is about the concept of being freed from a prison you didn't even know you were in,\" he says. \"It's this idea of finally opening up to an experience that was there for you the whole time. To me, a lot of this album is like that.\"\n\nBluhm says that making the music meaningful -- going beyond just having a solid, well-played tune -- is the most important thing for him. \"It's about making creative choices that are unconventional but that are still appealing that hopefully can reach the listener in a way they didn't expect and affect parts of their heart and mind they didn't expect to be affected by rock music, he says. I'm trying to make music that has a spiritual aspect where it's more than just a good song and more than just a rocking band or a commodity, an emotional experience that you might not even know is happening because it's surrounded by a loud rock band.\"\n\nIt all started in 1990 at California State University in Chico when Bluhm and Loaicano found themselves living in the same house, teaching each other guitar chords and experimenting with harmony. They didn't realize it but they were laying the foundation for a sound, a style and a partnership that would last their entire lives. The Hips were signed to Rick Rubin's American Recordings while still in college and released their debut in 1993, followed by 1995's Part Timer Goes Full and 1996's Shootout. The band found themselves swept up into the life of major label touring, along with the heavy partying and relentless grind that has destroyed countless bands. Little promotion from the label found the Hips self-releasing 1998's Later Days and regrouping as a band.\n\nSince then, they've gone on to release independent studio albums (Green Hills of Earth, Kiss The Crystal Flake, and Pacific Dust) and have cultivated one of the most rabid and loyal fan bases in rock today. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, the Hips returned from a four-year hiatus (2001 - 2005) to find that they were more popular than ever. The core line-up of the band has remained stable since 2004, Bluhm, Loiaconco and drummer John Hofer. In 2011, Paul Hoaglin left the band and Frank Zappa and Fear bassist Scott Thunes joined the Hips. These days, the Mother Hips have changed their approach to touring, playing 80 shows a year rather than hundreds, concentrating on well-defined tour markets rather than staying out for long hauls.\n\nToday the Hips are free; they make their own schedule, recording and touring when it feels right. They're a successful independent business as well, having built up a loyal following and community for their sound and gaining the respect of their peers and critics along the way. Bluhm coined the term \"California Soul\" back in 1998 with the song \"Gold Plated\" when he sang: \"There's some boys I know/ who play that rock & roll / they've slept on a lot of floors / to get that California Soul.\" Flash forward nearly two decades. The term has stuck and they're proud of the monicker.\n\n\"California isn't just a state,\" explains Bluhm. \"It's a psychic idea ... the end of the frontier. It's not just a place; it's a style and a state of mind.\"\n\nThe same thing can be said about the Mother Hips.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2174 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Yoshi Flower", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8695622.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.430418, 37.766622], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Rock, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Du Nord", "moreBioInfo": "Yoshi Flower got his first guitar \u2014 a one-of-one custom Taylor, which he still keeps beside him\nin bed most nights \u2014 from a client of his father, who provided pro bono legal work for musicians\nin the Detroit scene throughout the \u201890s.

His father loved the sounds of Australian traditional country singer Slim Dusty and American icons such as Johnny Cash and Marty Robbins. When he wasn't listening to music at home,\nmuch of his childhood was spent onstage. At age 8, he won first place at the Port Pirie Country Music Festival. One year later, his dad gave him a few guitar lessons, and by age 10, he was playing a custom-made acoustic guitar. At 12, he was chosen to represent Australia on a three-week tour of Europe, performing at the International Music for Youth festivals held in France, Belgium and Sweden. His early teens involved practicing guitar for hours and waiting for his voice to change.\n\nOne night, he heard the Ricky Skaggs song \"Country Boy\" on the radio and was hooked on Skaggs' rapid-fire blend of country and bluegrass. Through a friend who was a bluegrass mandolin champion, Kym Warner, Hughes was introduced to some of the greats of bluegrass music. He heard the sounds of Tony Rice, Del McCoury and Ralph Stanley and was taken with the music's purity. He was also drawn to country legends like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard.\n\nHe traveled throughout his teenage years as a sideman with various country entertainers. After high school he had one goal -- to attend South Plains College in Levelland, Texas, which offers a bluegrass music program. Terry McBride, formerly of McBride & the Ride, did a workshop at the college and, impressed with Hughes' talent, offered to write with him if he ever moved to Nashville. Soon after, Hughes relocated to Nashville and they began collaborating.\n\nJust six weeks after landing in Music City, Hughes auditioned to be the lead guitarist for Patty Loveless. Within an hour, he was asked to join Loveless' rehearsal and then was invited to play the Grand Ole Opry with her the next night and later at the MerleFest bluegrass festival.\n\nDuring his days off from playing with Loveless, Hughes cut demos with McBride and attracted interest from MCA Nashville. He will release his debut album, with guest appearances by Alison Krauss and Loveless, on MCA in August 2004.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1807 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Penny and Sparrow", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9689397.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Fox Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Duo.

(SCROLL FOR LINKS)\nThe band Thrive was formed under the Redwoods of Mendocino County, in Northern CA, in 2008.Songwriters Aaron Borowitz and Kenneth Rogers joined forces, in order to create music that they love with an emphasis on conscious lyrical content.In 2010, Thrive released their debut full-length album, \u201cGratitude Attitude\u201d. It came as a surprise to the relatively unknown group that the album was received with open arms by the Reggae community, soaring to #5 on iTunes Reggae Charts.Prior to this album the band had only toured CA, performing at whatever house party or bar that would have them. But after the album released, offers started coming in for shows and tours. The band finally landed their first legitimate support slot in 2011, as direct support to the band SOJA on the \u201cEverything Changes Tour.\u201d This was a pivotal moment in the band\u2019s career. Fans really connected with the real-life message in Thrive\u2019s lyrics, which pushed them forward on their musical journey.Since then Thrive has performed alongside world-class acts such as Damian Marley, Ky-mani Marley, Stephen Marley, Rebelution, Iration, Slightly Stoopid, Katchafire, Chronixx, Protoje, Alborosie, Gentleman, John Brown\u2019s Body, and countless others.In 2013, the now established group released \u201cRelentless\u201d , their second full length album. This album featured Eric Rachmany (Rebelution) on the single \u201cJust Fine\u201d. The album sold well, reaching #3 on iTunes Reggae charts, and #6 on the Billboard Reggae Charts. The release of the album was followed by a performance at California Roots Music And Arts Festival, where they were joined on stage by members of Rebelution and Tribal Seeds.Soon after the release of the album, Thrive released another single entitled \u201cBroken\u201d. The single featured Hirie, who at the time had just emerged onto the Reggae scene. This would be the final recording of the band\u2019s beloved Saxophonist, Scott Schipper, who the band often referred to as their \u201csecret weapon\u201d. Scott had an undeniable light that he passed along to all he met. Unfortunately, Scott lost his battle to cancer soon after the recording of the single. He toured with the band while undergoing chemotherapy, and never missed a show right up until the end. Rest in peace Scott Jordan Schipper.The band continued to tour for the next couple of years, performing at many respected festivals and live music venues. During this time Thrive began to headline more shows and build their fan base throughout many markets. It wasn\u2019t long before they started to sell-out shows in the markets they had begun to build in, years earlier.In 2015 the group released the Thrive EP. This EP featured Trevor Young (SOJA) on the single \u201cThe Gift\u201d. It was a creative collaboration as the album was co-produced, mixed, and mastered by Brad Watanabe (The Green). This album also featured the song \u201cOne\u201d, a fan favorite, promoting a message of unity.Currently Thrive is knee-deep into the post-production of their most anticipated release, \u201cBe Love\u201d. Their new album will be a reflection of everything the group has learned in the last decade of non-stop musical adventures. The band will be touring in support of this album all summer.\nCLICKABLE LINKS\nFB - facebook.com/thrivingmusic\nIG - instagram.com/thrivingmusic\nTwitter - twitter.com/thrivingmusic\nYouTube - youtube.com/user/Thrivetheband\nSpotify - open.spotify.com/artist/21aafa4Vkm2UEV4a2TY8Zj\niTunes - itunes.apple.com/us/artist/thrive/519819699"}, {"Address": "1522 Francisco Blvd, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "Jesus & The Dinosaurs", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10114795.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.49051, 37.636718], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Rock, Punk, Garage Punk, Rockn Roll, Garage", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Winters Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "The Dinosaurs roam between the Bay Area and Sacramento, laying their own mix of fuzzed out garage with scaly bilingual punk.

Their roots are into classic punk and garage sound, but their music soon developed a grittier hardcore age, tipping the hat off to some of the most influential groups in the genre - from Fear to The Misfits and everything in between. Ever since their start, FUKM had the chance to perform live extensively, even sharing the stage with acts like Lower Class Brats, Fang, MDC, and Verbal Abuse, among others.\n\nThe band\u2019s recordings have some old-school aesthetics, yet their sound is remarkably modern, echoing the sound of contemporary bands like OFF!, another staple of California punk rock. The group has a handful of tunes out there on the web, including their vitriolic 2017 single, \u201cBombs Away.\u201d In addition to that, they are gearing up for some new surprises in 2020, so stay tuned!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1601 Civic Dr, Walnut Creek, CA 94596", "Artist": "Rick Springfield", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7439588.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.063673, 37.901018], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Power Pop, Classic Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Lesher Center for the Arts", "moreBioInfo": "Rick Springfield\u2019s first love has always been music, a lifelong passion ignited after picking up his first guitar at the age of 12 in his native Australia. Mastering the craft of songwriting far preceded his accomplishments as an actor and best-selling author.\n\nWith 25 million records sold, a Grammy\u00ae Award for his No. 1 smash-hit Jessie\u2019s Girl, and whopping 17 Top-40 hits including Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers, An Affair of the Heart, I've Done Everything for You, Love Somebody and Human Touch, Springfield has no intention of taking his foot off the accelerator. \u201cI put everything I've got into making records,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes people think they have you pegged but I trust my music show them otherwise.\u201d\n\nNever one to be confined to the recording studio where the music is born, Springfield has toured for over 30 years, hand-delivering the hits to millions of fans worldwide during his legendary, high-energy live shows. Hardly content walking in his own footprints for very long, fall 2013 saw Springfield reinvent himself yet again performing for the first time as a purely solo act. Rick Springfield\u2019s \u201cStripped Down\u201d performances offer an intimate glimpse in to the amazing life he\u2019s experienced through music, with personal stories introducing each song in the set. \u201cSome are favorite songs that I\u2019ve written that I\u2019ve never performed live because they\u2019ve never quite fit into the full band live show. I think fans are as excited to now hear these songs live as I am to play them.\u201d\n\nExcited fans, sell-out shows and overwhelming critical acclaim have made Rick Springfield \u201cStripped Down\u201d one of the must-see shows of 2014. \u201c\u2026fans came in droves, selling out both shows practically from the get go\u2026the night as a whole achieved its purpose of revealing several unseen sides of Springfield beyond the most obvious\u2026\u201d says the Illinois Entertainer.\n\nSpringfield will take a short hiatus from his successful \u201cStripped Down\u201d solo tour this summer, hitting the road with his band on a co-headlining tour with friends Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo. The multi-city tour kicks off June 28th in Atlanta, GA with additional dates across the U.S. through July. This tour marks the first time that Rick will tour with Pat & Neil. Springfield says, \u201cAlthough I first met Pat and Neil when Neil played on the original recording of Jessie\u2019s Girl in 1980, it took 35 years before we got together to tour. It should be one for the books.\u201d Following his summer tour, Springfield will return to his native Australia this October for his first headline tour there in 20 years. Springfield will wrap up 2014 with an additional string of \u201cStripped Down\u201d performances.\n\nOn May 6th 2014, Simon & Schuster\u2019s Touchtone imprint will publish Springfield\u2019s fiction debut, MAGNIFICENT VIBRATION. Already receiving rave reviews, Booklist says, \u201cCaptivating, poignant, and hilarious, MAGNIFICENT VIBRATION proves that some of the most interesting stories can come from pretty unlikely places.\u201d The deeply meaningful and over-the-top novel features a hero who has hit a dead end in his life but who serendipitously receives an 800 connection to God via an inscription in a mysterious self-help book and who just may have a shot at saving the planet. \"The only good grades I ever got in school before I was kicked out were for creative writing,\u201d says Springfield. \u201cI thought that fiction might be in my future but then my career took a different path once the Beatles showed me what a blast being in a band could be. Writing my memoir reminded me how much I love the craft. So I decided to give fiction a shot again. MAGNIFICENT VIBRATION is the result. I\u2019m still not quite sure where it came from, but once I got going, it practically wrote itself. I\u2019ve heard writers I admire speak of that phenomenon, so maybe I\u2019m on the right track.\u201d\n\nSpringfield\u2019s autobiography, Late, Late at Night (Touchstone 2010) entered The New York Times best-seller list at No. 13 while also landing on the Los Angeles Times and Publishers Weekly top-sellers lists. Rolling Stone named it one of the top-25 rock memoirs of all time. In Late, Late At Night, which Springfield wrote entirely himself, Rick speaks frankly about the depression he\u2019s battled throughout his life. \u201cI\u2019m not the shiny, happy guy people think I am. I suppose they confuse who I really am with my stage persona,\u201d says Springfield. \u201cBut good can come from hardship. Depression causes me to over-analyze events in my life, and that\u2019s actually a bonus when it comes to songwriting. Hey, if things had gone my way at the time and I\u2019d gotten laid, Jessie\u2019s Girl would never have been written.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Springfield teamed up with Dave Grohl on Grohl\u2019s multi-faceted passion project, Sound City, which encompassed a documentary (Sound City), an album (Sound City: Real to Reel), and the Sound City Players tour, a string of critically acclaimed shows with fellow documentary subjects including Stevie Nicks, Trent Reznor, John Fogerty, and Lee Ving among others. The Foo Fighters served as backing band for Rick\u2019s set with Dave Grohl\u2019s notable declarations during the performances as, \"I want to be Rick Springfield!\" and \u201cBucket list. Check!\" CraveOnline called Sound City: Real to Reel \u201ca powerhouse collection of some of the greatest musical talent ever assembled.\u201d Springfield and Grohl co-wrote The Man That Never Was, which was inspired by a true story from World War II. \u201cWriting music can be a solo endeavor but at its heart, rock is collaborative. Working with Dave and the Foo Fighters was collaboration at its best. Those guys are true musicians: creative, spontaneous, generous, and talented. Working with them was a great experience.\u201d The Man That Never Was has been widely recognized by critics as one of the best songs on the Sound City soundtrack. \u201cThe highlights\u2026 are led by Stevie Nicks and, yes, Rick Springfield.\u201d (People) Springfield has also been hailed for his part in the documentary: \u201cThe film's breakout story is arguably Rick Springfield.\u201d (Rolling Stone) The Sound City: Real to Reel CD also won the 2014 Grammy\u00ae for Best Compilation Soundtrack.\n\nIn October 2012, Springfield released, Songs for the End of the World, his 17th studio recording and collaboration with songwriter Matt Bissonette. Songs for the End of the World addresses the need to be consoled and cherished in an age of anxiety about the future of the planet. Filled with personal lyrics and giant hooks, it\u2019s a pop/rock tour de force. \u201cIt's high energy,\u201d Rick explains about the album\u2019s mix of moods. \u201cAt its core, it\u2019s about looking for love and solace while the world around us\u2014everything we once felt sure about\u2014disintegrates. Even with the end so palpably imminent, we\u2019re still human beings, filled with longing and\u2014maybe against all odds\u2014hope. I believe music is healing,\u201d says Springfield. The Tampa Bay Times said, \u201cSpringfield remains one of the best live entertainers of his generation -- maybe the top dog -- so if he wants to explore darker closets on studio albums, I'm not going to discourage him one bit. Especially when the result is a project I enjoy as much as this one.\u201d\n\nAlso in 2012, an independently produced documentary titled An Affair of the Heart captured the relationship between Rick Springfield and his loyal fanbase. The documentary debuted at numerous film festivals, winning special jury awards at the Nashville, Florida, Boston, and Daytona Film Festivals. An Affair of the Heart premiered to record numbers on the EPIX channel in May 2013 and is now available on DVD.\n\nIn the early \u201970s, Springfield had a handful of hit records in his native Australia before emigrating to the United States. Bouncing between record labels and looking to make ends meet until his musical career took hold in the US, he resorted to acting and eventually landing the role of Dr. Noah Drake during the heyday and cult phenomenon of daytime TV\u2019s General Hospital. Simultaneously, the explosive success of his breakthrough 1981 album Working Class Dog was followed by Success Hasn\u2019t Spoiled Me Yet, Living in Oz, Hard to Hold soundtrack and Tao, establishing Springfield as a multi-platinum superstar. Despite his original and unwavering passion for music, many at the time mistook Springfield for a soap star hoping to convert daytime success to a faux and possibly fleeting music career. History proves that nothing could have been further from the truth. Springfield is content to let his music and four decades of productivity speak for itself. \u201cIf you pay attention to where I\u2019ve put my time, who I really am becomes clear.\u201d In addition to General Hospital, Rick\u2019s other notable TV roles include a 4-episode arc on Californication, Hawaii Five-O, Drop Dead Diva, Hot In Cleveland and the 1994-1997 TV series High Tide.\n\nSpringfield\u2019s current musical career renaissance can be traced back to the albums Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance (2004) and Venus in Overdrive (Ume, 2008), which entered the Billboard sales charts at No. 28, his highest debut in 20 years. In 2005, Sony Legacy\u2019s released the retrospective double CD Written in Rock: The Rick Springfield Anthology.\n\nOfficial web site: http://www.rickspringfield.com\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/rickspringfield\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/rickspringfield\nOn Instagram: http://instagram.com/rickspringfield\nOn YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/rsadmin", "otherInfo": "Concert to benefit Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), Friends of Camp Concord (FCC), Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS), and Boys and Girls Club (BGC).

(SCROLL FOR LINKS)\nThe band Thrive was formed under the Redwoods of Mendocino County, in Northern CA, in 2008.Songwriters Aaron Borowitz and Kenneth Rogers joined forces, in order to create music that they love with an emphasis on conscious lyrical content.In 2010, Thrive released their debut full-length album, \u201cGratitude Attitude\u201d. It came as a surprise to the relatively unknown group that the album was received with open arms by the Reggae community, soaring to #5 on iTunes Reggae Charts.Prior to this album the band had only toured CA, performing at whatever house party or bar that would have them. But after the album released, offers started coming in for shows and tours. The band finally landed their first legitimate support slot in 2011, as direct support to the band SOJA on the \u201cEverything Changes Tour.\u201d This was a pivotal moment in the band\u2019s career. Fans really connected with the real-life message in Thrive\u2019s lyrics, which pushed them forward on their musical journey.Since then Thrive has performed alongside world-class acts such as Damian Marley, Ky-mani Marley, Stephen Marley, Rebelution, Iration, Slightly Stoopid, Katchafire, Chronixx, Protoje, Alborosie, Gentleman, John Brown\u2019s Body, and countless others.In 2013, the now established group released \u201cRelentless\u201d , their second full length album. This album featured Eric Rachmany (Rebelution) on the single \u201cJust Fine\u201d. The album sold well, reaching #3 on iTunes Reggae charts, and #6 on the Billboard Reggae Charts. The release of the album was followed by a performance at California Roots Music And Arts Festival, where they were joined on stage by members of Rebelution and Tribal Seeds.Soon after the release of the album, Thrive released another single entitled \u201cBroken\u201d. The single featured Hirie, who at the time had just emerged onto the Reggae scene. This would be the final recording of the band\u2019s beloved Saxophonist, Scott Schipper, who the band often referred to as their \u201csecret weapon\u201d. Scott had an undeniable light that he passed along to all he met. Unfortunately, Scott lost his battle to cancer soon after the recording of the single. He toured with the band while undergoing chemotherapy, and never missed a show right up until the end. Rest in peace Scott Jordan Schipper.The band continued to tour for the next couple of years, performing at many respected festivals and live music venues. During this time Thrive began to headline more shows and build their fan base throughout many markets. It wasn\u2019t long before they started to sell-out shows in the markets they had begun to build in, years earlier.In 2015 the group released the Thrive EP. This EP featured Trevor Young (SOJA) on the single \u201cThe Gift\u201d. It was a creative collaboration as the album was co-produced, mixed, and mastered by Brad Watanabe (The Green). This album also featured the song \u201cOne\u201d, a fan favorite, promoting a message of unity.Currently Thrive is knee-deep into the post-production of their most anticipated release, \u201cBe Love\u201d. Their new album will be a reflection of everything the group has learned in the last decade of non-stop musical adventures.

It\u2019s a musical relationship that has endured for over two decades, with band members playing in numerous projects together and apart. Following the 2012 release of their freewheeling Sounds Like This, the band took time off to work on various side projects. Zach Gill (keys/vocals) toured the world with the band\u2019s college pal Jack Johnson; Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar/vocals) played shows with the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh; Steve Adams (bass/vocals) toured and recorded with Nicki Bluhm & the Gramblers; Dave Brogan (drums/vocals) joined up with Utah band, Mokie. These and other endeavors have influenced the band\u2019s new album Tangle Of Time.\n\nMore than previous releases, Tangle Of Time really taps into what makes ALO unique. It\u2019s that special blend of classic songwriting and the ability to stretch out jams and distill dance floor grooves. It's heartfelt lyrics that make you smile, reflect and just want to sing along either way. It's four great musicians who all write and sing. And four friends who've been through a lot together and still support, challenge and inspire one another.\n\nEntering Allegiant Records in San Anselmo, California this past January with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, the four members decided they\u2019d take a different recording approach. Instead of spending pre-production days jamming and co-writing, each member brought in their own demos, roughly three dozen in total, for the group to listen to, pick apart and eventually whittle down to the 11 songs that make up Tangle Of Time. Once they narrowed their focus, they turned their attention to arrangements and production techniques. Songs were tightened up, layers made more experimental and the end results validated their new approach.\n\nLebo described the shared respect and admiration the band felt during the recording process this way: \"There are four strong opinions in the room, but playing together for so long we've all become pretty good at the empathy thing at this point; we can be very Zen about it. We truly value being together at this point in our careers, and whatever we get from our solo and side gigs, no matter how much fun we have, it's not this.\"\n\nThat sort of maturity, the ability to take stock of your friends, loved ones, and collaborators, and truly appreciate them is certainly one of the cornerstones of Tangle Of Time. Lebo, Adams and Gill first started playing music together in middle school, and then with Brogan right after college. Somehow, these relationships have lasted, evolved and been made stronger every year. One can almost hear the group releasing a satisfied existential sigh throughout the album, finding acceptance, love and contentment with the world they've built.\n\n\"I really appreciate the guys right now, more so than ever,\" Gill shared, excitedly adding, \"Years ago the feeling was, 'I wanna get to my songs and see how they sound while we're all here', whereas now I'm rooting for everyone else's songs. It's great.\"\n\nThat approach of supporting each other\u2019s songs worked like a charm, capturing each member\u2019s distinct songwriting voice, while simultaneously expanding the notion of what an ALO song or album can be. Take for instance the one-two-punch of the synth-filled, spacey jam vehicle \"The Ticket\" and the pedal steel-driven easy-going happiness of \"Simple Times\". Although two ends of the sonic spectrum, both are classic Gill songs at their core but stretched wide and far by the band\u2019s collective effort.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lebo's guitar epic \"Undertow\" is a song that practically begs to be stretched out live, with its swirling double guitar outro intoxicating the listener to such a degree that you might find yourself on the band's website, dreamily purchasing tickets for an entire run of shows just to see where the song ventures live. Lebo pairs this with \"Push\", a jaunty yet thoughtful number with a playful guitar riff that's basically the musical equivalent of joy.\n\n\"Not Old Yet\" and \"Keep On\", Adams\u2019 contributions to the album, are also touchstones to the spirit of Tangle Of Time. The first is a light-hearted romp about keeping a positive perspective on life\u2019s long road of hurdles and surprises, while the second is an upbeat, forward-thinking sing-along with lines that could be the album's mantra: \"Wherever this takes us, I know/That we've got each other, we've still got a long way to go.\"\n\nBrogan's \"Coast To Coast\" is among the most intriguing songs on the record. He, along with co-writer buddy Ben Malan, came up with a layer-upon-layer soundscape consisting of beautifully esoteric textures. The funky but ominous track tells the surreal tale of a band on the run, with more ideas and energy than know-how. Brogan shared that the theme of \u201ctangled time\u201d materialized unexpectedly over the course of the sessions, elaborating: \"There's a point where there is more behind you than ahead of you, and you realize that time becomes a limiting factor.\"\n\nPut the record on your turntable, and you can clearly hear the band\u2019s excitement to get back on the road and explore these songs with their audience. Improvisation is a staple of what the band does, and as Adams stated: \"Being in that unknown is such a great life lesson beyond just the music. For all the careful planning and preparing we do, being in the moment is really when it all matters.\"\n\nThe band is also planning new ways to expand the theatrical shenanigans that have become a fantastic complement to the live show. From confetti canons to 12-foot beach balls, pre-show skits to elaborate theme nights, bubble suits to a laser-shooting ukulele (yes, really)... ALO is always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to interact with fans to make their shows truly special. Gill, the band's head prankster, put it this way: \"I want people to come to a show expecting to be engaged in a fun and creative way. When I see someone dancing or singing along or reaching out to hit a giant beach ball, I start playing to the dancer and at that point, it's really a circle of energy traveling back and forth from the stage. The larger theatrical concepts are ways of interacting with the audience on another level.\"\n\nOn Tangle Of Time the band has reached that other level, and are ready to bring everyone along.", "otherInfo": "All ages show."}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "YOUTH CODE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7802118.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Industrial Rock, Alternative, Ebmindustrial", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Los Angeles Duo Youth Code are raw, punishing, industrious electronics built from the seeds of hardcore and early Wax Trax.

Pepper and Abbey Road eras and beyond.\n\nBased in the Los Angeles area, the band has toured extensively since its founding in 1997 -- performing at hundreds of venues throughout the U.S. and in many countries across the globe, including Japan, Malaysia, France, Hong Kong, The United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil -- where they've skillfully recreated the Beatles' music multiple thousands of times, yet always with a freshness and excitement that audiences love.\n\nWhat makes The Fab Four unique among Beatles tribute bands is the not-so-simple fact that the four band members play all their own music live. This is just one more factor that gives their performances an energy and immediacy that backing tracks and sequencers can\u2019t.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the Beatles\u2019 later work and the fact that it was never intended to be performed live, what The Fab Four do onstage is phenomenal. Without a \u201cfifth Beatle\u201d anywhere in sight to make their job easier, these four highly accomplished musicians recreate all the sounds of an incredibly diverse catalog of Beatles favorites 100 percent live and in real time -- and their technical precision, musical artistry, and onstage chemistry make every concert a stunning performance!\n\nAudiences will appreciate their dynamic stage presence and the almost boundless energy that keeps them moving around the stage practically non-stop throughout the night, as they systematically move through the different Beatles eras, changing costumes between sets to represent the early Beatlemania years, the Sgt. Pepper/psychedelic era, and the Abbey Road period and beyond, with many shows also including a Shea Stadium set.\n\nThe band typically changes costumes twice, for a total of three period-perfect looks: the identical black chesterfield suits worn by the original lads during their Ed Sullivan Show debut, the colorful satin Sgt. Pepper uniforms and regalia worn by the Beatles during their psychedelic era, and the totally divergent clothing styles that marked the later Beatles and post-Beatles years. Select shows also feature the beige safari-style jackets and black trousers that have come to be known as the Beatles' Shea Stadium suits.\n\nThe band also periodically plays specialty shows for various Beatles-related anniversaries, such as shows that feature an entire Beatles album, played from start to finish, along with additional selections from the rest of the Beatles' extensive catalog. True to the material and era they cover, each of these shows brings in additional, highly authentic costumes from the period.\n\nThe Fab Four truly are The Ultimate Tribute to The Beatles -- the most accurate representation of the originals you'll find this side of the 1960s!", "otherInfo": "Emmy Award-winning Beatles tribute band The Fab Four is a highly polished tribute act that has been wowing audiences across the U.S. and around the world with its dynamic portrayal of the Beatles for over two decades.

Of those years, he has spent a jaw-dropping 25 on the hallowed fields of the Major Leagues as both a hard-charging player and a steely-eyed field general. He has been to the World Series four times- once as a player and three times as a coach, finally wrapping his battered, dusty hands around the World Series Trophy in 2010...and yet again in 2012 and 2014. Impressive credentials for any man, but here's the thing- baseball is only a part of his story. He is also a prolific and talented songwriter. That's right- this ferociously hard-working baseball legend is also an award-nominated musician who regularly packs venues across the globe. He is a seasoned fingerstyle legend of Americana music with a gift for crafting potent, resonant songs and delivering energetic, emotional live shows. His name is Tim Flannery and he is writing some of the most gorgeous acoustic music to roll out of California since the halcyon days of the Seventies folk explosion. \"Flan,\" as he's known to family, friends and players, started playing baseball as a kid and its hold on him has never loosened. As a player for his hometown San Diego Padres, each season would begin with Tim's manager cautioning him that his position would likely go to someone younger, faster or more gifted. A warrior to the core, Flan distilled such negativity into furious motivation, out-running, out-gunning and out-hustling every guy on the team to secure his spot on the roster. Unsurprisingly, his relentless work ethic and fearless playing style made him a fan favorite and to this day, he is a much-beloved icon from the surf breaks of Oceanside, California to the furthest tip of Mexico's Baja Peninsula. When his playing career came to a close, Flan took to coaching with the same passion and savvy that propelled him to such auspicious heights as a player. He moved from the minor league system back into the Majors as a third base coach for the Padres, and in 2008 he took over third base coaching duties for the San Francisco Giants, where he patrolled the left side of the field like a wolf, managing the team's offensive attack with equal measures of strategy and pure guts. Flan announced his retirement from baseball shortly after the San Francisco Giants earned their third World Series championship in 5 years. Tim has spent the majority of his life on the road, balancing his career and his creative drive with the love of his wife and three children. His music explores the depths of emotion that only loneliness and solitude can reveal, as well as the profound emotional highs unlocked in a golden surfing session or in the majesty of a star-spangled sky from a back porch in Kentucky. Flan's music enjoys radio support across the planet, from the shores of Ireland to beach towns up and down the California coast. He is routinely supported by an obscenely talented band and he has been joined onstage by the likes of Jackson Browne, Bruce Hornsby, Garth Brooks and Jimmy Buffet. With a voice as smooth as Kentucky bourbon and heart worn on both sleeves, Flan's concerts ebb and flow with brilliant melodies, soaring harmonies and themes of love, travel and connecting with the Great Spirit. And of course, he sings about baseball.

But spend some time with the songs, and you\u2019ll begin to uncover the weighty themes McKee has expertly hidden inside them.\n\nSuper Whatevr\u2019s songs don\u2019t seek to push away the darkness. Instead, they invite it in, realizing the only way to move past life\u2019s problems is to tackle them head-on. They\u2019re songs that force listeners to confront the ugliness in ourselves (\u201cTelelelevision\u201d) and those closest to us (\u201cFor You\u201d). They come from a dark place, but they\u2019re undercut with a ray of hope.\n\n\u201cAll my songs are happy,\u201d McKee explains. \u201cThey have a sad tone, but it\u2019s all in a positive manner. I want to help people grow and be vulnerable. If it\u2019s got to be dark, then it\u2019s going to be dark. It doesn\u2019t hurt me, because I know it\u2019s going to help me grow and help other people grow.\u201d\n\nSuper Whatevr was born as a vehicle for McKee\u2019s poetry in 2013. Up until that point he had only played bass, but began studying the craft of songwriting with the help of a friend and penning songs of his own. Armed with a trio of influential albums (Cage the Elephant\u2019s Thank You, Happy Birthday, Tokyo Police Club\u2019s Champ and Manchester Orchestra\u2019s COPE), his songwriting foundation took roots in emotive, dynamic rock\u2014all undercut with hyper-personal lyricism. 2016\u2019s Good Luck EP introduced Super Whatevr to the world, and Never Nothing is poised to help McKee become a force in the underground.\n\nFrom the album\u2019s title (\u201cThe concept of the album title is that [what might be wrong with you] is never \u2018nothing,\u2019\u201d McKee says) and symbolic artwork (a piece called \u201cOut Of You Becomes Me\u201d) to the songs themselves, Never Nothing is a comprehensive, cathartic work about pushing past your demons on the way to self-betterment. Above all else, McKee hopes it\u2019ll serve as a conduit for happier lives\u2014and not only his own.\n\n\u201cI plan on starting an online therapy session with the therapist who got me through what I was dealing with,\u201d McKee says. \u201cI\u2019ll be directing anyone who needs help to that.

With over a dozen recent high-profile releases, and a stacked tour schedule already in full effect, a new era has begun, and more new tunes are on the way.\n\nOver the past several years, Dirt Monkey has carved his uplifting, bouncy, and unique sounds into the Denver dubstep community, and onto the national touring scene. He finished last year with a strong release schedule: \u201cWubula\u201d (SubCarbon), \u201cBeef\u201d w/ Bookie T (SubCarbon), \u201cThe Disciple Roundtable EP\u201d (Disciple), and multiple releases on Wakaan. He took this brisk pace into to a fall tour with Bear Grillz and a Ganja White Night tour at the beginning of this year that sold out nearly every date.\n\nAs a pioneer in the dubstep and bass music genres, Dirt Monkey has garnered support from many of his peers: Skream, Benga, Rusko, Excision, Zeds Dead, Griz, Virtual Riot, Annie Nightingale (BBC Radio 1), Flux Pavilion, Downlink, Ganja White Night, and Protohype. Dirt Monkey\u2019s recent remix of Rusko\u2019s \u201cWoo Boost\u201d (SubCarbon) was supported by Rusko himself, and his recent \u201cWubula\u201d album gained wide support across the festival circuit from broad swaths of well-known DJs.\n\nHe has worked and collaborated with a wide-variety of artists such as: Ganja White Night, DMVU, Illenium, Party Wave, Run DMT w Barrington Levy, AMP Live, and Jantsen. Dirt Monkey has performed at a countless number of breathtaking venues, including Red Rocks Amphitheatre, clubs in France, and Beta Nightclub in Denver, CO (where he has held a residency for the last 5 years). Also, for the past four years, he established and ran the record label, Kairos Audio, before handing it off to label partner and co-founder, Jantsen Robertson.\n\nFresh off a sold out co-headline tour with Subtronics, he used that momentum to go full steam into a headlining set at Shambhala. The wubs-master also made stops at EDC Las Vegas, Global Dance Festival, Nocturnal Wonderland, and Lost Lands and he\u2019 currently in the middle of a 40+ date fall tour in support of his most recent release on Rise of the Octopeel.\n\nDirt Monkey has always strived to fuse the wonky, high-energy sounds of old school dubstep, and the crisp sounds of IDM.

Norton and Edward A. Williams had been through a number of musical endeavours individually - including duos - and the prospect of a new project sounded intriguing. As details were hashed out, the core principles became readily evident: have fun and tour often. With a large stable of strong self and co-written songs and a prominent mission statement, Ash and Ed were ready to embark on a new journey. All that was needed was a name.\n\nAgain, a question: \u201cHow about \u2018whitherward\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe name took quickly, gaining a life of its own; within days, a website was created, local shows were booked, recordings were done, and a small tour was constructed. It was exciting and validating; a musical project where the sky was the limit, and no challenge seemed insurmountable.\n\nThen, after surveying the current outlook of their career, a new question arose: \u201cWhat if we toured full-time?\u201d\n\nIt would mean a lot of sacrifice - regular work schedules would be scuttled, permanent housing foregone, and material possessions reduced to a minimum. The performance requirements of sustaining a full-time tour would be grueling, and the workload more than doubles when considering the financial commitment required of being on the road indefinitely.\n\nBut amongst all the new responsibilities and stresses, there\u2019s an inherent mystery about the open road - from a typical human vantage, it\u2019s impossible to see what is around the next bend, over the next hill. In an ironic twist, this provides a startling clarity about life and how it can be lived - as so many people profess - day by day. When you can only see as far as the next hill, it somehow manages to decrease the amount of worry about what\u2019s on the other side. Rather, it helps to build a sense of wonder for what\u2019s over there, and you want to keep pushing to see it for yourself.\n\nThe duo now has four self-produced, self-published EPs full of intricate, thoughtful music, putting the emotions of life on the road and outside of the box on display. A full length album is in the works. New collaborations with bassist Patrick Hershey and violinist Stephanie Groot on both the 4th EP and the upcoming full-length album expand the sonic landscape of the duo\u2019s efforts. In addition to playing over 200 shows a year, their travels enable them to reach a number of diehard fans, new destinations, and old friends that serve to grow an ever-expanding audience.\n\nWhitherward is an Old English adverb that means \u201cin which direction\u201d. The word seems to invite an eternal question; it feels like the perfect fit for a duo that constantly seeks to reinvent itself in every aspect of its existence, always looking for the next impossible question to answer. There is forward; there is backward; and then there is Whitherward.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "412 14th St, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Jota Mercury", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9202543.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.270302, 37.804256], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Golden Bull Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Jota (pronounced HO-TAH) Mercury is an international award winning drag king who works to constantly challenge the ideologies of machismo and male dominance.

From the Netherlands, Xymox was established in 1985 by frontman Ronny Moorings and then-livein Anke Wolbert. Their first EP, Subsequent Pleasures added Pieter Nooten afterwards on keyboards and left a mark on an emerging Euro-wave market.\n\nA chance meeting with Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance led to an invitation to support that band on a UK tour, and then a recording contract with their record label, 4AD.\n\nTheir first two full length albums, self-titled Clan of Xymox and Medusa, comfortably settled Xymox into their own niche of blooming melodics and smooth grey lyrical originality, with Ronnie's songwriting coming as a fresh and very welcome abstract to the plastic and packaged synthpop of the late 80s. In 1989, Ronnie saw a chance to evolve and left 4AD, releasing Twist of Shadows which proved to be their most complete and mature offering thusfar, and was their most successful yet.\n\nWith the next two albums, Phoenix and Metamorphosis, fans were left with something of an out of body experience - as Xymox was sounding nothing like themselves. Metamorphosis was truly that however, its failure created a catalyst for Moorings to jump to yet another label, part ways with his bandmates, and pickup Mojca Zugna on bass. Zok records re-released Metamorphosis and a new EP - Headclouds. Moorings took a four year break to introspect and write, and gave fans the wondrous gift that is Hidden Faces, admittedly the logical followup to Medusa.\n\nThe new millenium ushered in success for Creatures, Notes From the Underground, Farewell , Breaking Point, The BEst Of Clan Of Xymox and the latest DVD release Visible ( 2008) which serve to define what Clan of Xymox has become now - a velvet lined room smelling of roses and clove, the distant chime of crystal engaging crystal, and the slow lilting line of smoke forming nameless shapes as it draws you ever in.\n\nCurrent Lineup:\nRonny Moorings - words, guitar, piano, voice\nMojca Zugna - bass, voice\n\nYvonne de Ray - keyboards\nMario Usai - guitar\n\nDiscography (sans singles)\nSubsequent Pleasures LP 1984\nClan of Xymox 1985\nMedusa 1986\nTwist of Shadows 1989\nPhoenix 1991\nMetamorphosis 1992\nHeadclouds 1993\nSubsequent Pleasures 1994\nOut of the Rain EP 1997\nHidden Faces 1997\nCreatures 1999\nLive 2000\nNotes from the Underground 2001\nRemixes from the Underground 2001\nFarewell 2003\nThe Best of Clan of Xymox 2004\nBreaking Point 2006\nHeroes single 2008\nVisible DVD 2008", "otherInfo": "Clan of Xymox at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "1324 Broadway Plaza, Walnut Creek, CA 94596", "Artist": "Petty Theft", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6277354.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.058098, 37.89436], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Tom Petty, Tribute, Classic Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Broadway Club", "moreBioInfo": "#Makin' Some Noise Tour 2020\n\nSince 2003, San Francisco based Petty Theft has been touring the western United States performing Tom Petty\u2019s songs true to the originals and in the spirit of the Heartbreaker\u2019s live shows.\n\nBest Band San Francisco North Bay \u2013 2011, 2012, 2013\n\u2013 The Bohemian\n\nBest of Marin 2015: Best Local Band \u2013 Pacific Sun\nBest of Marin 2018: Best Cover Band \u2013 Pacific Sun\nBest of Marin 2019: Best Cover Band \u2013 Pacific Sun", "otherInfo": "8:00pm doors / 9:00pm show\n$20 advance / $25 door\n21+"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "August Sun", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:15 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "SOCKEYE (Leftover Salmon Warfield afterparty) + August Sun"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Kos", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/276219.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Techno", "Time": "9:15 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "SOCKEYE (Leftover Salmon/ALO Warfield afterparty)"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Syd Gris", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "A special event welcoming global superstars Gorgon City.

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing, and performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dance floor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 10 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark and sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, \"The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best, and for me this is the new wave in house music.\" He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater\u2019s booty shake. Growing up in Washington DC, Worthy was inspired by the early American rave scene. Upon moving to New York in the late 90\u2019s, he was exposed to artists like LTJ Bukem and Stacey Pullen whose music inspired him to play records across multiple genres, from techno and breaks to hiphop and drum n\u2019 bass. In 2001 he swapped coastlines, moving to San Francisco to pursue his music career. There he teamed up with Claude Von Stroke and Justin and Christian Martin, becoming one of the four founding fathers of the Dirtybird party, Worthy\u2019s breakout track, Irst Te, released on the Dirtybird label in 2007, quickly established his notoriety as a producer. With other bangers like Shy Look, Tric Trac (co-produced with Eats Everything) and the recently release track, Dip, Worthy has been rocking the \u201cDirtybird\u201d sound for nearly a decade now. Concurrently, Worthy has established his own label, Anabatic Records, which has allowed him to be a bit more experimental with his production, and expand his reach as an artist. Some of the songs that have charted on sites such as Beatport include Concubia, Work The Walls, and Flashin. In 2014 Worthy released his debut full-length album, Disbehave, a genre-defying rebellion against the house producers status quo. Breaking down rules and boundaries, Worthy has sought to set himself apart from the mundane world of expectation, striking out to release something unexpected. Disbehave was accepted with critical acclaim and received notable press attention. Early Spring 2015, Worthy will release a two part remix album of Disbehave with artists including Thugfucker, Stanton Warriors, Yolanda be Cool, Matt Tolfrey, and a slough of other amazing producers. He is also back with another Dirtybird release called \"So Delicious\", among other tracks that will be due out later this year. listen to tracks here: www.soundcloud.com/worthy See my Tour dates in the About Section", "otherInfo": "A special event welcoming global superstars Gorgon City.

Her voice and songs can be heard on Christian and Country Music Radio, in the U.S. and overseas, including the UK, France, Australia, and Germany. She has been invited to perform on world stages, including the 2010 AA World Convention in San Antonio, TX, with over 60,000 people in attendance. \"When my life hit bottom over a decade ago, I felt lost, confused, and wondered why I was even breathing. But at my lowest point was where I discovered I was a songwriter! I'd never been taught how to write songs... and all these songs just started coming because of the pain I was in... songwriting became my therapy and my connection with God. As far back as I can remember, I have always LOVED singing. I sang all the time as a youngster (I'm sure I drove my parents crazy!)... I knew just about every song on Country Radio in the 70's and 80's, as well as those 50's and 60's Rock/Pop hits on my mom's old albums. But life can take its toll after a while, and sometimes what we're meant to do in life can bring the most heartache and pain. I quit singing for almost 10 years in my young adulthood, a result of getting made fun by listeners and friends. It was a sad time in my life... and I take full responsibility... It was my fault... I chose to listen to the negative voices in my life, instead of listening to my own heart. I was also suffering from scars and buried pain from severe abuse I endured earlier in my teens, and I struggled to find my identity. When my life hit bottom in my late twenties, a friend of mine invited me to a 12-step recovery group, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I had a glimmer of hope. I realized I was here on planet earth for a reason. I also realized God wasn't mad at me, but rather, He loved me, He wanted to help me, and had a plan for my life. As I began to get real and face the pain in my past and present, one day at a time, I began to discover a new purpose for my life. The leader of this 12-step recovery group asked me if I would share one of the new songs I had recently started writing. I was scared beyond words, but I sang my heart out one night in front of about 150 people. I became the Music Leader at that 12-step recovery group in Central California, and a dream that had always existed in my heart... to sing and play guitar... became a reality. God was restoring what I was meant to have, and I realized I was born to do this! I've been playing and singing at 12-step recovery programs (i.e. Celebrate Recovery), rescue missions, Teen Challenge events, coffee houses, fairs, music venues, women's events, and churches since 2001. I have been amazed to see God bring hope and encouragement to others' lives through my songs... the very songs that have helped bring tremendous healing to my own life. In 2016, we (my husband, Dennis, who is my road manager, drummer, and has also worked the 12 steps for his struggle with alcoholism), continue to share our lives and music with others. We are truly grateful and living proof that broken lives and broken people can be restored... there is always hope when God is on the scene.\" Heather's song \"Close Your Eyes\" was officially released nationwide and overseas in September 2010. It is still receiving airplay from Country Music Radio stations world-wide, and at one time was playing over 2000 times per week in the United States alone. \"Back Roads\" was released as a single in the Spring of 2011 to the UK, and landed at #20 on the Country Music Charts. Heather's music can be found on her website, under the \"Music\" Tab, iTunes, and Amazon.com. Check out Heather's song \"AMAZING GRACE\"... inspired by stories from female inmates who have endured the shame and regret of prostitution. The song can be heard under the \"Music\" tab at www.heatherlayne.com. Heather Layne's music reflects her life journey... \"I write out of my own life experiences... I also write songs about the lives of those around me... we all have a story. I believe music has a way of expressing the thoughts and feelings of thousands of people at one time, in one song. For me, that's what songwriting is all about... taking life's ups and downs and creating a song that can encourage someone else. We all need to know that we're not alone... we all need to know that there is someone out there who understands.\" - See more at: http://www.heatherlayne.com \"Heather Layne is a gift to the Body of Christ. Her message and music has become a bridge, helping those who are broken to find healing. Her ability to minister hope to both the church and the secular is real, candid and refreshing.\" - Pastors Bruce and Dori Bannister, Hillside Christian Fellowship, Hollister, CA \"Heather's music touches you. Jesus comes and sits with you through her songs. You know that there is a God of love and compassion who cares for you. Then, you look around at the people who are listening, crying, and being healed. Because Jesus changes everything, He can take the mess and make His message out of it.

Chris Rosi and Corey Cunningham had become friends when the pair toured together in their bands Plateaus and Terry Malts in 2011. By 2015 both had moved to Los Angeles where they began the band in earnest with Rosi on guitar and Cunningham on bass. After getting their sea legs playing the bars and bowling alleys of Southern California, the duo recruited engineer/drummer Jon Greene to help them commit their shambolic paeans to kiwi pop onto tape. Recorded in a disused dairy factory and mixed in mono, their self-titled debut came out on Cunningham\u2019s label Parked In Hell in February of 2017 and was reissued by Spain\u2019s Meritorio Records later that summer.\n\nAfter the passing of Jon Greene, the pair re-grouped with drummer Brice Bradley and bassist Jenny Moffett, a move that enabled Cunningham to switch to lead guitar and keyboards. The group worked tirelessly, nurturing their sound and writing batches of songs with steadfast dedication. They soon decamped to Primitive Ears, a small studio in North Hollywood, where they tracked the 10 songs that make up \u201cUsed To Yesterday.\u201d After a handful of quicksilver sessions, the group brought the tapes to producer Kyle Mullarky (The Allah-lahs) who created a final mix that really captures the band\u2019s rhythmic drive and melodic verve.\n\n\u201cUsed To Yesterday\u201d continues Smokescreen\u2019s zeal for New Zealand pop but also incorporates influences from the more melodic side of Messthetics-era DIY pop and expands into classic indie pop territory, a natural fit for the group\u2019s new label Slumberland Records. First single \u201cThe Lost Song\u201d perfectly encapsulates where the band is coming from on this new record; literally a lost demo from the group\u2019s earliest days, it is here given a NZ-meets-Athens GA arrangement, galloping along at an urgent clip and packed with guitars that strum and jangle in magical unison.\n\nWhere Smokescreens really excel is in the quality of their songwriting and the ability to incorporate a disparate set of influences while still forging their own sound and identity. The song \u201cUsed To Yesterday\u201d is classic power-pop, riding a chunky three chord riff and leavened by a bright, clanging lead. Elsewhere we find nods to The Velvet Underground (\u201cFool Me\u201d), The Clean (\u201cSomeone New\u201d) and SF\u2019s beloved The Aislers Set (\u201cWaiting For Summer\u201d). Smokescreens are such skilled writers and keen students of sound that their cover of the \u00fcber-obscure NZ band Wasp Factory\u2019s \u201cSteel Blue Skies\u201d fits in seamlessly. Album closer \u201cFalling Down\u201d could be a lost single from LA\u2019s paisley underground and definitely leaves the listener itching to hear where the band goes next.", "otherInfo": "Slumberland Records 30th Anniversary Celebration!!\n2 pm doors\n$12 adv / $15 doors"}, {"Address": "201 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Michael Barenboim", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419994, 37.777441], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: classic", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Davies Symphony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Michael Barenboim & the West-Eastern Divan Ensemble Led by concertmaster and solo violinist Michael Barenboim and comprised of Israeli and Palestinian musicians, the West-Eastern Divan Ensemble spreads the mission that opposing sides can build bridges that defy politics and encourage people to imagine a better future.

The group \u2014 who has sung openly of personal struggles related to substance abuse and body image \u2014 is holding nothing back on What\u2019s Past is Prologue, their third full length record, due out March 29, 2019 on Triple Crown Records.\n\nPast releases may have provided small glimpses into Free Throw\u2019s history as a band and personal lives outside of music, but What\u2019s Past is Prologue is the group at their most forthcoming. The 12 tracks contained on the album detail the continuing mental health struggles of lead singer Cory Castro, and serve as a complete story of what happens when you decide that everything in your life needs to change.\n\n\u201cThis album is very much about me hitting rock bottom from a mental health standpoint and the process I took in building myself back up,\u201d Castro explained. \u201cWith the last record, I was trying to talk about my mental health, but at the time I was actually going through it. The last album felt like I was yelling from the void. This time I\u2019m looking back into the void and I\u2019m able to understand what was going on.\u201d\n\nThe beautiful anguish that often comes with personal growth and an unexpected reckoning of self is palpable from the album\u2019s outset. Beginning with \u201cSmokes, Let\u2019s Go\u201d \u2014 a track of transition that features surprisingly delicate vocals and simple strings switches to impassioned shouts and furious instrumentals \u2014 Free Throw lead us out of the darkness and into the light.\n\nAs Castro explains, the record is split into two parts. The first half of What\u2019s Past is Prologue explores the weight of personal blame, with singles \u2014 including the gunning and practically unstoppable \u201cTail Whip, Struggle\u201d and the limitless, swaying tenderness of \u201cStay Out Of The Basement\u201d \u2014 setting the stage for an impactful finale. As the album nears its conclusion, \u201cToday Is Especially Delicious\u201d provides a tumultuous turning point, with the band tearing through Castro\u2019s shouted confession of \u201cIs this what I had planned for my life/I need a hand of some type to pull me up and break this cycle of drinking for breakfast.\u201d\n\nThat frank sincerity propels the album forward, and serves as a catalyst of change for the band. As a group, Free Throw has consistently turned their darkest days into moments that fans can sing and dance-along to, and for the first time, the band has arrived at this place where it\u2019s all coming together, and maybe this is really only just the beginning. \u201cThis is the first Free Throw record with a happy ending,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThe album leads to an ending of where the band stands today.

Initially working under the name \u2018Hearing Is Our Concern\u2019, he was actually the first person the newly-founded FatCat label ever received a demo from. We talked with him for a while about putting a release out, but Olivier wanted to work further on his tracks and in the end nothing happened. The name was changed to Ensemble and a chance meeting with Rephlex Records in 2000 resulted in the release of his first album, \u2018Sketch Proposals\u2019.\n\nWhile not widely released, \u2018Sketch Proposals\u2019 did gain a small, dedicated audience, not least of which included Bjork, who had the album on heavy rotation while working on her 2001 album \u2018Vespertine\u2019.

Recorded over a period of 3 years, and composed mainly in Montreal, where he now resides, Olivier travelled from Canada, to Atlanta, then to a countryside farm in French Dordogne, and finally to Berlin for his recordings, with each disparate environment absorbed into the moods of each track. Expanding on his collaborative spirit, 2006\u2019s new album (\u2018Ensemble\u2019) features beautiful vocal performances by Chan Marshall (Cat Power), Lou Barlow (Dinosaur Jr.) and UK-based Mileece, as well as drums by Adam Pierce from Mice Parade and orchestral arrangements by Johannes Malfatti, performed by the Babelsberg Film Orchestra in Germany.\n\nOlivier has also composed music for several exhibitions at the V&A museum; contributed to an Audio-Video installation by Doug Aitken at the Centre Georges Pompidou; and received an honorary mention at the Ars Electronica Festival for his noise side project, Chlorgeschlecht.", "otherInfo": "In 2020, E4TT performs our annual commissions concert on International Women's Day.

After years of dishonest living\u2014consumed by drugs, alcohol, and addiction\u2014such sincerity is jarring from the 30-year-old Chicago-based musician. Liberated from a self-destructive past and born anew in sobriety, Francis has captured an inspired collection of songs steeped in New Orleans rhythms and Chicago blues. His music evokes a bygone era of R&B\u2019s heyday while simultaneously forging a new path on the musical landscape. Ohio-based Karma Chief Records (a subsidiary of rising soul label Colemine Records) will release two songs, \u201cThese Are The Days\u201d and \u201cChanges, Pt. 1,\u201d in early 2019 with the full LP to follow in summer 2019.\n\nThere is a deep connection between Francis\u2019s childhood\u2014his obsession with boogie woogie piano, his father\u2019s gift of a dusty Dr. John LP\u2014and the songs he\u2019s created. The result is an astonishing collection of material without parallel in the contemporary funk and soul scene. The influences are unmistakable: the vocal stylings of Allen Toussaint and Leon Russell; the second line rhythms of The Meters and Dr. John; the barroom rock \u2018n\u2019 roll of The Rolling Stones; the gospel soul of Billy Preston; the roots music of The Band. Francis pays tribute to the masters but has his own story to tell: \u201cIt\u2019s the life I\u2019ve lived so far.\u201d\n\nAnd what a life it\u2019s been. Born Neal Francis O\u2019Hara, the piano prodigy found himself touring Europe by the age of 18 with Muddy Waters\u2019 son and backing up other prominent blues artists coast-to-coast. In 2012, Francis joined popular instrumental funk band The Heard. With Francis at the creative helm, The Heard transformed into a national act, touring with boogaloo progenitors The New Mastersounds and chart toppers The Revivalists and appearing at Jazz Fest and Bear Creek. As The Heard\u2019s star rose, however, Francis sunk deeper into addiction. Once a promising sideman, by 2015 he had been fired from his band, evicted from his apartment, and was perilously close to self-destruction. \u201cWhen you get close to death like that you can feel it,\u201d Francis recalls. An alcohol-induced seizure that year led to a broken femur, dislocated arm, and, finally, the realization that he needed to get clean.\n\nThe journey from a hospital bed to launching his solo career was neither predictable nor straightforward. There were musical fits and starts, relapses, and broken relationships. Yet the overwhelming passion driving Francis in this second act has been an overabundance of creative energy. \u201cDrinking held my music in a half-cocked slingshot. I was always so consumed by drugs and alcohol that I didn\u2019t have the time, money, or creative energy to do it. Sobriety let it loose.\u201d\n\nDetermined to realize the songs swirling in his head, Francis assembled a crack team of musicians, calling on bassist Mike Starr (The Heard) and drummer PJ Howard (The Revivalists, The Heard). He linked up with producer and analog-obsessive Sergio Rios (Orgone, Cee Lo Green, Alicia Keys) and self-funded a trip to Killion Sound in Los Angeles to record the initial batch of material. \u201cI learned to trust my instincts in that room,\u201d says Francis. Buoyed by classic horn arrangements and Rios\u2019 fierce guitar work, the resulting tracks illuminate a lifetime spent studying the masters of soul music.\n\nFrom the RMI electra-piano riff that kicks off \u201cShe\u2019s A Winner\u201d to the screaming organ swells of \u201cThis Time,\u201d Francis and company let it all hang out. This is fun music, dance music. Yet verse after verse and chorus after chorus, Francis wrestles with his past in a straightforward manner: \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I\u2019m not home/ I\u2019m surrounded by people, but I\u2019m really alone.\u201d Like Toussaint and Russell before him he\u2019s married the upbeat rhythms of New Orleans R&B with the lyrical approach of a confessional singer/songwriter. The refrain on \u201cThis Time\u201d serves as a foxhole prayer for a better future: \u201cLet me get it this time/I won\u2019t let you down/Let me get it this time/I won\u2019t fool around.\u201d\n\n2018 has been a busy year. In February Francis finished recording basic tracks for the yet-to-be named debut album in Los Angeles and spent the following months doing overdubs in Chicago with engineer Mike Novak (who also recorded demos for the project). After playing his first show in November, Francis was signed by Paradigm Talent Agency. He is now preparing to tour relentlessly to promote his own music. \u201cI\u2019m doing this to fulfill a drive within myself, but also to pay tribute to the gifts I\u2019ve been given. And it comes from a place of immense gratitude. I\u2019ve been given so much in my life, especially in the last two years, that this feels like a bonus.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Clairdee", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Clairdee \"A Love Letter to Lena\" Album Release"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Guest", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8275393.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "There are 2 Bands that have the name \"Guest\" :\n\n1) Guest is a duo of two siblings, Brittany and Brandon Hargest (formally of Jump5).

Davina Sowers and the Vagabonds have created a stir on the national music scene with their high-energy live shows, level A musicianship, sharp-dressed professionalism, and Sowers\u2019 commanding stage presence. With influences ranging from Fats Domino and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to Aretha Franklin and Tom Waits, the band is converting audiences one show at a time, from Vancouver to Miami and across Europe. In 2011 Davina released her first full length, all original album Black Cloud . It was named one of the 10 best releases of the year by the Minneapolis Star & Tribune and awarded 4 \u00bd stars from Downbeat Magazine. Their next release in 2014, Sunshine, hit number 13 in the Billboard Blues Chart and led them to be a musicial feature on the hit BBC show, Later with Jools Holland. DATV\u2019s shows are filled with New Orleans charm, Memphis soul swagger, dark theatrical moments that evoke Kurt Weill, and tender gospel passages. Davina\u2019s voice and stage presence defy category in a different way. Davina has been compared to Etta James, Amy Winehouse, Janis Joplin, Billie Holiday and Betty Boop, but comparisons don\u2019t suffice: Sowers is a true original. Bringing you 100 years of American music and Davina\u2019s originals, which lend themselves to the American Songbook, the band brings edgy nostalgia to older generations and fresh new music to younger ears. This rollicking quintet is held together by Sowers\u2019 keyboard playing, with acoustic bass, drums, and a spicy trumpet and trombone horn section. The group\u2019s focused, clean sound and emphasis on acoustic instruments is novel to both blues and jazz worlds, and sets the show closer to New Orleans than to Chicago. This has set the Vagabonds apart at festivals in Thunder Bay, Ontario; Sighisoara, Romania; Sierre, Switzerland; Kemi, Finland; the 2012 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and 2013 Monterey Jazz Festival ( in 2014 was asked back to play their main stage in 2014, Vache de Blues in France, and North Sea Jazz Festival.

But, Davina & the Vagabonds, a Minneapolis-based quintet driven by New Orleans horns and the campy purr of vocalist/pianist Davina Sowers, carry it off with such aplomb that you won\u2019t miss the usual six-string histrionics one bit.Listening to Davina & the Vagabonds is like stepping into a wondrous musical time machine.

It seems unlikely that much power is coming from the slight frame of one Ms. Davina. It sounds like an unnatural force, pulled from some secret spot in the belly no other singer has yet discovered. It\u2019s a low bellow, most closely aligned with Amy Winehouse\u2019s walloping alto. But Davina takes \u201cretro\u201d back further than Winehouse and her Phil Spector reminiscing. She beckons an age when bad girls wore red lipstick and pin curls.

She was influential in the birth of punk rock with her 1975 debut album Horses which was produced by John Cale. Called \"Godmother of Punk\" she integrated the beat poetry performance style with three-chord rock. Smith is most widely known for the song Because the Night, which was co-written with Bruce Springsteen and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978. In 2005 Patti Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, and in 2007 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nSmith was born in Chicago. Her mother, Beverly, was a jazz singer, and father, Grant, worked at the Honeywell plant. She spent her entire childhood in Woodbury, New Jersey. Raised the daughter of a Jehovah's Witness mother, she claims she had a strong religious education and a very good Bible education, but left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining and much later wrote the opening line of her cover version of Them's \"Gloria\" in response to this experience. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964. The family was not wealthy and Smith went to work in a factory.\n\nIn 1967 she left Glassboro State Teachers College (now Rowan University) and moved to New York City. She met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe there while working at a book store with friend, poet Janet Hamill. Mapplethorpe's photographs of her became the covers for the Patti Smith Group LPs, and they remained friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989. In 1969 she went to Paris with her sister and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to New York City, she lived in the Hotel Chelsea with Mapplethorpe; they frequented the fashionable Max's Kansas City and CBGB nightclubs. The same year Smith appeared with Wayne County in Jackie Curtis's play \"Femme Fatale\". As a member of the St. Mark's Poetry Project, she spent the early '70s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed \u2013 for one night only \u2013 in Sam Shepard's \"Cowboy Mouth\". (The published play's notes call for \"a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow\".) She collaborated with Allen Lanier of Blue \u00d6yster Cult, who recorded several of the songs to which Smith had contributed, including \"Debbie Denise\" (after her poem \"In Remembrance of Debbie Denise\"), \"Career of Evil\", \"Fire of Unknown Origin\", \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\", and \"Shooting Shark\". During these years, Smith also wrote rock journalism, some of which was published in Creem magazine.\n\nBy 1974 Patti Smith was performing rock music herself, initially with guitarist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and later with a full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl, on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia, fleeing in 1968 after the fall of Alexander Dub\u010dek. Financed by Robert Mapplethorpe, the band recorded a first single, \"Hey Joe / Piss Factory\", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard with the addition of a spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst (\"Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women...\"). The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations.\n\nPatti Smith Group was signed by Clive Davis of Arista Records, and 1975 saw the release of Smith's first album \"Horses\", produced by John Cale amidst some tension. The album fused punk rock and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of Van Morrison's \"Gloria\", and Smith's opening words: \"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine.\" The austere cover photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe has become one of rock's classic images. As Patti Smith Group toured the United States and Europe, punk's popularity grew. The rawer sound of the group's second album, \"Radio Ethiopia\", reflected this. Considerably less accessible than Horses, Radio Ethiopia received poor reviews. However, several of its songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them regularly in concert. On January 23, 1977, while touring in support of the record, Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida and fell 15 feet into a concrete orchestra pit, breaking several neck vertebrae. The injury required a period of rest and an intensive round of physical therapy, during which time she was able to reassess, re-energize and reorganize her life. Patti Smith Group produced two further albums before the end of the 1970s. \"Easter\" (1978) was her most commercially successful record, containing single \"Because the Night\" co-written with Bruce Springsteen. \"Wave\" (1979) was less successful, although songs \"Frederick\" and \"Dancing Barefoot\" both received commercial airplay.\n\nBefore the release of Wave, Smith, now separated from long-time partner Allen Lanier, met Fred Sonic Smith, former guitar player for Detroit rock band MC5 and his own Sonic's Rendezvous Band, who adored poetry as much as she did. (\"Wave\"'s \"Dancing Barefoot\" and \"Frederick\" were both dedicated to him.) The running joke at the time was that she only married Fred because she would not have to change her name. Patti and Fred had a son, Jackson, and later a daughter, Jesse. Through most of the 1980s Patti was in semi-retirement from music, living with her family north of Detroit in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. On June 1988 she released album \"Dream of Life\", which included song \"People Have the Power\". Fred Smith died on November 4, 1994. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the unexpected death of her brother Todd and original keyboard player, Richard Sohl. When her son Jackson turned 21, Smith decided to move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her to go back out on the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe).\n\nIn 1996, Smith worked with her long-time colleagues to record the haunting \"Gone Again\", featuring \"About a Boy\", a tribute to Kurt Cobain. Smith was a fan of Cobain, but was more angered than saddened by his suicide. That same year she collaborated with Stipe on \"E-Bow the Letter,\" a song on R.E.M.'s \"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\", which she has also performed live with the band. After release of \"Gone Again\", Patti Smith has recorded two new albums: \"Peace and Noise\" in 1997 (with the single \"1959\", about the invasion of Tibet) and \"Gung Ho\" in 2000 (with songs about Ho Chi Minh and Smith's late father). A box set of her work up to that time, \"The Patti Smith Masters\", came out in 1996, and 2002 saw the release of \"Land (1975\u20132002)\", a two-CD compilation that includes a memorable cover of Prince's \"When Doves Cry\". Smith's solo art exhibition, \"Strange Messenger\" was hosted at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh on September 28, 2002.\n\nOn April 27, 2004 Patti Smith released \"Trampin'\" which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith's mother who died two years before. Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of \"Horses\" in its entirety. Guitarist Tom Verlaine took Oliver Ray's place. This live performance was released later in the year as \"Horses/Horses\". In August 2005 Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Arthur Rimbaud and William Blake. On July 10, 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In addition to her influence on rock music, Minister also noted Smith's appreciation of Arthur Rimbaud. On October 15, 2006, Patti Smith performed at CBGB nightclub, with a 3\u00bd-hour tour de force to close out Manhattan's music venue. She took the stage at 9:30 p.m. (EDT) and closed for the night (and forever for the venue) at a few minutes after 1:00 a.m., performing her song \"Elegie\", and finally reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years.\n\nSmith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame March 12, 2007. She dedicated her award to the memory of her late husband, Fred, and gave a performance of The Rolling Stones classic \"Gimme Shelter\". As the closing number of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Smith's \"People Have the Power\" was used for the big celebrity jam that always ends the program. From March 28 to June 22, 2008 the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain in Paris is hosting a major exhibition of the visual work of Patti Smith, \"Land 250\", drawn from pieces created between 1967 and 2007. At the 2008 Rowan Commencement ceremony, Smith received an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture. Smith is the subject of a 2008 documentary film, \"Patti Smith: Dream of Life\".\n\nwww.pattismith.net\nMySpace", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Monday February 24"}, {"Address": "1025 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "A Bowie Celebration", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9394900.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.415665, 37.803702], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bimbo's 365 Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Rotciv", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Return Of The Cypher (No Cover) Hip Hop, Bands, Rap Battles"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Herband", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Patti Smith and her band w/ Oliver Ray"}, {"Address": "San Jose, CA", "Artist": "J.Stalin", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.8261, 37.2751], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Back Bar Sofa", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors: 9:00 pm / Show: 10:00 pm, 21+"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Patti Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8656541.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "Patricia Lee Smith (born December 30, 1946 in Chicago) is an American singer-songwriter, poet and artist.

William Reames and Willard Logan both picked up the guitar at an early age, took lessons from the same teacher in town, went to the same school, and even played in the same middle school band together.\n\nA shared love for bluegrass, folk, and singer/songwriter music sparked a different musical friendship for Reames between him and banjo player, Barton Davies. Before long, the two youngsters enthusiastically bounced songs off each other and discovered some of their favorite bands like The Steel Drivers, John Hartford, and The Infamous Stringdusters together. In no time at all, they were writing and performing songs of their own, an at the age of 16, they formed their own band. Only, they needed a mandolin player. That's when they called Logan - and the two longtime friends, and now, Davies, were bandmates once again.\n\n\"We were still too young to step foot inside a bar when we first started to play,\" Davies recalls, \"so we'd set up shop on the sidewalk outside of Robert's Western World in downtown Nashville and play our own songs for whomever would listen.\" According to Davies - about halfway through one of their sets, a man came stumbling out of Robert's, got in Barton's face and yelled \"play that thing, Banjo Boy! Faster now, ya hear? C'mon, Banjo!\"\n\nReames texted Davies later that night - \"Boy Named Banjo.\"\n\nWith a brand new band name and a bunch of original songs, the trio recorded The Tanglewood Sessions, an honest, emotional, roots-driven look into the lives of the young outfit. Unexpectedly, the debut album was received quite well and now has over 3 million streams on Spotify.\n\nIn 2013, BNB invited drummer Sam McCullough to join the group, before recording its sophomore album, Long Story Short (2014). The band got its first breakthrough by earning a spot on the 2015 Bonnaroo lineup, which led to some hometown love for the native Nashvillians, including a nomination for Best Local Band by The Tennesseean. Shortly after releasing Lost on Main EP in 2015, Boy Named Banjo found its missing piece - Ford Garrard (bass), hit the road, and hasn't stopped touring since.\n\nBoy Named Banjo's sound has grown up alongside them into an energetic blend of rock, folk-pop, and alt-country that will keep listeners smiling, clapping, and dancing along for many years to come. You won't want to miss what they have have been cooking up for 2018.

First and foremost, I was a fan, being fortunate to see them play live many times over the last ten years (yes ten years!! Where did that go?) and continually they astonish at how much they give. Playing each and every time as if their lives depended on it. If you\u2019ve never seen them live, I urge you to please make the effort. Trust me, it\u2019ll stay with you forever.\n\nSimply, they\u2019re four funny, generous and extremely grounded blokes who still can\u2019t believe their luck and who continually strive for brilliance, but now a decade in it\u2019s time for us to take stock and celebrate just how much their music has shadowed and enriched our daily lives. Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, I give you, the wondrous Keane.\u201d\n\n----\n\nNot many British bands these days have more than one big-selling album, let alone five. Fewer still manage to replicate - and maintain - that success outside the UK. And only a tiny number are able to continually develop their sound as their career progresses. But, in the last decade, Keane have achieved all of those things and a whole lot more. After selling over 11 million copies of their five consecutive Number One records, with their four award winning albums and their 8 track EP \u2018Night Train\u2019, it is no exaggeration to say that Keane are firmly established as one of the world's most successful, innovative and cherished bands.\n\nWhen Keane first got together all those years ago, three of the bands they most admired were the Beatles, Radiohead and Blur. What made all of those acts special was that although nobody could ever predict what they'd do next, you knew it would be worth hearing. Over the release of their five albums that's an exclusive club to which Keane have surely now gained membership.\n\nTracklisting for \u2018The Best Of Keane\u2019 below, revealing the story of one of the biggest bands of the decade;\n\nTrack 1. Everybody\u2019s Changing\n\n1997, Battle, Hastings, seaside small-town England. Keane, a struggling trio from the aptly-named Battle, take five years to be discovered \u201covernight\u201d in December 2002 at the Betsey Trotwood pub, east London, by Simon Williams, founder of the atom-sized though astronomically influential Fierce Panda label. Signed in 2003, that year is dominated by America, a glitzy showbiz caterwaul of Black Eyed Peas, Beyonc\u00e9, Avril Lavigne, Justin Timberlake, Eminem and Christina Aguilera. The quintessentially British Keane, by comparison (also championed by Radio 1's Steve Lamacq) wear their hearts on their vulnerably-fraying sleeves and release debut independent single \u2018Everybody's Changing\u2019 in April 2003 before signing to the mighty Island major and releasing world-class epic piano-rock anthem \u2018Somewhere Only We Know\u2019 in early 2004. Debut album \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019 follows, an instantaneous, British rock phenomenon, a soaring rapture of euphoric melancholy which swathes the planet. A UK No.1 album, Keane bloom in a brand new landscape, a post-Britpop era of emotional sensitivity, which dominates the rest of the decade.\n\n\u201cWe're the post-OK Computer generation,\u201d notes Tim Rice-Oxley, Keane's gifted songwriter, lyricist and pianist, of the '97 Radiohead classic. \u201cFor me, that was the album of our generation. We've grown up appreciating the power of a song that can unlock you. And we're all men, I guess, who probably wouldn't otherwise let go. That's our cornerstone. It's just good to feel you're not alone.\u201d\n\nTrack 2. Somewhere Only We Know\n\n2006-2012, four more albums, four heroically different directions. Post \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019, Keane detonate their own blueprint. Like Blur and Radiohead, they've the confidence to diversify: through \u2018Under The Iron Sea\u2019 (2006, portentous document of splintering inter-band relationships), \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 (2008, ambitious experiment in conscience-rock and glittering electro-pop, recorded in Berlin), the \u2018Night Train\u2019 EP (further sonic experiments and lyrical ennui, recorded on the road) and \u2018Strangeland\u2019 (2012, piano-rock progressions on a rousing, reflective sojourn through human relationships and what it means to be 30-something men). \u2018The Best Of Keane\u2019, therefore, is more than just a greatest hits (and there's plenty of them): a compendium of Classic Keane Anthems plus band favourites, fan favourites, live favourites and two new tracks (\u2018Higher Than the Sun\u2019, \u2018Won't Be Broken\u2019), featuring the stunning hymnal \u2018Hamburg Song\u2019 and the glorious reverie \u2018My Shadow\u2019. To date Keane have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, their five albums to date consecutive UK No.1s.\n\n\u201cI'm very proud of the variety on the \u2018Best Of\u2019,\u201d notes Tim. \u201cYou've got the Keane anthems, then something like \u2018Hamburg Song\u2019 which is deeply emotional. \u2018Atlantic\u2019 is weird, sonically ambitious. Same with \u2018Spiralling\u2019 (voted 2008 Song Of The Year by Q magazine). \u2018Silenced By The Night\u2019 covers my craving for American open highway epic rock songs. It's hasn't just been \u2018Somewhere Only We Know\u2019 times sixteen. There's a lyrical reflection of our lives and the way they've changed, in a really true way.\u201d\n\nTrack 3. Bend and Break\n\n2012, Brazil. Tom Chaplin, a man whose astonishingly powerful archangel vocals puncture the human heart with a shard of purest yearning, awakes in a hotel bed. He's poleaxed, once again, by the malady which typifies the global touring colossus Keane have long become: stratospheric jet lag. \u201cI had literally no sense of self,\u201d he boggles. \u201cI couldn't have told you what my name was, what day it was, what year it was.\u201d\n\nTrack 4. Bedshaped\n\n700 shows in over 40 countries worldwide. Keane have now played in over forty individual countries: America, Russia, South America, Indonesia, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Japan, all across Europe, over and over again. In South Korea they're known as The Autumn Band with all the wistful melancholy, melodic richness and emotional metamorphosis that implies. Their fans unfurl 'Welcome' flags in trees outside their hotels, tattoo their art-work and lyrics on their bodies, hold birthday parties in their honour, in Brazil (when they're not even in Brazil) and send lengthy letters saying their music has \u201csaved my life\u201d. Keane are a universal soul band.\n\nTrack 5. This Is The Last Time\n\n2004, Glastonbury. Newly back from their inaugural tour of America, Keane had left a Britain where their biggest-ever show was at The Forum, Kentish Town (capacity 2,000). \u201cWe got to Glastonbury and 20 thousand people were singing all our songs, it was electrifying,\u201d beams Tim. \u201cBefore that, we had no sense whatsoever what it was like for our music to be everywhere.\u201d\n\nTrack 6. Atlantic\n\n2005, Madison Square Gardens, New York City. Keane support U2 over five nights and Larry Mullen Jnr, shows Keane drummer Richard Hughes how he sets his kit up (with a view to minimising injury). \u201cOne of my absolute heroes,\u201d marvels Rich. \u201cAnd I'm sitting at his drum kit, at Madison Square Gardens. Mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nTrack 7. Is It Any Wonder?\n\nAt the core of Keane lies a precious creative affinity, a vocal gift which interprets emotional music with a stunning synchronicity. \u201cIt's very rare,\u201d notes Tom, \u201cthat both a singer and song-writer have that, together.\u201d Tom feels he can sing like this because he battles, as all proper singers do, \u201cinsecurity, vulnerability and fear of the world, coupled with the ability to stand in front of thousands of people and pour it all out: those two extremes are the beating heart of most singers\u201d. No wonder fellow artists love them: Paul McCartney, Pharrell Williams, Bono, Lily Allen, John Mayer, Nicole Scherzinger, Chris Martin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gwen Stefani, Zach Braff, novelist Brett Easton Ellis, Kanye West and Snoop Dogg.\n\nTrack 8. Nothing In My Way\n\nApril 2013, BBC Radio 2, London. \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019 is voted No.2 in the 100 Favourite Albums Of All Time by listeners of the UK's mighty Radio 2. Nothing stands in their way (apart from Coldplay at No.1), beating their all-time heroes: Simon & Garfunkel, Bruce Springsteen, The Beatles, REM, U2, Abba...\n\n\u201cTen years down the line and our vulnerability has been our saving grace,\u201d decides Tom. \u201cIt's something that can't be affected by changing fashions. Because that's a human truth.\u201d\n\nTrack 9. Hamburg Song\n\n2008, Germany. Keane love Germany, especially Berlin. \u201cA city which has picked itself up time and time again is so inspirational,\u201d says Tim. \u201cIts history, its creativity, its innovation, its spirit of reconciliation, is also the spirit of the band.\u201d They recorded third album \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 at Teldex Studios in Berlin.\n\nTrack 10. Crystal Ball\n\n2006 onwards, everywhere. As well as old-school universal songwriters, Keane are new-school pioneers: one of the first bands ever to release a single on a USB stick (\u2018Nothing In My Way\u2019, 2006): an acoustic gig on the Great Wall of China (in conjunction with the innovative Burberry, 2011): the first band to stream a 3D live show. \u201cNot bad,\u201d notes Rich, \u201cfor a band who started out playing The Crypt in Hastings.\u201d\n\nTrack 11. A Bad Dream\n\n2005, Helioscentric Studios, Rye, Sussex. Keane record second album \u2018Under The Iron Sea\u2019, lyrically much of which is political and social comment on the modern world, songs such as \u2018A Bad Dream\u2019 and \u2018Is It Any Wonder?\u2019 question the heroics of war. These themes are also present on some of the following album \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 in songs \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 and \u2018Better Than This\u2019 for example. In 2007 the band become War Child ambassadors and curate a night at Brixton Academy in aid of the charity, featuring Pet Shop Boys, Lily Allen and Guillemots amongst others.\n\nTrack 12. Try Again\n\n2012, Japan. Tom knows more than most what it's like to try again. \u201cThe good old days didn't really work for me, \u201cI didn't really appreciate how brilliant everything was, in the beginning,\u201d muses the ever-philosophical Tom. \u201cI don't think I was grown up enough, then.\u201d he laughs, over breakfast in Japan. \u201cBut now I feel the happiest I've ever felt. In my whole life.\u201d\n\nTrack 13. Spiralling\n\nFrom the very beginning. Of a decade's extraordinary moments, Tim cherishes the ones with his band mates most. \u201cI've a photo on my sitting room wall where we're in Brazil just completely pissing ourselves, basically,\u201d he smiles. \u201cThat for me is the ultimate. Such a simple thing. Being with my friends, laughing, a lot.\u201d\n\nTrack 14. Perfect Symmetry\n\nArt, always. Keane know how to collaborate, choosing dazzling minds to enhance their singular vision: novelist/force of nature Irvine Welsh (director of the foreboding Atlantic video, 2006), graphic designer Sanna Annukka (the dynamic swirls of the Under The Iron Sea art-work), artist Osang Gwon (the life-size, photo-montage sculptures for the Perfect Symmetry art-work). They've met a myriad heroes on what Tom calls \u201cThe Celebrity Thrill Ride at Disneyland\u201d. In 2011, a \u201cbabbling\u201d Tim met all-time hero Paul Simon two nights in a row, \u201cand his security guard clearly had me earmarked as a potentially dangerous nutter\u201d. In 2011 in Glasgow, they had a backstage photo-op with Paul McCartney, Tim\u2019s greatest hero other than Paul Simon. \u201cWe were stood in line and I thought, I'll let Tim stand next to him,\u201d remembers Jesse Quin, Keane's live bass player turned full-time member in 2011. \u201cAnd Paul McCartney shoved him out the way, pulled me next to him and said (comedy Liverpudlian) \u201cus bass players have gorra stick together, man!\u201d. \u201cTim won't let me forget it.\u201d In 2010, Tom sang with Queen at the Albert Hall, introduced by Brian May with the words: \u201cNo-one's sung this song since Freddie sang it, because they haven't been able to.\u201d\n\nTrack 15. My Shadow\n\n2004. Novelist William Boyd (currently penning the new James Bond novel) has enjoyed, in Keane, a curiously symbiotic connection: in their early years Keane wrote the song \u2018Any Human Heart\u2019, inspired by Boyd's novel of the same name. Never released, word filtered back to the writer anyway who was newly besotted with \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019, beguiled by Tom's \u201cethereal, plangent voice\u201d and Tim's \u201cmelodic generosity that was astounding in contemporary British rock\u201d. William and Tim became friends, by 2012 both individually plundering East Sussex/West Kent for creative inspiration, for the \u2018Strangeland\u2019 album and the \u2018Waiting For Sunrise\u2019 novel. A short story ensued, named after the \u2018Strangeland\u2019 single \u2018Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\u2019 (published on the deluxe CD sleeve-notes). \u201cKeane,\u201d wrote Boyd in a celebratory appraisal in the Guardian in 2012, \u201care a great British band.\u201d\n\nTrack 16. Silenced By The Night\n\n2006/7, Under The Iron Sea Tour, everywhere. Rich sits behind his drum-kit, transfixed, as Tom sings \u2018Try Again\u2019, the staggeringly plaintive piano dreamscape which doesn't require much drumming. \u201cAnd every night I would almost forget to come back in because I was lost, listening,\u201d he remembers. \u201cTom just does it night after night, absolutely beautifully. A remarkable singer.\u201d\n\nTrack 17. Disconnected\n\n\u201cIt sounds pretentious but the whole culture of Keane, to a lot of people, is a vitally positive thing,\u201d decides Tim. \u201cIt's definitely something real. We're brave and honest in our songs and people respond to that. Whether it's teenagers grappling with adulthood, people getting divorced, people stuck in war zones, they find, somehow, inspiration and comfort in our music.\u201d\n\nTrack 18. Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\n\n1980s. As kids in the 80s, the boys who would be Keane drank fizzy drinks in the Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9, Bexhill-on-Sea. As men in 2008, they drank fizzier drinks in Schwarzes Caf\u00e9, Berlin, the 24-hour bar where Keane relaxed most nights, sometimes 'til 6am. For the first time in his life, Tim felt he was truly \u201cliving the dream\u201d.\n\nTrack 19. Higher Than The Sun\n\nNovember 2013, everywhere. Keane's first-ever \u2018Best Of\u2019 is released this November, both a glorious celebration of one of Britain's best-loved bands and a soaring testament to the power of melodic rapture. The jury is in: from the magical, perennial alchemy of melancholy and beauty, this is undeniable evidence of Keane's considerable contribution to the sum of human happiness.\n\n\u201cIt's a classic thing in music, isn't it?\u201d decides Tim. \u201cAll the people I love, most of their songs have a melancholy tint, if not very dark. And yet their music makes you happy. People can get very serious about music. But at Keane gigs, everyone's smiling. Even if you're singing about heartbreak, confusion and desperation. Being able to connect with people, that's really all we care about.\u201d\n\nTrack 20. Won't Be Broken\n\nThe Future. As Keane's five No.1 albums attest, they've never faltered. Tim Rice-Oxley remains ambitious, focused, hungry.\n\n\u201cI think there is an undeniable quality to what we've achieved so far,\u201d he decides. \u201cBut it's in my nature to also feel that there's more we could do. One of those great albums of all time which you don't appreciate until you're older, with the extra wisdom you don't have when you're young. I've had my own ups and downs and feel like I'm just approaching the point where I could write an album like that. The richness is beginning to come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all just want to feel connected, don't we?\u201d concludes Tom, of the power of Keane's singularly emotive music. \u201cTo the world. To each other. I hope if we've done anything we've given people a sense that the world is not such a huge scary place as it can sometimes seem. That we are all in it together. To the end. So you might as well try and understand what it is to be a human being, while we're all here.\u201d", "otherInfo": "There is a delivery delay until 2/24/20."}, {"Address": "255 S Almaden Blvd, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Il volo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7166897.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.89192, 37.33001], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "Genres: Progressive Rock, International, Italian, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "San Jose Center for the Performing Arts", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "65 Capp St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Andrea von Kampen", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8182577.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418409, 37.765783], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Revival, Americana, Acousic, Indie, Folk, Singer, Songwriter, Traditional Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lost Church", "moreBioInfo": "\"We were completely blown away.\" -NPR All Songs Considered\n\nAndrea von Kampen is an independent folk singer-songwriter based in Lincoln, Nebraska, whose effortless vocal delivery has been praised by Hear Nebraska as \u201csoulful and worn-in.\u201d With the successful release of two EP\u2019s, Another Day (2015) and Desdemona (2016), a Christmas EP (2016), an Audiotree Live album (2017), and her debut full-length album Old Country (2019), Andrea has quickly established herself in the recording studio and on the road. She has shared the stage with artists such as Tall Heights, Ira Wolf, Dead Man Winter, The Brother Brothers, Dead Horses, Darling West and many more.\n\nOld Country, Andrea von Kampen\u2019s debut full-length album, was released on February 8th, 2019. The album was recorded and mastered in Nebraska and features exclusively Nebraska-based musicians. Inspiration for Andrea\u2019s songs often come from literature, art, and nature; in particular the literature and nature of Nebraska and the Midwest. The title track, Old Country, is based on the book \u201cMy \u00c1ntonia\u201d by Nebraska author Willa Cather.\nHer single, Portland, received notable attention including features on The Bluegrass Situation, Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. Additionally, Amazon Music Canada featured Portland in their \u2018Top Songs of 2018\u2019 playlist. In a review of Portland, Ear To The Ground Music said, \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about where you\u2019re going, but that you want to get away. That emotion of \u201cidealistic escapism\u201d is one that listeners can all connect with, whether or not we want to go to Oregon or somewhere else.

They had new ideas on how to explore and develop their music. After some member hunting and rehearsals CoL had its first line-up consisting of: Klas Rydberg, Johannes Persson, Magnus Lindberg, Erik Olofsson and Fredrik Renstrom. After a short period of time, Fredrik had to leave due to some personal difficulties.\n\nWhen practice started to pay off, CoL recorded a two-track demo in January 1999. After some more rehearsals, the band felt that to fully live out their wet dream of sound experimenting, an additional member was needed to handle the electronics. Since Magnus had both knowledge and equipment, he was an obvious choice. Given that Magnus had handled the drums earlier they needed a new drummer, who they found in the mutual friend Marco Hilden. A new bass player was also found, named Axel Stattin. Another mutual friend helped CoL release their first record. Tim Bertilsson, head of Trust No One Recordings released a 7\" split vinyl with his own band Switchblade.\n\nWatching a concert at the Trastock Festival, year 2000, UK label Rage of Achilles got in contact with CoL. Pretty soon after that it was agreed that RoA was to release CoL's debut full-length album. Release date was September 14th 2001. In these days Hydra Head Records had also shown interest in CoL, and this co-operation resulted in a two-track 7\" colored vinyl on HHR, released March 24th 2002. These two songs were recorded at the same time as the self titled full-length on RoA. Immediately after the release of the first album, news of the band's mammoth sound worked its way into cult circles and the band received rave reviews. Discerning listeners instantly appreciated the bands unique approach, trading light and dark to create music that hit the heart and the head in equal measures.\n\nAfter the success of the first album, Earache Records contacted CoL and wanted to sign a record deal. After some negotiations CoL finally signed the contract. Immediately after that CoL entered Tonteknik Recording studios, in July 2002, to record their second album The Beyond. After the recording session Andreas Johansson joined in on bass, due to the departure of Axel Stattin. The Beyond was released February 10th 2003, to critical acclaim. CoL proved that they were now ready to bring their soundscapes to a much wider audience. After the release of The Beyond, CoL toured Sweden with The Haunted and the UK with Isis. After this the line up changed, drummer Marco Hilden was replaced by Thomas Hedlund and an additional keyboard player, Anders Teglund, was added as a permanent fixture. Magnus took care of the percussion and additional guitar parts.\n\nAt this point touring became a lot more frequent. Late summer 2003 CoL ventured into Europe with US hardcore sensations Poison the Well, to amazing press reactions. In December the same year CoL returned to the UK for a tour with art noise merchants The Dillinger Escape Plan. The early part of 2004 was mostly dedicated to writing songs for their follow up to The Beyond. They found the time to play a few long awaited shows in Sweden and Finland, before entering Tonteknik Recording studios once again in April 2004.\n\nThe recording of Salvation was done in three different sessions, thus enabling the band to take some rest and think about possible changes that needed to be done. Finally, in late July 2004 the album was complete. Salvation was released October 4th 2004 in Europe and Oct 19th in the US. This album marked a new era in the history of CoL, both visually and sonically. At the same time as Salvation was hitting the stores, CoL embarked on a Europe/UK headline tour, which also included Scandinavian dates. This tour introduced a new member, Fredrik Kihlberg, who joined in on percussion and clean vocals.\n\n2005 was perhaps the most interesting year so far in the history of CoL. It started with a six week European tour, partly with American hardcore act Bleeding Through and partly by their own. This tour also saw a change in the live line-up. As Thomas couldn\u0092t participate due to being busy playing with other bands, Magnus took over the live drumming. When the band came home they had the time to rest for about a month before departing to the US for the first tour over there. CoL supported the mighty Mastodon on the first leg of the tour, and headlined eight shows (supported by Breather Resist) on the latter part. The reception of the American audience was stunningly good for a first ever tour in the US. After the US-tour CoL did some Scandinavian and European festival shows before starting to work on the 4th full-length album Somewhere Along The Highway.\n\nIn November 2005 CoL began the recording of Somewhere Along The Highway. The first session was located to an old octagon barn ten minutes west of Umea. The vibe out there was perfect and seven days were spent there recording basic tracks. After some more sessions in the studio environment, Magnus mixed the last song in January 2006. Somewhere Along The Highway was released April 24th 2006 on Earache Records, followed by a European/UK headline tour.", "otherInfo": "Cult of Luna"}, {"Address": "155 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Gaucho", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7519822.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.405592, 37.796778], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Acoustic, Swing", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Comstock Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "Gaucho is a masterful Bay Area band that combines the influence of gypsy jazz of 1930\u2019s Europe with the rhythmic drive and collective improvisation of New Orleans swing music, gutbucket blues and elements of ragtime.

William Reames and Willard Logan both picked up the guitar at an early age, took lessons from the same teacher in town, went to the same school, and even played in the same middle school band together.\n\nA shared love for bluegrass, folk, and singer/songwriter music sparked a different musical friendship for Reames between him and banjo player, Barton Davies. Before long, the two youngsters enthusiastically bounced songs off each other and discovered some of their favorite bands like The Steel Drivers, John Hartford, and The Infamous Stringdusters together. In no time at all, they were writing and performing songs of their own, an at the age of 16, they formed their own band. Only, they needed a mandolin player. That's when they called Logan - and the two longtime friends, and now, Davies, were bandmates once again.\n\n\"We were still too young to step foot inside a bar when we first started to play,\" Davies recalls, \"so we'd set up shop on the sidewalk outside of Robert's Western World in downtown Nashville and play our own songs for whomever would listen.\" According to Davies - about halfway through one of their sets, a man came stumbling out of Robert's, got in Barton's face and yelled \"play that thing, Banjo Boy! Faster now, ya hear? C'mon, Banjo!\"\n\nReames texted Davies later that night - \"Boy Named Banjo.\"\n\nWith a brand new band name and a bunch of original songs, the trio recorded The Tanglewood Sessions, an honest, emotional, roots-driven look into the lives of the young outfit. Unexpectedly, the debut album was received quite well and now has over 3 million streams on Spotify.\n\nIn 2013, BNB invited drummer Sam McCullough to join the group, before recording its sophomore album, Long Story Short (2014).

She was influential in the birth of punk rock with her 1975 debut album Horses which was produced by John Cale. Called \"Godmother of Punk\" she integrated the beat poetry performance style with three-chord rock. Smith is most widely known for the song Because the Night, which was co-written with Bruce Springsteen and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978. In 2005 Patti Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, and in 2007 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nSmith was born in Chicago. Her mother, Beverly, was a jazz singer, and father, Grant, worked at the Honeywell plant. She spent her entire childhood in Woodbury, New Jersey. Raised the daughter of a Jehovah's Witness mother, she claims she had a strong religious education and a very good Bible education, but left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining and much later wrote the opening line of her cover version of Them's \"Gloria\" in response to this experience. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964. The family was not wealthy and Smith went to work in a factory.\n\nIn 1967 she left Glassboro State Teachers College (now Rowan University) and moved to New York City. She met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe there while working at a book store with friend, poet Janet Hamill. Mapplethorpe's photographs of her became the covers for the Patti Smith Group LPs, and they remained friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989. In 1969 she went to Paris with her sister and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to New York City, she lived in the Hotel Chelsea with Mapplethorpe; they frequented the fashionable Max's Kansas City and CBGB nightclubs. The same year Smith appeared with Wayne County in Jackie Curtis's play \"Femme Fatale\". As a member of the St. Mark's Poetry Project, she spent the early '70s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed \u2013 for one night only \u2013 in Sam Shepard's \"Cowboy Mouth\". (The published play's notes call for \"a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow\".) She collaborated with Allen Lanier of Blue \u00d6yster Cult, who recorded several of the songs to which Smith had contributed, including \"Debbie Denise\" (after her poem \"In Remembrance of Debbie Denise\"), \"Career of Evil\", \"Fire of Unknown Origin\", \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\", and \"Shooting Shark\". During these years, Smith also wrote rock journalism, some of which was published in Creem magazine.\n\nBy 1974 Patti Smith was performing rock music herself, initially with guitarist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and later with a full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl, on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia, fleeing in 1968 after the fall of Alexander Dub\u010dek. Financed by Robert Mapplethorpe, the band recorded a first single, \"Hey Joe / Piss Factory\", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard with the addition of a spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst (\"Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women...\"). The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations.\n\nPatti Smith Group was signed by Clive Davis of Arista Records, and 1975 saw the release of Smith's first album \"Horses\", produced by John Cale amidst some tension. The album fused punk rock and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of Van Morrison's \"Gloria\", and Smith's opening words: \"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine.\" The austere cover photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe has become one of rock's classic images. As Patti Smith Group toured the United States and Europe, punk's popularity grew. The rawer sound of the group's second album, \"Radio Ethiopia\", reflected this. Considerably less accessible than Horses, Radio Ethiopia received poor reviews. However, several of its songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them regularly in concert. On January 23, 1977, while touring in support of the record, Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida and fell 15 feet into a concrete orchestra pit, breaking several neck vertebrae. The injury required a period of rest and an intensive round of physical therapy, during which time she was able to reassess, re-energize and reorganize her life. Patti Smith Group produced two further albums before the end of the 1970s. \"Easter\" (1978) was her most commercially successful record, containing single \"Because the Night\" co-written with Bruce Springsteen. \"Wave\" (1979) was less successful, although songs \"Frederick\" and \"Dancing Barefoot\" both received commercial airplay.\n\nBefore the release of Wave, Smith, now separated from long-time partner Allen Lanier, met Fred Sonic Smith, former guitar player for Detroit rock band MC5 and his own Sonic's Rendezvous Band, who adored poetry as much as she did. (\"Wave\"'s \"Dancing Barefoot\" and \"Frederick\" were both dedicated to him.) The running joke at the time was that she only married Fred because she would not have to change her name. Patti and Fred had a son, Jackson, and later a daughter, Jesse. Through most of the 1980s Patti was in semi-retirement from music, living with her family north of Detroit in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. On June 1988 she released album \"Dream of Life\", which included song \"People Have the Power\". Fred Smith died on November 4, 1994. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the unexpected death of her brother Todd and original keyboard player, Richard Sohl. When her son Jackson turned 21, Smith decided to move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her to go back out on the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe).\n\nIn 1996, Smith worked with her long-time colleagues to record the haunting \"Gone Again\", featuring \"About a Boy\", a tribute to Kurt Cobain. Smith was a fan of Cobain, but was more angered than saddened by his suicide. That same year she collaborated with Stipe on \"E-Bow the Letter,\" a song on R.E.M.'s \"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\", which she has also performed live with the band. After release of \"Gone Again\", Patti Smith has recorded two new albums: \"Peace and Noise\" in 1997 (with the single \"1959\", about the invasion of Tibet) and \"Gung Ho\" in 2000 (with songs about Ho Chi Minh and Smith's late father). A box set of her work up to that time, \"The Patti Smith Masters\", came out in 1996, and 2002 saw the release of \"Land (1975\u20132002)\", a two-CD compilation that includes a memorable cover of Prince's \"When Doves Cry\". Smith's solo art exhibition, \"Strange Messenger\" was hosted at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh on September 28, 2002.\n\nOn April 27, 2004 Patti Smith released \"Trampin'\" which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith's mother who died two years before. Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of \"Horses\" in its entirety. Guitarist Tom Verlaine took Oliver Ray's place. This live performance was released later in the year as \"Horses/Horses\". In August 2005 Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Arthur Rimbaud and William Blake. On July 10, 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In addition to her influence on rock music, Minister also noted Smith's appreciation of Arthur Rimbaud. On October 15, 2006, Patti Smith performed at CBGB nightclub, with a 3\u00bd-hour tour de force to close out Manhattan's music venue. She took the stage at 9:30 p.m. (EDT) and closed for the night (and forever for the venue) at a few minutes after 1:00 a.m., performing her song \"Elegie\", and finally reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years.\n\nSmith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame March 12, 2007. She dedicated her award to the memory of her late husband, Fred, and gave a performance of The Rolling Stones classic \"Gimme Shelter\". As the closing number of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Smith's \"People Have the Power\" was used for the big celebrity jam that always ends the program. From March 28 to June 22, 2008 the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain in Paris is hosting a major exhibition of the visual work of Patti Smith, \"Land 250\", drawn from pieces created between 1967 and 2007. At the 2008 Rowan Commencement ceremony, Smith received an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture. Smith is the subject of a 2008 documentary film, \"Patti Smith: Dream of Life\".\n\nwww.pattismith.net\nMySpace", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Monday February 24"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Whitacre", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9927306.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Rock, Folk", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "With over 500,000 streams on Spotify, sold out shows with Mt.

With her thoughtful narrative voice, Palehound singer/songwriter Ellen Kempner imbues each song on the album with a radical sensitivity, an unchecked depth of feeling that ultimately sparks a greater open-heartedness within the listener.\n\nCo-produced by Kempner and Gabe Wax (Beirut, Soccer Mommy), Black Friday follows 2017\u2019s A Place I\u2019ll Always Go\u2014a widely acclaimed release that landed on many year-end best-of lists. In creating the album, Kempner and her bandmates Jesse Weiss (drums) and Larz Brogan (bass) recorded at Panoramic House in Stinson Beach, California, tracking most of the songs live and breathing a new vitality into Palehound\u2019s elegantly detailed sound.\n\nUnrestrained in emotion but subtle in sonic flourish, Black Friday opens with the stripped-back intensity of \u201cCompany,\u201d the first of many songs conveying a profound longing for a lost friend. From there, Palehound shift into the joyful wonder of \u201cAaron,\u201d a song Kempner wrote for her partner in the midst of his transitioning process. \u201cIt\u2019s about the past year of him coming out and me helping him through that, and just watching him grow so much,\u201d she says. With her hushed yet urgent vocals, Kempner reveals her ability to draw so much power from a single word, turning \u201cAaron\u201d into an indelibly tender expression of devotion and love.\n\nPalehound examine the intricacies of friendship and partnership all throughout Black Friday, handling the subject with a level of attention rarely found in pop songs. On the quietly hypnotic title track, Kempner captures the specific ache of uneven emotional investment between friends, framing her plaintive acceptance in particularly barbed lyrics (\u201cYou\u2019re Black Friday and I\u2019m going to the mall\u201d). And on \u201cWorthy,\u201d Palehound speak to the challenge of navigating self-confidence issues in relationships, and delicately showcase Kempner\u2019s lyrical finesse (\u201cAnd I\u2019ve won over your mother, darling/And I\u2019ve won over your sister too/And I won over your father, darling/And I still don\u2019t feel worthy of you\u201d).\n\nWhile much of Black Friday unfolds with palpable compassion, \u201cKiller\u201d takes on a vengeful mood as Kempner recounts a fantasy of doing away with a friend\u2019s abuser. \u201cIt came from being so fed up with people who feel like they can take advantage of others sexually or physically or emotionally to get ahead or get what they want, and just wanting to destroy that culture in general,\u201d she says. On the following track, Palehound continue their contemplation of abuse with \u201cWhere We Live\u201d\u2014a striking piece of spoken word from New York City-based poet Melissa Lozada- Oliva; its gritty yet dreamlike storytelling set against Kempner\u2019s sprawling guitar work.\n\nIn bringing Black Friday to life, Kempner spent much of her time holed up in the practice space she shares with a wrestling troupe, pursuing a songwriting process that\u2019s often emotionally fraught. \u201cFor me songs usually start with some really strong anxiety or other bad emotion,\u201d says Kempner. \u201cI generally don\u2019t pick up a guitar when I\u2019m feeling super-happy.\u201d Originally from Connecticut, she first started writing songs at age 10, several years after taking up guitar. \u201cMy dad wrote songs and played guitar and we\u2019re really close, so I always felt inspired to make music too,\u201d she notes. After playing in a punk band in high school, Kempner began putting out songs under the name Palehound at age 18, then released the project\u2019s debut EP Bent Nail in 2013 and full-length debut Dry Food in 2015. Arriving in June 2017, A Place I\u2019ll Always Go earned praise from outlets like Pitchfork (who hailed Kempner\u2019s voice as \u201cspecific and visceral\u201d) and NPR (who stated that Palehound\u2019s \u201cunflinching songs are also a celebration of life and embrace of love, and an empathetic reflection on how endings usually lead to beginnings\u201d).\n\nWith Black Friday building off the emotional complexity of its predecessor, Palehound hope that the album might help others to work through their own troubles in life and love of all kinds. \u201cMaking music\u2019s always been a therapeutic thing for me\u2014that\u2019s such a big part of the reason why I do it in the first place,\u201d says Kempner. \u201cWhat I always want to do with my songs is to help people heal in some way, or come to some new understanding about whatever it is that they\u2019re going through. Even if it\u2019s just hearing a song and feeling less alone than they were before, that would mean so much to me.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Santa Rosa, CA", "Artist": "Johanna Warren", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8280195.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.7144, 38.4405], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Acoustic, Folk, Songwriter", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Tree House", "moreBioInfo": "/// keeping it real \\\\\\", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "647 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Jim McVeigh", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10238127.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421378, 37.762505], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Standup Comedy, Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Valencia Room", "moreBioInfo": "Jim McVeigh is a stand up comic based in the SF Bay Area", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Shopping", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9876559.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Post Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "S.H.O.P.P.I.N.G.....We're shopping", "otherInfo": "SHOPPING\nAutomatic\nNaked Roommate\n8 pm\n$15 adv / $17 doors\nAll Ages"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Neoma", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9163224.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Latin Alternative, Alternative Pop, rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Neoma has captivated music lovers all over the world with her dreamy yet energetic \u201cLunar Pop\u201d hits.

This is the path that lead songwriter and multi-instrumentalist-turned-producer, Andrew Vait, to Little Wins. His Seattle powerhouse duo, SISTERS, was formed in 2014 and has enjoyed a four-year run of small victories; opening for Allen Stone at Chateau Ste Michelle within their first four live shows; appearing on the main stages of Sasquatch! Music Festival, Capitol Hill Block Party and NYC Pride; their song, Buck, was placed in a national Toyota ad campaign; and they are now signed to Tender Loving Empire - a boutique record label in Portland, OR.\n\nAfter SISTERS\u2019 first tour of Europe concluded in late 2017, Vait discovered that a surplus of emotions from world-travel (and subsequently returning to the American hotbed of dispiriting political affairs) produced a proportionate surplus in creativity, and, being a student of social justice, Vait began writing songs with a new narrative. Where \u201cjoy as an act of revolutionary defiance in the face of oppression\u201d defines SISTERS, Vait is now carefully considering his complicity in systems of oppression as a white male in the music industry, and he is retracing his own family lines, which includes battles with clinical depression and addiction. Taking major influence from WOC artists; namely, Solange, SZA, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Vait seeks to honor and pay tribute to the black artists who have shaped modern music and culture. He stands tall among other white artists who have followed in similar footsteps - Francis and the Lights, Bon Iver, James Blake, Steve Winwood, Peter Gabriel, to name a few.\n\nAfter writing the bedrock of songs that would become the first Little Wins singles, Vait shared a handful of demos with his friend, Nate Mercereau, who produces and records with the likes of Jay-Z, Leon Bridges, and John Legend. Mercereau persuaded Vait to explore additional production elements and encouraged him to finish the recordings on his own. Armed with a MacBook Air, a MIDI controller, and a Shure SM7b, Vait, who plays guitar, piano, saxophone, flute, clarinet, and drums, and has extensive experience with analog synthesizers, turned Garageband (his DAW at the time) inside-out and produced his first two singles, almost exclusively utilizing Garageband instruments. He brought the tracks to Andy Park (engineer/producer for Pedro The Lion, Ciara, Noah Gundersen), and together, they finished the mixes.\n\nThe lead single, Let Me Into Your Heart, is about recognizing and facing fear; struggling to find a home and a voice while celebrating small victories, like the warmth of the sun and conquering despair.

That's the story of Ricky Skaggs. By age twenty-one, he was already considered a \"recognized master\" of one of America's most demanding art forms, but his career took him in other directions, catapulting him to popularity and success in the mainstream of country music. His life's path has taken him to various musical genres, from where it all began in bluegrass music, to striking out on new musical journeys, while still leaving his musical roots intact.\n\nRicky struck his first chords on a mandolin over 50 years ago, and this 15-time Grammy Award winner continues to do his part to lead the recent roots revival in music. With 12 consecutive Grammy-nominated classics behind him, all from his own Skaggs Family Records label (Bluegrass Rules! in 1998, Ancient Tones in 1999, History of the Future in 2001, Soldier of the Cross, Live at the Charleston Music Hall, and Big Mon: The Songs of Bill Monroe in 2003, Brand New Strings in 2005, Instrumentals in 2007, Salt of the Earth with The Whites in 2008, Honoring the Fathers of Bluegrass: Tribute to 1946 and 1947 in 2009 and Ricky Skaggs Solo: Songs My Dad Loved along with Mosaic in 2010), the diverse and masterful tones made by the gifted Skaggs come from a life dedicated to playing music that is both fed by the soul and felt by the heart.\n\n2018 was a stellar year for Skaggs, with the addition of three more Hall of Fame inductions: the National Fiddler Hall of Fame, IBMA\u2019s Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and country music\u2019s greatest honor, the Country Music Hall of Fame. Along with his three previous inductions into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Association\u2019s Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Musicians Hall of Fame, all six awards display his ability to masterfully cross genres with versatility in styles and instruments.\n\nRicky Skaggs has often said that he is \"just trying to make a living\" playing the music he loves. But it's clear that his passion for bluegrass puts him in the position to bring this lively, distinctively American form of music out of isolation and into the ears and hearts of audiences across the country and around the world. Ricky Skaggs is always forging ahead with cross-cultural, genre-bending musical ideas and inspirations.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Eric Nam", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620080.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Eric Nam"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Frenship", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9027877.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Pop, Electro Pop, Electronic", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "Our Debut EP \"Truce\" available now: smarturl.it/FRENSHIPEP", "otherInfo": "Eric Nam"}, {"Address": "1192 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Underground Nomads", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.410074, 37.775296], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "f8", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Underground Nomads\" w/ rotating resident DJs Amar, Sep, and Dulce Vita, plus guests"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Junior Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Salami Rose Joe Louis", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club Crystal Cavern", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jazz Night with Joe Lyle (New Orleans) and Salami Rose Joe Louis! 9-12AM every Tuesday!"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Joe Lyle", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9126562.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Afro-Beat, Punk, Afro-Cuban, Indie, Afro-Brazilian, Funk", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Seisiun", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.460518, 37.783375], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Plough & Stars", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Seisi\u00fan at Plough & Stars: Throwing back pints to a live soundtrack of traditional jigs and reels gives this Richmond watering hole a notably authentic Irish feel.

She would, they would hammer out danger and a warning all over the land.

These Californians have more in common with the dirty haired, dirty fingernailed folk groups of the nascent years than they do any of their contemporaries. They're suited for reminiscent hopefulness and the gracefully youthful fusion of hostility and all-encompassing passion for all things that can set a smile ablaze or turn the hairs on arms and backs of necks into little beds of nails at the flick of a switch. They make lists of things they like, including all of the people they love, their home, pretty girls, desserts, bodies of water, justice and America. They believe there's still hope for it and in all of the rooms contained within the hallways of the band's newest offering, \"Ode To Sunshine,\" they make you understand that, when it's all boiled down, what we all ultimately live for is catharsis and a fulfillment of body meeting land, air and sea harmoniously. They're about bodies meeting bodies, pressing skins to skins. They're about reminding you to listen more than you talk. They're about urging you to put stock in the happiness of others, not just your own. They make it obvious that we have to go somewhere to be somewhere. We have to feel something to really live.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Unlovely, the third full length album from Calin \"Callie\" Peters (vocals, cello, bass), Martin Earley (vocals, guitar), and Devin Mauch (vocals, percussion), isn't about the complete absence of beauty. Instead, the eleven tracks on The Ballroom Thieves latest LP are a sonic encapsulation of emotional and political dissonance, the constant state of discomfort that's enveloped the world for the past few years.\n\n\"We write about the things that are important to us and right now, it's impossible to ignore the inadequate state of the world,\" says Earley. \"We just wrote the songs that came out of us and they happened to be largely political.\" He continues, \"In an ideal world, we would never write a political record-there'd be nothing extreme enough to warrant it.\"\n\nTackling subjects as weighty as greed, inequality, privilege, and narcissism, and as light as fulfillment and adoration, Unlovely offers a track for every occasion, whether you're furious, depressed, exhausted, or hopeful. Songs like \"Homme Run\" and the title track boil over with exasperation and disgust, rage and resentment running through every line in protest of today's global status quo. Others like \"Love is Easy\" and \"Tenebrist\" turn the focus inward onto doubts of purpose and identity.\n\nAs their first album entirely co-written by Peters and Earley, save for Peters' song \"Pendulum,\" Unlovely is a tangible reflection of their evolution from band members to life partners. \"Figuring out how to write as a writing team has been something of an adventure,\" says Earley. \"We used to create songs more separately but found that we complement each other well in almost every sense of the word, including songwriting. Most of the songs I brought to the table were inspired by our dreadful news cycle but tend to involve some sort of hopeful or romantic spin, whereas most of Callie's songs are about smashing the patriarchy and destroying evil forever.\"\n\nSongs like \"Begin Again\" and the Gilberto & Getz-influenced \"Don't Wanna Dance\" serve as a window into Peters' perspective, someone who is, as she says, \"smiling through\" regardless of how difficult and frustrating that facade is to maintain. \"I began writing a few years ago, and when I started, it felt like I opened up this whole verbal world in my head,\" says Peters. \"For a while, I thought that by writing all the time, I was perpetuating my pain, but over time, I've found a way to use words to help ease my mind.\"\n\n\"I wrote a lot of the lines while sitting in the van and having a difficult time as we drove past nondescript highways,\" she says, adding that while some of her notes were unintelligible, others were crafted with more poetic intentions. \"I hope that by getting some of my thoughts down, I could show someone lonely that there might be one other human in the world who feels like they do.\"\n\nIncorporating musical styles that range from Motown to classic rock and metal, Unlovely maintains the recognizable, nostalgia-tinged sound of The Ballroom Thieves' previous outputs while pushing a heightened brashness. Since the release of their first EP and debut full-length, A Wolf in the Doorway, The Ballroom Thieves have consistently and skillfully crossed genres, joining artists like Caamp, Langhorne Slim and Shakey Graves to bridge the gap between folk, rock and soul. With Unlovely, thanks in part to frequent collaborator Ariel Bernstein, the trio took it a step further and grew their instrumental arsenal, amplifying their signature energy and eccentricity. \"Ariel has been a great friend of ours for years now,\" says Earley. \"He's a talented musician, engineer, and unlicensed band therapist, so when we decided to expand our touring party, he was the unanimous first round draft pick.\"\n\nEngineered and produced by Jerry Streeter (Brandi Carlile, The Lumineers, Vance Joy), Unlovely was recorded in and around the northeast, predominantly at HearStudios in Camden, Maine.\n\nIt's their unique brand of powerful and harmonious music, while never shying away from topics and ideas they are passionate about that has charmed fans around the country. Their catalogue has amassed over 85 million streams and they've gained a loyal live following, selling out shows and earning festival spots at Boston Calling, Newport Folk, Moon River, Mountain Jam, and Calgary Folk.

Founders Jeremy Belzer and Mike Hoffman actually formed the project in Southern India by way of travel throughout their relative lives from Kansas City, Portland, Los Angeles, Ghana, Thailand, Korea, China, India eventually settling in the Bay Area and completing the 5-piece live band with the addition of Ty Parker on drums, Joey Hassid on synths and David Monzon on guitar.\n\nJeremy chased the arts and was awarded a scholarship to CalArts taking 1st place in a nationwide painting competition. He spent nights listening to records in the library and wound up majoring in Music Composition. After college, he decided to take to the world with his laptop, guitar and microphone and wrote and recorded hundreds of songs while living in the jungles of Thailand, seeking higher consciousness in India, and sweating in tiny apartments in Korea and China.\n\nMike, a drummer since the age of 10, dropped out after his first year of music school to travel to West Africa and study with a Master tribal drummer in rural Ghana. Mike played heavily in the local African and Afro-pop scene upon returning home, later moving to LA to finish his education at CalArts. It was there that he was turned on to writing and producing music, making his first solo album on an 8-track tape recorder.\n\nMusic became the driver and underneath their syncopated, multi-layered rhythmic arrangements, Panic Is Perfect writes simple indie pop songs with meaningful lyrics and melodies that stay with you long after the songs end. Sharing vocals, Mike and Jeremy sway the listener in and out of catchy vocal and melodic hooks, danceable beats and textures that reflect their well-travelled global tastes and influences.

Even so, his songcraft commands the utmost respect. Ford is no one trick pony. Keyboardist Johnny Neel once said: \u201cMarc Ford\u2019s an actual genius. He has the best guitar sound I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s career began in Los Angeles during the 1980s. His group, Burning Tree, captured the essence of his guitar virtuosity and songwriting.\n\nHe joined the Black Crowes in late 1991. Ford toured and recorded on three of the Crowes\u2019 finest albums--The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, Amorica, and Three Snakes and One Charm. Ford\u2019s tenure in the Crowes found the group operating at a zenith. He rejoined the Crowes in 2005-2006 when they toured and released The Lost Crowes--two albums the band never released when he was a member.\n\nIn 2002, Ford released his first solo album, It\u2019s About Time. During this era, Ford experienced the highs and lows of surviving in a cutthroat music business through the years as well as being a dedicated family man. Ford\u2019s following solo albums included Weary And Wired (2007), The Fuzz Machine (2010) and Holy Ghost (2014).\n\nFord won a NAACP award (John F. Kennedy counts as one of the few other Caucasians bestowed the honor) for his work on the Ben Harper and Blind Boys of Alabama album There Will Be A Light.\n\nAlso, Ford\u2019s role as a record producer allowed him to use his gift of tone and a powerful ability to listen. Artists he produced include Ryan Bingham, Pawnshop Kings, Steepwater Band, Chris Lizotte, Phantom Limb and Republique du Salem. Marc Ford exists as a musical architect of the highest order.\n\nThrough his career Marc Ford has performed and recorded with Izzy Stradlin, Gov\u2019t Mule, The Jayhawks, The Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers, Federale, Widespread Panic, Blue Floyd, Booker T. Jones, Ivan Neville and Heartbreaker Mike Campbell.\n\nThe group on The Vulture, The Neptune Blues Club, recorded their debut album in 2009, which charted at #15 for two weeks on the blues charts. This versatile ensemble includes Mike Malone (vocals, harp, keys), John Bazz (bass), Anthony Arvizu (drums) and Ford. Mr. Ford unleashes his hypnotic guitar skills on these soulful tunes.\n\nThe Vulture was recorded on analog tape at mastermind John Vanderslide\u2019s Tiny Telephone Studios located in the mission district of San Francisco. The Vulture emits Ford\u2019s greatest strengths: soulful musicianship, memorable songs and an emotive groove.\n\nFord explained the ethos of these new compositions: \u201cIf Holy Ghost was Sunday morning, then The Vulture is Saturday night\u2026\u201d\n\nThe opening track--\u201dDevil\u2019s In the Details\u201d--emerges as one of Ford\u2019s finest. The tune operates in his electric wheelhouse. He\u2019s like Clint Eastwood with a guitar. The well-crafted \u201cThe Same Coming Up\u201d clocks in at one minute and fifty seconds emitting joyous rock n roll. \u201cAll We Need To Do Is Love\u201d eases the listener into pastoral reflection. \u201cThis Ride\u201d inspires reckless abandon. The title track contains Ford\u2019s signature snakebite guitar work as he delivers a savage truth in the lyrics: \u201cGot a head full of diamonds/And a nose full of snow/You leave a trail of destruction/Everywhere that you go/Got a shrug of the shoulder/For all that you stole.\u201d\n\n\u201cArkansas Gas Card\u201d stands as one of the group\u2019s stellar numbers that transfers with brilliance to a live audience. \u201cOld Lady Sunrise\u201d travels into sonic backwaters of a low-country swamp like some vintage STAX Records jewel. The gospel-laced \u201cDeep Water\u201d explores redemptive sanctuaries where matters of the soul are at stake.\n\n\u201cShalimar Dreams\u201d augments a gritty R&B, rock-n-roll magic in a mesmerizing sound that surrounds the listener. The last cut, \u201cGirl of Mine\u201d, is a love song Ford sings and provides steel on as the group provides a sparse, yet concise musical backdrop.\n\nIt\u2019s harvest time for Marc Ford. Over the years he\u2019s created his own stellar sound that meets all the rigid standards of excellence. The Vulture represents another timeless volume in Marc Ford\u2019s inimitable musical journey...\n\n2017 saw the birth of Marc's new focus, a project called The Magpie Salute, which also features former Black Crowes Rich Robinson and Sven Pipien.

It\u2019s dreams and queer feeling, and it\u2019s for you not them.\n\n\nIn a scene where abstruse lyrics and ironic detachment are all the rage, Alien Boy\u2019s high-stakes, loud pop is as refreshing as it is surprising. In the grand tradition of emo and pop-punk\u2014and perhaps rock \u2019n roll in general\u2014lead singer and songwriter Sonia Weber uses her songs to communicate subdued desires and secret grievances. Alien Boy\u2019s debut LP Sleeping Lessons is a collection of lullabies for the pop masochist; like all good, emotional music, Weber\u2019s songs are resonant because they\u2019re unmistakably human.\n\n\nAlien Boy takes their name from a Wipers song, but elsewhere the group\u2019s PNW lineage is felt in a mordant grit gleaned from Team Dresch and early Heatmiser. It sets the tone for Weber to mix her deep-seated love of early 2000's generational touchstones with a Britpop frostiness to brilliant and totally unique results\u2014from the tremolo dives and Stone Roses references on Ride-y opener \u201cSomewhere Without Me\u201d, to the sun-kissed, sub-three-minute power pop bliss of \u201c600 Days\u201d. Weber\u2019s melodies are so bright and effective it\u2019s easy to forget they come from a place of absolute emotional torment. (Mo Troper)\n\n\n\u201cSince 2015, Portland, Oregon\u2019s Alien Boy has been establishing itself as one of the most intriguing guitar rock bands in the American underground. Its sound could be roughly described as a mixture of pop-punk, post-punk and shoegaze. The jangle-y riffs and melt-y, fiery tones propelled by urgent rhythms could certainly be considered to be an amalgamation of all of those styles of music. But Sonia Weber\u2019s vocals, expressive, poignant, unafraid to go off of conventional and sanitized melodies anchors the songs in relatable human experiences which aren\u2019t ever perfect. But that willingness to embrace flaws is its own perfection by speaking to emotional truth and it\u2019s what makes Alien Boy more compelling than many bands that seem to write music where everything is ultimately okay. This band\u2019s music isn\u2019t about bravado, it\u2019s about being real and honest with oneself and others.\u201d Queen City Sounds and Art (2019)\n\n\n\u201cAlien Boy\u2019s debut LP, Sleeping Lessons, wastes no time letting you know what you\u2019re in for. Like the panicked swirls that introduce the Cure\u2019s Pornography or the dense rush that yanks listeners into My Bloody Valentine\u2019s Loveless, the plangent cry of overlapping guitars in the first minute of \u201cSomewhere Without Me\u201d erases uncertainty: There are heavy feelings here, and they will devastate.\u201d - Portland Mercury (2018)\n\n\n\u201cA lot of bands do the punk/shoegaze thing now, but not that many of them have a singer who\u2019s as much of a force as Sonia. Sleepy bedroom-recorded shoegaze singing this is not; Sonia belts like she\u2019s already ready to play huge rooms, and she does it without ever falling into radio-rock bombast.\u201d - Brooklyn Vegan (2018)\n\n\n\u201cGeorge Harrison reportedly wrote most of his legendary triple LP, All Things Must Pass, while he was still in the Beatles\u2014a story that typifies the secretly prolific sideperson mythos. While the comparison is extreme, Sonia Weber has been one of the most sought-after Portland musicians in the punk community for almost a decade (even serving a brief stint in Ben Barnett's emo vanity project Kind of Like Spitting in 2012). But she hadn't really stepped up to the mic prior to the formation of her new band, Alien Boy\u2014a noisey, vaguely gothic take on early '00s pop-punk. The band's debut, Never Getting Over It, is so confidently realized and covers such a large sonic palette that it's hard to believe the band is so young.\u201d - Portland Mercury (2015)", "otherInfo": "GREAT GRANDPA\nAlien Boy\nPllush\n7 pm\n$13 adv / $15 doors\nAll Ages"}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "MAE.

She is known for her virtuosic technique, energetic live performances and blend of musical genres such as jazz, progressive rock, classical and fusion in her compositions. She performs as a trio alongside bassist Tony Grey and drummer Martin Valihora. On October 19, 2006, the trio added guitarist David Fiuczynski (from the Screaming Headless Torsos), to form Hiromi's Sonicbloom. Hiromi's official website is located at http://www.hiromimusic.com.\n\nHiromi first mesmerized the jazz community with her 2003 Telarc debut, Another Mind. The buzz started by her first album spread all the way back to her native Japan, where Another Mind shipped gold (100,000 units) and received the Recording Industry Association of Japan's (RIAJ) Jazz Album of the Year Award. The keyboardist/composer's second release, Brain, won the Horizon Award at the 2004 Surround Music Awards, Swing Journal's New Star Award, Jazz Life's Gold Album, HMV Japan's Best Japanese Jazz Album, and the Japan Music Pen Club's Japanese Artist Award (the JMPC is a classical/jazz journalists club). Brain was also named Album of the Year in Swing Journal's 2005 Readers Poll. In 2006, Hiromi won Best Jazz Act at the Boston Music Awards and the Guinness Jazz Festival's Rising Star Award. She also claimed Jazzman of the Year, Pianist of the Year and Album of the Year in Swing Journal Japan's Readers Poll for her 2006 release, Spiral. Hiromi continues her winning streak as Hiromi's Sonicbloom with the 2007 release of Time Control and her 2008 release of Beyond Standard.\n\nBorn in Shizuoka, Japan, in 1979, Hiromi took her first piano lessons at age six. She learned from her earliest teacher to tap into the intuitive as well as the technical aspects of music.\n\n\"Her energy was always so high, and she was so emotional,\" Hiromi says of her first piano teacher. \"When she wanted me to play with a certain kind of dynamics, she wouldn't say it with technical terms. If the piece was something passionate, she would say, 'Play red.' Or if it was something mellow, she would say, 'Play blue.' I could really play from my heart that way, and not just from my ears.\"\n\nHiromi took that intuitive approach a step further when she enrolled in the Yamaha School of Music less then a year after her first piano lessons. By age 12, she was performing in public, sometimes with very high-profile orchestras. \"When I was 14, I went to Czechoslovakia and played with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra,\" she says. \"That was a great experience, to play with such a professional orchestra.\"\n\nFurther into her teens, her tastes expanded to include jazz as well as classical music. A chance meeting with Chick Corea when she was 17 led to a performance with the well-known jazz pianist the very next day.\n\n\"It was in Tokyo,\" Hiromi recalls. \"He was doing something at Yamaha, and I was visiting Tokyo at the time to take some lessons. I talked to some teachers and said that I really wanted to see him. I sat down with him, and he said 'Play something.' So I played something, and then he said, 'Can you improvise?' I told him I could, and we did some two-piano improvisations. Then he asked me if I was free the next day. I told him I was, and he said, 'Well, I have a concert tomorrow. Why don't you come?' So I went there, and he called my name at the end of the concert, and we did some improvisations together.\"\n\nAfter a couple years of writing advertising jingles for Nissan and a few other high-profile Japanese companies, Hiromi came to the United States in 1999 to study at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. For as open as her musical sensibilities had already been when she came to the U.S., the Berklee experience pushed her envelope even further.\n\n\"It expanded so much the way I see music,\" she says. \"Some people dig jazz, some people dig classical music, some people dig rock. Everyone is so concerned about who they like. They always say, 'This guy is the best,' 'No, this guy is the best.' But I think everyone is great. I really don't have barriers to any type of music. I could listen to everything from metal to classical music to anything else.\"\n\nAmong her mentors at Berklee was veteran jazz bassist Richard Evans, who teaches arranging and orchestration. Evans co-produced Another Mind, her Telarc debut, with longtime friend and collaborator Ahmad Jamal, who has also taken a personal interest in Hiromi's artistic development. \"She is nothing short of amazing,\" says Jamal. \"Her music, together with her overwhelming charm and spirit, causes her to soar to unimaginable musical heights.\"\n\nAt 26, Hiromi stands at the threshold of limitless possibility, constantly drawing inspiration from virtually everyone and everything around her. Her list of influences, like her music itself, is boundless. \"I love Johann Sebastian Bach, I love Oscar Peterson, I love Franz Liszt, I love Ahmad Jamal,\" she says. \"I also love people like Sly & The Family Stone, Dream Theater and King Crimson. Also, I'm so much inspired by sports players like Carl Lewis and Michael Jordan. Basically, I'm inspired by anyone who has big, big energy. They really come straight to my heart.\"\n\nBut she won't, as a matter of principle, put labels on her music. She'll continue to follow whatever moves her, and leave the definitions to others.\n\n\"I don't want to put a name on my music,\" she says. \"Other people can put a name on what I do. It's just the union of what I've been listening to and what I've been learning. It has some elements of classical music, it has some rock, it has some jazz, but I don't want to give it a name.\"", "otherInfo": "Hiromi No pianist alive imbues the solo piano format with more explosive virtuosity or thrilling unpredictability than Hiromi Uehara \u2013 a GRAMMY-winning artist the All Music Guide calls \u201cone of the most remarkable pianists of the past half century.\u201d A prodigious talent who debuted with the Czech Philharmonic at 14, the Hamamatsu, Japan native was mentored by Chick Corea and Ahmad Jamal early in her development, signing her first record deal with Telarc before graduating from Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music."}, {"Address": "1658 Excelsior Ave, Oakland, CA 94602", "Artist": "Hannah Levy MUSIC", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10093836.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.222088, 37.801866], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Vocal, Funk, R&B, Jazz, Balkan, Harmony Group", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "St Paul Lutheran Church", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Led by Larry Gordon, Northern Harmony is the highest level performing group under the umbrella of the Vermont based world music organization Village Harmony.

It was here that the collective took shape, grew together, and set about creating their unique style of instrumental music.\n\nSoon thereafter, High Pulp entered the studio to record their debut album Bad Juice, released in June 2018. Featuring 8 tracks, this album whisks the listener on a Bad-Juice-induced stupor of euphoria and narcosis, all the while inducing subconscious head-bobbing.\n\nNow, High Pulp is feverishly producing their next wave of releases. Their Light Fix EP (November 2019) brought vocalists into High Pulp\u2019s extended musical family for the first time, featuring guest appearances by three R&B/soul singers and KEXP favorites: JusMoni, Falon Sierra and Shaina Shepherd (BEARAXE).\n\n\u201cHigh Pulp\u2019s infusion of soul-based hiphop, R&B, and funk cannot be missed\u201d - The Stranger\n\n\"Seattle\u2019s fusion big band High Pulp\u2019s debut... answers the new millennium\u2019s post-trip-hop, -indie, -ambient, -drum & bass, etc. contemporary with vinyl sharp grooves, macram\u00e9 arrangements, and session-level instrumentation\" - Earshot Jazz\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t many bands making music like this right now\u201d - What\u2019s Up!

Each of these artists joined in writing and recording a track with High Pulp, and together the three tracks formulate the Light Fix EP (released Fall 2019).\n\nIn 2020, the story of MUTUAL ATTRACTION continues, with a series of releases in partnership with Portland-based Dutch Records.

Mordred were formed back in 1984 in the San Francisco Bay Area during the era that gave us the big 4: Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax & Megadeth. One of the first bands in the cross over thrash metal genre, They released their debut album Fools Game back in 1989. Fool's Game gave birth to the hit single Everyday\u2019s A Holiday, a huge crowd pleaser at the live shows; it also yielded a video which played in heavy rotation on MTV & other music stations internationally in addition to helping secure a successful American/European tour supporting the likes of Sacred Reich, Overkill, Nuclear Assault and Celtic Frost. In 1991 came their second album, In This Life, which garnered 5 star reviews like Kerrang magazine's https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1389669184606211.1073741830.1377819649124498&type=3 This album spawned 2 hit singles, Falling Away & Esse Quam Videri. Both videos for the singles enjoyed heavy rotation on MTV and worldwide. Touring for support of In This Life produced a live home video, In This LIVE, from one of their amazing headlining shows at the Marquee club in London which sold out both nights. 1992 arrived & Mordred release the 6 track EP that was Vision. The EP included a wide variety of the crossover thrash sound & again enjoyed lots of radio exposure. The band are pleased to announce that it is the line-up that is responsible for the In This Life & Vision records that has reformed. The line-up comprises of: Scott Holderby--vocals James Sanguinetti--guitars Danny White--guitars Art Liboon--bass Aaron (Pause) Vaughn--keyboards, vocals, turntables Jeff Gomes--drums On October 20, 2013, Mordred created their official Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/MordredBand and a few days later, they announced a reunion with the \"In This Life\" lineup.

Then they moved around a lot. They write stories that may revolve around shady characters down on their luck, brothels with an eccentric clientele, or a scorned woman out for revenge. These stories are delivered with sultry female vocals and jazz accompaniment reminiscent of a bygone era. In 2008, Tumbledown House won the 4th annual Singer/Songwriter competition held in Livingston, Montana. After winning the competition, the duo began recording their self-titled debut album, which was released in the summer of \u201909. In the fall of 2009, Tumbledown House embarked on a full U.S. tour to promote their debut album, and went on to share the stage with the likes of Crooked Still, The Dodos, The Devil Makes Three, Keller WIlliams, Elephant Revival, Laura Gibson with Musee Mecanique, and The Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Since then, the band has circled the country another couple of times, toured the South in the spring of 2012 and has toured Alaska once or twice a year for several years now. The duo hunkered down in northern Arizona for a spell where the lawlessness and the cheap booze were fine fodder for a second album. With the help of Lady Luck, they got 3 members of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band on the album and found themselves on the road again. These days, the duo is putting down roots in San Francisco and loving the festive citizenship that abounds there. Whenever possible, they play with a full band of rotating talented characters, and continue to meet up with past band mates whenever on the road, just to see what kind of trouble they can get into.

James quit school in grade 10 and moved to Vancouver in 1980. While trying to hook up with musicians there, he managed to open for Stevie Ray Vaughan for a show back in Regina. Vaughan was quite impressed with Colin's performance and subsequently took James on the road for several tour dates in the USA.\n\nIt was Stevie Ray Vaughan who gave Colin James his stage name.

Stories help you find your people!\n\n\u2764 Kinky sex has been one of Race Bannon\u2019s passions as a practitioner, organizer, writer, educator, commentator, activist and leader since his first explorations of the leather world starting in 1973. Race\u2019s accomplishments include co-founder of the Kink Aware Professionals referral service; leader of The DSM Project that began to change how psychotherapy professionals view kink; author of the bestselling Learning The Ropes: A Basic Guide to Safe and Fun BDSM Lovemaking; founder of Daedalus Publishing Company, the first company dedicated to publishing nonfiction leather/SM/fetish books; prolific writer; former sex advice columnist; former producer and host of the first kink internet talk show Bound To Talk; past Board member of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, Community-Academic Consortium for Research on Alternative Sexualities, NLA International and Avatar Club Los Angeles; co-founder of NLA Los Angeles; and member of Chicago Hellfire Club, The 15 Association, and Society of Janus. Race is currently on the Board of the Leather Hall of Fame. Recently Race was inducted into the Society of Janus Hall of Fame. He is featured in the documentaries Vice and Consent, Out of the Darkness: The Reality of S&M and Folsom Forever, was a BDSM consultant for the movie Exit to Eden, and is currently an Executive Producer for Divine Deviance, an upcoming documentary about the global kink/BDSM/fetish scene. Race is also a popular speaker who has delivered the keynote address for a number of events. He has been awarded the 2006 National Leather Association International's Lifetime Achievement Award, 2010 Mister Marcus Hernandez Lifetime Achievement Award (Man) Pantheon of Leather Community Service Award, the 2011 Philip M. Turner Lifetime Achievement Award, the 2013 National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Creating Change Leather Leadership Award, 2014 San Francisco Bay Area Leather Alliance Co-Man of the Year (tie), and the 2016 NorCal/Northwest Regional Pantheon of Leather Award.

He\u2019s a frequent contributor, writing custom songs for the award-winning, San Francisco based, Bawdy Storytelling. As a solo acoustic act, Bergey's sound is akin to folky musical theater in a coffee shop...if the coffee shop also sold sex toys and sativa gummy bears. His polite vulgarity may not be for the very young and impressionable or the very old and conservative but he won\u2019t tell you how to raise your kids or upset your grandparents.\n\nHe can be seen and heckled every Monday night at his Risqu\u00e9 residency at Scopo Divino in San Francisco. For well over two years straight, he\u2019s put on a unique and interactive show where he plays original music and cover songs suggested by those in attendance who haven\u2019t already left in disgust.\n\nBergey's music can be heard on the RISK! and Bawdy Storytelling podcasts. He has performed at The Independent, Sweetwater, Great American Music Hall, Jewish Community Center in SF, John Steinbeck Association, Special Olympics in Long Beach, Punchline SF, and SF Sketchfest.\n\nHis newest EP titled \u2018Always Up (To Go Down)\u2019 was originally written for Bawdy Storytelling and is flanked by a few of his \u2018inter-lewds\u2019, now fleshed out with piano, bass, and pedal steel.

Then the guitar comes out and kicks the show into an even higher gear with songs about the bright future (and dark past) of babies and what he would do if he woke up one morning as an actual woman.\n\nOn stage, Phil\u2019s playful humor and likeable, endearing manner allow him to shake things up without antagonizing the audience.

Mixing Rumba Flamenca with Reggae and Cumbia with Ska through contagious rhythms and multiple languages, their music takes you on a ride through a day in the emerging globalized experience where the movement of people and ideas are in constant flux. Reflecting lead vocalist Kata\u2019s own experience of growing up Spanish American in Spain, Italy, and the U.S., LoCura\u2019s music rides the borders of identity and migration piecing together a mosaic of our myriad cultures and experiences. In Spain the expression \"Ida y Vuelta\" is used to describe certain styles within Flamenco that made a \"round-trip\" from Spain to Latin America, mixing with music from the African and Indigenous populations. With this idea of music traveling and music as creative resistance, LoCura takes the trip back again mixing it up with their own Califas Flamenkito, Reggae, and Cuban Son styles. Moved by the music that crosses borders and takes root in different lands, LoCura draws from this creative 'rebelde' spirit to cultivate the cures passed on from our ancestors.\n\n***ESPA\u00d1OL: Siguiendo la corriente de la 'Ida y Vuelta' que define tanto el movimiento en el Flamenco como en la musica Latina, LoCura combina la Rumba Flamenca con el Mestizaje Musical de la Bahia de San Francisco pa' dar vida a su propio \"Califas Flamenkito\"- un Son-Rumba-Reggae que baila Cumbia entre el Hip-Hop expresando un Folklor Global Callejera.

It\u2019s a friendship and partnership that\u2019s proved pivotal to both of them both personally and professionally. As a duo, their respective skill sets were perfectly matched: Simon was the one with the more traditional musical background while Ben had a penchant for sound engineering. Both loved DJ culture though and both spun. United by a love of underground club nights like Stealth and Detonate in Nottingham, their passion for music from drum \u2018n\u2019 bass to house was honed after many a night and early morning dancing \u2018til dawn. Needless to say, after they graduated, Messrs James and Hall made their way to London. Wasting no time with their electronic ambitions, both acquired computer software. Says Si over coffee in Kings Cross: \u201cBecause we both had the same interests in music, we thought we\u2019d align our knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe dance-floor-fuelled d \u2018n\u2019 b tear-up \u2018Abort\u2019 was their debut release on Viper, which made so much noise that the duo duly signed to Andy C\u2019s Ram Recordings. Quickly establishing themselves as a force to be reckoned with, \u2018Space Time\u2019/Take The Stairs\u2019 solidified their place as low-end bass innovators. But as you\u2019ll soon hear, this is one duo who don\u2019t ever want to be put in a box. Or stand still for too long either. This isn\u2019t an act dwelling on the past, which is why we\u2019re now going to fast-forward to the present day. With a super-successful debut album for Ram Records/BMG (the chart-chomping \u2018Paradise Lost\u2019) [Debuting in both the US and UK iTunes Electronic charts in the top #10 and shifting over 250k+ copies worldwide across streaming and physical product] and Winners of Best Producers as the 2016 DNB Awards, the Delta future is all about music and touring. But beyond \u2013 and also before - that, what they\u2019re really looking for is their own lane.\n\n\u201cWhen we started coming through via Ram, the genre barriers had dropped around bass music a lot and we were keen to bridge those gaps and work across different genres: we said to Ram at the very beginning that we didn\u2019t want to just make pure drum \u2018n\u2019 bass music, we wanted to do something different. Some people aren\u2019t happy when you do a lot of different stuff so finding a way that incorporates different genres that feels like us took some time. When we made our album, we found that comfortable space.\u201d says Simon.\n\nThe American-sounding stuff that we do bridges that Transatlantic divide.\u201d In the end, it\u2019s about balance. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d nods Ben. \u201cWe grew up going to dirty little raves! Because we play so many territories, in some places they like it more underground and others more mainstream. Varying what you play to suit your audience is important. A short high-powered festival set can be great but we also love Fabric. I live in the US now and we have been doing some big shows in America and Australia, but this Friday I headline Fabric \u2013 so I will get to play some old classics that wouldn\u2019t necessarily fit in at a US festival.\u201d So Fabric still means a lot? \u201cI have been going since I was 16! So yes, it\u2019s still a huge deal for us. It also inspires us to go away and write more music, whether that\u2019s a club banger or a track with real depth.\u201d Both Simon and Ben are wary of DJs who \u201cplay the same set for 18 months. The idea of that numbs my mind! I will spend half of Friday preparing songs for Fabric\u2026 it\u2019s not a chore.\u201d\n\nThat same dedication goes into their new radio show, which airs Friday nights on Evolution/iHeartRadio. \u201cAgain, we just wanted to be in our own lane,\u201d says Ben, \u201cand to enhance that was all about playing music we\u2019re into in an outlet or space where we can play whatever we want to play. I wanted to showcase some UK d \u2018n\u2019 b which they might not be hearing elsewhere. We are trying to show everyone tuning in who\u2019ve heard of us, all the different aspects of what we\u2019re into at the moment. DNB from the UK; dubstep from America, trap stuff from Australia and also some bassier, noisier sounds of course! Hopefully what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t replicated by another show. There\u2019s so much good music being made by so many talented people around the planet, and if we can hear a sonic footprint whatever BPM it\u2019s at, our aim is to tie it all together for a cohesive hour.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Delta Heavy have several key releases in the bag, including a collaboration with Dirty Audio which is being released on both Ram and Monstercat from North America.\n\nAre there grand plans? We\u2019ll let Ben have the final word. \u201cWhen we write these tunes, you never know when things are going to pop up! Are there grand plans? Just to keep writing music! So for now, \u2026 the live show, that's the main focus,\u201d smiles Ben.", "otherInfo": "Vital Events & Olympus Events Present\nSequence 03.19 ft.

Met with immense success, LIL TEXAS\u2019 singles have been supported by Virtual Self, Kill The Noise, Pendulum, and many more.

He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns.

Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone.

I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

He originally set out as a drummer, playing for local cover bands which frequently gigged local bars and college parties in the tri-state area. While attending college, Tim began to experiment with guitar. He became especially fascinated with song-writing and recording. He began co-writing and recording and producing with the New Jersey based band Dog Show Blues. During this time he also worked on what would later become his debut album. Attributing much of his inspiration to his three older brothers, he named the solo project The Fourth Son. His debut album The Fourth Son EP was released in 2014. In the winter of 2015, The Fourth Son relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, and began developing a live presence. He played at open-mic nights throughout the Bay Area, while teaching elementary physical education by day. He released his second album titled Lavenia in 2016. With an increasing number of tour dates the project has developed a unique and powerful live sound. The one-man band switches between acoustic and electric guitar, backed by a kick drum and foot-tambourine.

After their formation in 1979 and release of the \"I Hate Tourists\" Ep in 1980 they recorded the famous song \"This Is Boston, Not LA\" which became the title of the now infamous comp Lp. Although thought of as a Boston band they were actually from the Cape Cod area orignally. After forming while still in high school, the band went thru many shifting line-ups all revolving around singer/lyricist Clif Hanger and for most of the bands existence, guitarist and co-writer Bill Close. In 1983 they released the classic hardcore Lp \"Land Of The Lost\" and then were more or less successful at producing a new Lp every couple years or so up thru the \"personal troubles\" period of the \"Misery Loves Company\" record and ending with their last full-length in 1999, \"One False Move\" on Dr.Strange records. The Freeze music is driving hardcore at it's roots but always has a solid melodic ring thanks to the more-than-competent musical ability of guitarist Bill Close. Clif's lyrics are dark, twisted, unstable, paranoid and at their best are fantasy stories from the scary corners of his mind.\n\n2) The Freeze is also a punk band formed in 1976. The Freeze formed in 1976 and initially consisted of Gordon Sharp (vocals), David Clancy (guitar), Keith Grant (bass), and Graeme Radin (drums). (Later line-ups would see the addition of a guitarist/saxophonist/clarinetist Tony Wallis, alternate drummer/keyboardist Neil Braidwood and alternate bassist Mike Moran.) The band was active from 1976 to 1982, gigging continuously throughout their homeland of Scotland, and supporting a wide range of acts, from the likes of Sham 69 to Echo & The Bunnymen. On stage they were quite the lively bunch - with an unusually diverse spectrum of sound, glam-punk gender-bending theatrics, and a knack for random song improvisation - it was a package that often left onlookers enthusiastically scratching their heads in astonishment.\n\nThe group had two official releases \u2013 1979\u2019s debut 7-inch EP In Colour, and 1980\u2019s 7-inch single Celebration, both of which were self-financed on their own A1 label. And although The Freeze would prove that they undoubtedly had both the musical talent and vision needed to propel their name into the greater new wave market, it was their eclectic and unpredictable nature that ultimately barred them from capturing proper label interest. Not to say their wasn't any interested\u2026 John Peel noticed the band and in late 1980 invited them to do their first BBC radio session, followed by another session in 1981, both of which have yet to see any official release. By 1982 Gordon had become increasingly dissatisfied with the confines of the band\u2019s musical format, wishing to instead give focus to more experimental song structures, a desire which eventually lead him to forge a new union with fellow core-member David Clancy, move to London and change the band\u2019s name to Cindytalk.\n\n(text taken from http://lifeonthedot.blogspot.com/2007/08/freeze-in-colour-ep-1979.html)", "otherInfo": "MORTIFIED \u25cf Mortified is a comic excavation of adolescent writing, art & media.

After\nthe Gay Gay\u2019s went on hiatus, Freeman moved forward with forming a band that could be as\ngood as AC/DC.\n\nFreeman began by recruiting lightning-speed guitarist, Steve McKnight after meeting him online\nand sharing similar musical tastes.

At the end of the 20th Century, two of those albums, \u201cEagles: Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975)\u201d and \u201cHotel California,\u201d ranked among the ten best-selling albums ever, according to the certifications of the Record Industry Association of America.\nThough most of its members came from outside of California, the group was closely identified with a country- and folk \u2013tinged sound that initially found favor in and around Los Angeles in the late 60\u2019s, as played by bands such as, \u2018The Flying Burito Brothers\u2019 and \u2018Poco\u2019, which both contributed members to \u2018The Eagles.\u2019 The band also drew upon traditional rock n\u2019 roll styles and in their later work helped defined the broadly popular rock sound, eventually referred to as Classic Rock. This helped The Eagles to achieve a perennial appeal among the generations of music fans who continued to buy their records many years after they had split up, which inspired the reunion they mounted in the mid-90\u2019s. The Eagles were inducted into the Hall of Fame in January 1983.\nThe Eagles released their first album in 28 years in October 2007 and the new touring schedule to promote this album is guaranteed to spark a resurgence in The Eagles music.\nSit Back, close your eyes and feel the years drop away as you experience a musical journey that will transport you to the very best of times!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1807 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Third Eye Blind", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8009171.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative Rock, Alternative, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Fox Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Third Eye Blind is a post-grunge, alternative rock band formed in the mid 1990s in San Francisco, California. The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "MH The Verb", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8037746.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Michael Bennett Erie Reader, A Whole New Movement of Hip Hop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sofar Sounds", "moreBioInfo": "I am a whiskey drinking, boat shoe wearing, MC/DJ/Producer who currently resides on a Megabus between a pair of imitation BeatsbyDre Headphones.

After losing total vision by age 11 and a decade of classical violin and piano, he switched to jazz piano in high school at the Governor's School for Performing Arts studying with Liz Barnes and Old Dominion University's John Toomey. He attended the Vail Jazz Workshop, Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead Residency, and received top honors in jazz festivals across the U.S. He began performing jazz professionally at age 15, most notably with the Jae Sinnett Trio.\n\nIn 2004, Justin attended William Paterson University in New Jersey where he was taken under the wings of legendary trumpeter, Clark Terry and became a member of the Clark Terry Ensemble. He also studied with his hero, the late Mulgrew Miller as well as Harold Mabern. He graduated summa cum laude, moved to NYC, and at age 23 produced, led, composed and performed on his debut CD, Introducing Justin Kauflin.\n\nIn 2012, he was the House Pianist at Havana Nights Jazz Club in Virginia Beach where his trio headlined regularly. He won the VSA International Young Soloist Award, was voted VEER's \"Jazz Artist of the Year\" and was selected as semifinalist in the prestigious Thelonious Monk Int'l Jazz Piano Competition.\n\nDuring this time, Justin's relationship with mentor Clark Terry was being chronicled by friend and fellow musician, Al Hicks. Five years in the making, the resultant documentary, Keep On Keepin' On, won numerous awards and made the Oscar's Short List. Justin composed the film score and was subsequently signed for management by legendary producer and music icon, Quincy Jones.\n\nHicks continued on to produce a second documentary, \"Quincy.\" And, Justin went on to record on 10 albums, 3 of which he produced as leader, and brought the film, workshops & performances around the world.\n\nQuincy oversaw Justin's second and fourth full-length albums, Dedication (2015) and Coming Home (2018).

After\nthe Gay Gay\u2019s went on hiatus, Freeman moved forward with forming a band that could be as\ngood as AC/DC.\n\nFreeman began by recruiting lightning-speed guitarist, Steve McKnight after meeting him online\nand sharing similar musical tastes. McKnight has been a part of the LA music scene since the\nlate \u201880s in Cry Wolf, a melodic hard rock band that made their mark on the Sunset Strip and\nbeyond with several major albums under their belt.\n\nAlso recruited was Karl Rumpf on rhythm guitar, who Freeman had met while on tour with\nPansy Division and later worked with in a band/project called Dart. Rumpf was also in the last\nincarnation of the Gay Gay\u2019s, along with drummer Brian Welch who Freeman had also met\nwhile on tour. Welch had spent years touring with Extreme as their drum tech, so he was a\nnatural fit.\n\nThis four-piece spent months looking for a gay vocalist to no avail. Finally, Freeman asked the\nothers if HE could audition. Nervously, he did, the band agreed, and they were off\u2014but now\nthey needed a bassist, so Freeman recruited bass player extraordinaire, Glen Pavan, once again\nsomeone Freeman had met while on tour. Pavan had previously been keeping the low end down\nfor LA queer punk rockers Best Revenge (who got their name from a Pansy Division song).\n\nNow in their second year as a band, the word of mouth has been intense, even scoring a \u201cpick of\nthe week\u201d in LA Weekly for a recent LA gig.\n\nThe band remains true to the music (working diligently to replicate the actual sound of AC/DC),\nwhile playing around with the lyrics and changing pronouns to suit the gay angle. Hence, TNT\nbecomes PNP (a song about the \u201cparty-n-play\u201d status some gay men post in their online sex ads),\nBad Boy Boogie becomes Gay Boy Boogie (do you really need to ask?), and Big Balls needed\n\u2026 no changing at all!\n\nTo say the band is off-the-hook live is an understatement.

It is a dark, pressing and lively album that reflects on a sense of loss, of time slipping away through your fingers. MTT mixes up influences from Kate Bush, Michael Jackson, The Knife and Portishead and draws inspiration from horror movies, ghost stories blending the otherworldly with universal feelings of anxiety, melancholy and hope. [DUTCH] Na een veelgeprezen debuut komt MTT (voorheen Minus The Tiger) in het voorjaar van 2014 met de opvolger, Years From Now. Het sfeervolle, persoonlijke album is zowel muzikaal als inhoudelijk een spannende stap vooruit. Een intensieve periode waarin onder meer de geboorte van een dochter voor een nieuw perspectief zorgde, krijgt een introspectieve, bij vlagen melancholische invulling. Vrees niet, het album blijft ver uit de buurt van een muzikale versie van het wanhopigere segment van de ingezonden brievenrubriek van de Ouders van Nu. Sterker, MTT heeft een knap, doorleefd en urgent album gemaakt, speciaal voor iedereen die weet hoe het voelt als de tijd je door de vingers glipt. De gloedvolle en wonderlijk geslaagde poging de jaren tachtig te mixen met een actuele sound, zijn een voorlopige kroon op de samenwerking tussen zangeres Anne Broekman, producer Maarten Besseling en drummer Jos Terlingen. Het resultaat sluit nog nadrukkelijker aan bij de internationale ambities die de band met het debuut over de grenzen al op de kaart zette. Met het secuur afgestelde samenspel tussen diepe bassen en vervreemdende sounds ontpopt MTT zich nog meer als \u00e9\u00e9n van de meest verfrissende Nederlandse acts.

Whether they're preforming on-stage or busking on the street you can be assured of performances that will both lift your soul and be the perfect soundtrack for your next barfight.\n\nThe Gentlemen Soldiers are JB Duff, Emily Froberg, Marcos Garcia and Tony Gibson. These four grew up playing in separate punk, metal and rock bands throughout the North Bay. From these early days, they have brought their ethos and their musical repertoire into the realm of traditional Irish music. The sound they create is one of camaraderie, with songs that both taunt and cheer you in the way that only the Irish can. So whether you stay for a pint or stay for ten, raise your glass with a \"Sl\u00e1inte\" and a KMRIA with The Gentlemen Soldiers!", "otherInfo": "It\u2019s the weekend before St. Paddy\u2019s Day and Gentlemen Soldiers are starting early in their hometown!

The band has featured many guests and shared the stage with Melvin Seals several times since 2014. Lead guitarist Matt Hartle brings experience from collaborations with Dead-family musicians, has an acclaimed body of original material, and is a founding member of Santa Cruz-based Shady Groove. Matt has shared the stage with guitarists including Henry Kaiser and Stu Allen, and is a current member of Painted Mandolin with Joe Craven. Scott has several solo albums to his credit with his band, Scott Cooper & the Barrelmakers. Keyboardist Steve Sofranko is a regular in Stu Allen & Mars Hotel. Roger formerly played bass in David Gans & the Sycamore Slough String Band and has performed with artists such as Michael Kang, David Nelson, Henry Kaiser and Frank Wakefield. Drummer Michael Owens is an in-demand player who is versed in New Orleans, jazz, reggae and African drumming. Members of the band have also performed or recorded with Stu Allen (JGB), Melvin Seals (JGB), David Nelson (NRPS), Bill Payne (Little Feat), Barry Sless (Phil & Friends, David Nelson), Ben Ellman (Galactic), Howard Wales (Jerry Garcia), Bill Laymon (New Riders), Keith Graves (Jefferson Starship, Quicksilver), George Marsh (David Grisman Quintet), Bobby Black (Hank Williams, Bob Dylan), Luka Frederickson (Wolfman Washington), Mike Schermer (Elvin Bishop, Maria Muldaur), Marc Carino (Fabulous Thunderbirds), James \"Fingers\" Shupe (Dan Hicks), (Charlie Musselwhite Band), Frank Wakefield, and many others. Armed with a large repertoire of tunes from the Dead's 150-song repertoire, the China Cats, like the Dead, do not repeat songs from one night to the next. Their repertoire spans the Dead's entire career including vintage gems such as \"St. Stephen\"; epic masterpieces like \"Terrapin Station,\" \"Help on the Way -> Slipknot\"; Bob Weir jam numbers like \"Let it Grow\" and \"Feel Like a Stranger\"; obscurities like \"Mission in the Rain\" and \"Brother Esau\", and latter-day nuggets such as \"Lazy River Road,\" \"Liberty\" and \"So Many Roads.\" Despite their various allegiances, China Cats is a full-fledged band, listening closely to one another as they share the happy tangle that defines Dead-style jams. They relish the use of familiar Dead motifs: bluegrassy phrasing on lines far outside the bluegrass idiom, group pauses with glimmering sustained notes, and overlapping scales that unfurled like maypole ribbons. ================================================== \"The China Cats are widely recognized as the top Dead tribute band in the state and for good reason.

Drawing inspiration from an eclectic mix of musical styles, Jah Sun aspires to awaken in his audience the desire to meet the challenges of life and to live to their ultimate potential. Jah Sun\u2019s upbeat and hopeful view of life first emerged during his childhood. Growing up in a bicultural family gave him a unique perspective not only on life but also on music. At an early age Jah Sun\u2019s musical talent began to emerge. By age 12, he was a featured hip-hop artist on a local radio station. At this time in his life, Jah Sun says \u201cmusic was a salvation.\u201d As he grew a little older, he was the opening act for numerous national touring hip hop artists, including Black Moon, Masta Ace, Smiff n Wesson and The Getto Boys among many others. His talent as a hip-hop artist, was no longer a secret. When he turned 20 years old, Jah Sun discovered a musical genius who would forever change his world. That genius was Bob Marley. Jah Sun felt an automatic affinity to Marley\u2019s spiritual, mature and worldly music. The imprint Marley left on Jah Sun inspired him to expand his musical horizons and to embrace the message and movement of reggae music. Not soon after, Jah Sun decided to throw his whole being into his music. He moved to Los Angeles and made a total commitment to finding success in the music industry. His commitment, perseverance and unwavering hope soon paid-off. In 2006, Jah Sun\u2019s debut album, \u201cHeight of Light\u201d, was released. It featured many of reggae\u2019s top recording artists, such as Luciano, Junior Reid, Lutan Fyah and Grammy Award winner, Yami Bolo. Of the album, The Beat Magazine\u2019s Chuck Foster says, \u201cJah Sun shines brightly on the \u201cHeight of Light\u201d\u2026the message remains positive and focused throughout\u2026and offers some solution to the social problems addressed.\u201d The album featured a variety of musical styles that ranged from fierce hip-hop explosions, to melodic ballads, to rootsy anthems. In short, \u201cHeight of Light\u201d has something to offer to everyone. The importance of the album to the reggae industry as well as to mainstream markets was soon apparent. After its release, Jah Sun was the recipient of many accolades. The song \u201cFyah Dance\u201d was nominated for the LA Music Awards\u2019 Hip-Hop Single of the Year for 2006 and the same song was featured on the 2006 season premiere of MTVs hit show, \u201cLaguna Beach\u201d. A second song, \u201cNuff a Dem\u201d was included in FUEL TV\u2019s 2007 Vans Downtown Showdown. In early 2012, Jah Sun released his breakout album \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d. The album features a host of reggae superstars, including Peetah Morgan, Alborosie, Stevie Culture, Perfect, J-Boog and Gentlemen. According to Reggaeville\u2019s Justine Amadori Ketola, the songs on \u201cBattle of the Dragon\u201d come from \u201ca wellspring of knowledge that Jah Sun possess in the teaching of Rastafari but also has the positive vibration of all spiritual practices, a sense of oneness and positivity that keeps the vibes high.\u201d Following the release of this album Jah Sun toured not only the US but also Europe, including Sweden, Spain, and Italy. The impact that \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d has had on his ever-growing fan base is phenomenal. Two of the songs from \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d were picked up by the distributors Extreme Music and SuperPop which specialize in TV and film placement. One song from the album \u201cWhere is your Love\u201d was featured on one episode of the highly successful TV program \u201cGlee\u201d. Even though it\u2019s been over a year since its release, songs from \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d as well as songs from his previously released albums continue to chart on radio stations nationwide. As his music grows in popularity, so too do his awards and award nominations. Perhaps the most notable award he has received for \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d was at the Positive Vibrations Reggae Awards 2012 for International Album of the Year. Winning this award is a testimony to Jah Sun\u2019s ever-growing popularity not only in America but the world over. Currently, Jah Sun is working on a new album which will feature industry veterans as well as rising stars. The album will certainly build upon the positive vibes and the message of hope that have become Jah Sun\u2019s trademark. Audiences can also be assured, as Bob Doran of the North Coast Journal has said \u201c\u2026an irie time is guaranteed for all\u201d.

While Desert Hearts catapults successfully into the scene as a major player through their twice yearly festival, touring internationally throwing parties under the moniker City Hearts, and launching a (free!) record label, Marbs continues to hone his production skills and also blows the art game out of the water, hand drawing all of the label\u2019s artwork and inspiring tattoo artists everywhere. Marbs\u2019 musical talents and humble dj presence commands any dance floor with his sounds of mystical darkness and whimsical tribal rhythms; the night sky is the limit for this King of Darkness. With a sound like no other, a heart of gold, and a determination matched by few, Marbs is sure to lead this movement of love until the very happy end.", "otherInfo": "Inquiry Collective & Public Works Present: Desert Hearts Black: Marbs, Evan Casey & Rinzen"}, {"Address": "1600 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Fake Fruit", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.399885, 37.765168], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Thee Parkside", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "853 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Dona Francisca", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.421068, 37.759319], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Amnesia", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Forro music by Dona Francisca Every 2nd Friday, come dance Forro, an infectious Brazilian folksy partner swing dance that is easy to learn, a little sexy, and straight up fun."}, {"Address": "2369 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "ICandy", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.434352, 37.762839], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "I Candy at The Cafe: This long-running gay dance hotspot recently reopened after major renovations.

It's like 1978 all over again, when U2 first stormed the pubs of Dublin, Ireland.\n\nBut this is the 21st Century in San Francisco, and the band is Zoo Station, a quartet that bills itself \"The Complete U2 Experience.\" Since 2002, this talented force has delivered the visual, musical and spiritual thrill of a U2 concert to bars, clubs, outdoor festivals, private parties and corporate events along the West Coast of North America. Singer Bonalmost leads the show, flying high with the vocal strength and confidence of Bono's The Joshua Tree days. The Sledge showers thick layers of effectual guitar work over crowd as Adamesque on bass and Barely Larry on the drums deliver the pounding heartbeat of some of modern rock's most memorable songs.\n\nThe band's primary job is replication, but periodically Zoo Station innovates as much as it imitates. During their trademark full-album spotlight sets in which the band plays an entire U2 album from start to finish Zoo Station encounters such obscurities as \"Elvis Presley and America,\" \"Promenade,\" \"Red Hill Mining Town\" and \"Acrobat,\" songs rarely or never performed live by U2.\n\n\"Songs like these are exciting,\" says Bonalmost. \"All we can really do is ask ourselves, 'What would U2 have done onstage?'\"\n\nMore familiar are melodies like \"Pride (In The Name of Love),\" \"With or Without You,\" \"Beautiful Day,\" and \"Vertigo.\" Behind the band, a multi-media visual projection system elevates Zoo Station's performances to the highest level of virtual authenticity. Swirling abstract imagery appears behind the stage, interspersed with rapid-fire \"U2-phemisms\" and in-synch flashing light choreography. All are recognizable from U2 shows, and these visual effects, centerpieced by Bonalmost's lively theatrics, reflect Zoo Station's deep-set love of U2's music and their commitment to fully recreating the dense emotional impact of a U2 concert.\n\nSince day-one, when an earnest Craigslist posting sparked the band, Zoo Station has played nearly 600 shows and now flourishes a repertoire of nearly 160 U2 songs. The sing-along radio hits appease casual listeners, while the most loyal U2 fans are wowed by the surprising depth and variety of the set list. Such thrilling rock and roll was made for vast arenas, one-acre stages and sky-high screens, and though U2 quit the bar scene in 1980, Zoo Station thrives there, doing what U2 no longer can: setting the smallest neighborhood pubs burning to life with a sound that has drowned out the world.", "otherInfo": "Zoo Station - The Complete U2 Experience at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Metalachi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6995584.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Metalachi", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "Be sure to follow the entire band on their personal facebook profiles..

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1410 Old County Rd, Belmont, CA 94002", "Artist": "Neon Velvet", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6128653.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.270236, 37.516673], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Your Red Carpet Dance Party", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "St. James Gate Bar and Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "Smoochy The very best new and classic dance hits.

Shifting from University student to student of house/techno, Tolfrey quickly picked up the skills that mark out a true DJ: varied selection, an open mind, and the ability to read as well as lead a crowd. This passion for unearthing quality, moving with the times, and creating his own vision of where electronic music is heading has extended to his Leftroom imprint; now running for over 12 years and celebrating 70+ releases from artists as varied as Maceo Plex and Laura Jones to Jay Haze and DJ Bone, picking up equally varied love and support along the way. As with most DJs of his generation, the studio has also been a place for Tolfrey to experiment. Walking the walk as well as talking the talk, most of Tolfrey\u2019s output (including his well received \u2018Word of Mouth\u2019 LP) has cropped up on Leftroom, but when venturing out to other labels, there\u2019s always a link in terms of friendships and like-minded attitudes. This unshakeable focus on genuine relationships bleeds through to Tolfrey\u2019s Don\u2019t Be Leftout parties and compilations. Upon first meeting Tolfrey the words that will likely come to mind are: energetic, infectious, and the life of the party.

Chicago\u2019s Alinka is one of them.\u2019 \u2014Terry Matthew, 5Magazine A self-described citizen of the world, Alinka spent her early life in Kiev, Ukraine before departing for Vienna in 1988, eventually landing her in her permanent home of Chicago\u2014a move that would unknowingly shape her future and solidify her fate and connection to music. Hailing from a musical family, Alinka was brought up playing the piano and was kindly placed in her room to practice from the time she could sit up on a bench. Her musical obsession grew exponentially upon landing in the US and discovering pop music like Michael Jackson and Madonna for the first time, leading her to constantly memorizing titles and making mix tapes for friends. Alinka was first exposed to dance music through the radio during the 90s, but it wasn\u2019t until she left for University that she really discovered House Music and became immersed in rave and club culture. After a year of traveling to parties, working for promoters, collecting records and continuously searching for new music, she decided to dedicate herself to learning the craft of DJing, bought a pair of Technics and set off on her mission. Less than two years later, in 2001, Alinka landed her first residency, serving as Justin Long\u2019s opener at the infamous Smart Bar Chicago for his monthly party .Dotbleep. She stayed there, honing her skills until 2008 and hasn\u2019t looked back since. In 2012, an impromptu meeting with former Hercules and Love Affair vocalist, Shaun J. Wright, changed her life forever. The pair instantly bonded over their shared love for Chicago House Music and Cajual Records, and it wasn\u2019t long before their evolving friendship resulted in what would be the first of many musical collaborations. Their debut EP, Twirl Vol.1, was promptly signed to Derrick Carter and Luke Solomon\u2019s esteemed label, Classic Music Company. The release was followed by a 12\" remix compilation with mixes from Derrick Carter, Neville Watson and Chrissy, which received worldwide acclaim and support from famed artists and publications, launching the pair into global success. In 2014, Wright and Alinka launched their own imprint, Twirl Recordings, as a follow-up to their monthly party Twirl in Chicago\u2014an event that, featuring guests like Derrick Carter, The Black Madonna, and Eli Escobar was essential in setting the tone for their own label. Their debut release, Journey Into The Deep, with remixes from renowned artists Kim Ann Foxman and Stereogamous, propelled Twirl into the spotlight, winning support from prominent artists like Heidi, Robert Owens, Annie Mac, Groove Armada, and Art Department\u2019s Kenny Glasgow. The EP also got DJ Mag's approval with a 9.0 rating, and made multiple appearances on BBC Radio 1 Dance Radio. Since its beginning, Twirl releases have been featured in Mixmag, DJ Mag, XLR8TR, BBC Radio 1, Kiss FM UK, and countless other radio shows and publications. Now on their 12th release, the label has gone on to feature a diverse range of artists including Luke Solmon, Eli Escobar, Snuff Crew, Lil\u2019 Mark, A\u00e9rea Negrot, Mijo & Macaulay, Photonz & Violet, Spatial Awareness, and many more. After a series of successful releases on Twirl, the pair continued pushing forward. 2015 saw the launch of 3 tracks as a follow-up to Twirl Vol. 1 through Classic Music Company with the track Matters Of The Heart getting a special remix treatment from The Black Madonna. The following year would bring several high-profile releases including the 3 track EP Face The Truth for Damian Lazarus\u2019 legendary Crosstown Rebels with a remix by Audiojack, followed by the EP Greed for Waifs & Strays imprint Lovecrimes with remixes by Jozif and Waifs & Strays. Between putting out original material, Wright and Alinka have been busy composing remixes for a wide range of labels and artists, most recently including Boy George for Fetch Records and Matt Tolfrey and Jozif\u2019s project Kerb Staller for Leftroom. To date, the two have had their work featured on labels like Defected, Batty Bass, Classic Music Company, Crosstown Rebels, Leftroom, Tribal America, Midnight Riot, Bargrooves , Forevergreen Ltd., and Modern Revival. 2017 brings perhaps their most exciting releases to date, an upcoming 8 track EP for Heidi\u2019s Jackathon imprint, as well as a remix for Chrissy and Mister Saturday Night\u2019s label The Night Owl Diner. In addition to her collaborations with Wright, Alinka has produced a multitude of releases and remixes for labels like Nein Records, Get Up Recordings, Audiophile Deep, Apollo Music, and Vizual. Her remix of Eli Escobar\u2019s Anotha Love was featured in Beatport\u2019s Decade In House feature, and was chosen by them as one of the top House tracks of 2014. 2016 marked a pivotal point for Alinka when she relocated to Berlin and kicked off the year with her debut appearance at the world renowned Berghain/Panorama Bar, followed by an impressive slew of gigs including Crosstown Rebels Get Lost Miami, Maya Jane Coles & Friends at Printworks London, and Ellen Allien\u2019s BPitch Boogy at Ipse Berlin. In an age of homogenized dance culture, you can trust yourself to find a unique soul committed to \u2018keeping things weird\u2019 in Alinka. Her desire to push boundaries, combined with her dedication to underground dance music, continues to move her forward and making her mark. DJ and House Music Producer from Chicago.

Born in Quebec City, Quebec, MacDonald started out performing in comedy clubs across Canada before he decided to pack his bags and move to Los Angeles. His wry style landed him gigs writing for the popular sitcom Roseanne along with The Dennis Miller Show, but a 1993 offer to write for SNL had him switching coasts and moving to New York City. A year later he was hosting the show's Weekend Update segment, delivering deadpan jokes about prison rape and crack whores that sometime received more gasps than laughs. Original Weekend Update host Chevy Chase declared him the best \"fake anchor\" he had ever seen, and while a cult of MacDonald fans was growing, the West Coast president of NBC, Don Ohlmeyer, was certainly not one of them. Ohlmeyer pressured Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels to fire MacDonald on the grounds he was \"not funny.\" MacDonald was off Weekend Update in 1997 and completely off the show in 1998, the same year he made his feature film debut with the genuine bomb Dirty Work.\n\nIn 1999 he landed a sitcom on ABC titled simply Norm. The show -- which featured his good friend and future Howard Stern sidekick Artie Lange -- struggled for three years to find an audience before it was canceled. During this time he starred in another silver screen bomb, Screwed, which was released in 2000. In 2003 he was given another chance at sitcoms with the Fox project A Minute with Stan Hooper, which only lasted six episodes despite critics' praise. He kept a low profile for the next couple years with a few talk show appearances here and there, most of them on Stern's show, where MacDonald would discuss his beloved gambling. Standup appearances around the U.S. also kept him busy until 2006, when he finished his first album. Nine years in the making, Ridiculous bucked the unambitious trend most comedy albums were following -- being nothing more than the audio companions to live performance DVDs -- and presented 12 sketches with guests like Will Ferrell, Artie Lange, Tim Meadows, and Molly Shannon. The album was released by the Comedy Central label and produced by Brooks Arthur, the man behind Adam Sandler's successful series of sketch comedy albums.", "otherInfo": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL Two item minimum purchase required.

One of the shows produced at the CBC was Pick The Stars, a local talent show. He noticed four gentlemen practicing in the hallway for that show, and stopped to listen. After exchanging niceties, Somerville offered to be their manager. This group was composed of Stan Fisher, Ted Kowalski, Phil Levitt, and Bill Reed. They agreed and for the next several months, Somerville provided tutoring, and got practice time in un-occupied studios at the CBC.\nThat Christmas, the group was to sing for a Christmas party at a local church. That date conflicted with lead singer Stan Fisher's studies for a law exam; Fisher decided he needed the study time. Since Somerville knew all the songs, he took Fisher\u2019s place. The audience reaction to the Somerville-led group was so tremendous that the group that night decided to turn professional. In one fateful decision Fisher decided to stay in law school and not continue with the group. Somerville became the permanent lead, and that was the night The Diamonds were born.\nBy 1955, all members of the group had left college, and/or jobs to sing full time. Professional musician Nat Goodman became their manager and got The Diamonds onto Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on American television. The result of the contest was a stalemate between The Diamonds and another contestant. The prize of being guest artist for a week on Godfrey\u2019s show led to a recording contract with Coral Records. Coral released four songs, the most notable being \"Black Denim Trousers & Motorcycle Boots\", a cover of a recording originally by The Cheers. The Diamonds' version sold a few thousand copies, which was only enough to get them a little local recognition.\nThe next big step was an audition with Cleveland, Ohio, radio disc jockey Bill Randle, who had aided in the success of some popular groups, such as The Crew Cuts. Randle was impressed with The Diamonds and introduced them to Mercury Records, who signed the group to a recording contract. At this time, black artists were not played on white radio stations. Mercury Records, as well as other major record companies, were designating white artists to cover the recordings of black artists for the purpose of expanding their listening audience.\nThe Diamonds\u2019 first recording for Mercury was \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" a cover of Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers\u2019s version, which reached #12 in the U.S. as their first hit. They had a hit follow-up single, \"The Church Bells May Ring\" (originally by The Willows), which reached #14 in the U.S. They also covered songs by such black groups as The Clovers and The Heartbeats.\nThe Diamonds biggest hits were 1957's \"Little Darlin'\" (originally recorded by The Gladiolas) and 1958's \"The Stroll\", which was not a cover, but an original song written for the group by Brook Benton, from an idea by Dick Clark.\nAlthough they were signed to do rock and roll, Mercury also paired them with Pete Rugolo in one of his \"Meet\" series. The album entitled \"The Diamonds Meet Pete Rugolo\" allowed The Diamonds to return to their roots and do some established standards.\nThe group sang \"Little Darlin'\" and \"Where Mary Go\" in the film The Big Beat, and sang the theme song for another film, Kathy-O.\nThey had many television appearances, including the TV shows of Steve Allen, Perry Como, Vic Damone, Tony Bennett, Eddy Arnold and Paul Winchell. They also appeared on American Bandstand.\nBy 1961, all original members had left the group. The members were now Jim Malone (lead vocal), Mike Douglas (baritone), Evan Fisher (tenor, who, contrary to popular belief, was not the brother of original lead Stan Fisher), and John Felton (bass). Despite the ever-changing style of rock & roll and their Mercury contract expiring, The Diamonds continued touring the country. There is a popular belief that The Diamonds disbanded in the early sixties. This is untrue. After their Mercury contract expired, the group recorded a single (\"The Slide/Melody of Love\") and an album for the independent NATHANIAL label. Jimmy Malone and Evan Fisher left the group to perform as a duo in the mid 60s.\nMike Douglas carried the torch throughout the 1960s and 70s, and after his departure, John Felton became the driving force of the Diamonds.\nIn 1975, John Felton hired USC graduate Gary Owens as a bass guitar player. Owens eventually became The Diamonds baritone after the departure of Mike Douglas and continues to guide the group to this day. The lineup of Owens, Michael Lawrence, Adam David Marino and Jeff Dolan is the latest combination and strives to be true to the legendary sound created by Somerville, Levitt, Kowalski and Reed.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1511 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117-2912", "Artist": "Justin Rock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7248992.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.44759, 37.76983], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 PM", "Venue": "Club Deluxe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "jazz"}, {"Address": "2087 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Greg Abate", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10020407.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.268704, 37.871272], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "California Jazz Conservatory", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "138 King St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Bray", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8816241.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.390854, 37.779144], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Pop Rock", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Hotel VIA", "moreBioInfo": "Bray is a San Francisco-based singer songwriter with the fire and strut of the quintessential rock front-man, the moves and voice of the classic soul-man and the quick self-effacing humor of a beloved talk show host.

He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

A punk rock musician, political activist and owner of an influential record label, he is best known for his time as the lead singer and song writer for San Francisco punk band, the Dead Kennedys. After his time with the band concluded, he continued as a musician in numerous collaborations and as a spoken word artist. Through his record label, Alternative Tentacles, he released many of his own recordings. Politically, he is a member of the Green Party and actively supports progressive political causes. He is a self-proclaimed anarchist who advocates civil disobedience and pranksterism in the name of political change. Biafra is known to use absurdist media tactics in the tradition of the Yippies to highlight issues of civil rights, social justice, and anti-corporatism.\n\nHis stage name is a combination of the brand name Jell-O and the name of the short lived country of Biafra which attempted to secede from Nigeria in 1966. After four years of fighting and horrific starvation in Biafra, Nigeria regained control of the nascent Biafran state. Jello Biafra created his name as an ironic combination of a nutritionally poor mass-produced food product and mass starvation. He said he likes how two ideas clash in people's minds.\n\nEric Boucher was born in Boulder, Colorado, USA to Jewish parents Stanley Boucher, a psychiatric social worker and poet, and Virginia Boucher, a librarian. As a child, Boucher developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. He was an avid watcher of news and one of his earliest memories is of the John F. Kennedy assassination.[3] Biafra claims he has been a fan of rock music since first hearing it in 1965, when his parents accidentally tuned in to a rock radio station. During the 1970s, he became involved in activism in reaction to several events of the era including the Vietnam War, the Chicago 7 trial, and the Kent State shootings.\n\nHe began his career in music in January of 1977 as a roadie for the punk rock band The Ravers (who would later change their name to The Nails). In the fall of that year, he began attending the University of California, Santa Cruz. He spent one quarter of the year studying acting and the history of Paraguay before leaving to become involved in San Francisco, California's punk scene. In June of 1978 he responded to an ad put out by guitarist East Bay Ray and together they formed the Dead Kennedys. He began performing with the band under the stage name Occupant, but shortly after began using his current stage name. Biafra wrote the band's lyrics, most of which were political in nature and displayed a sardonic, sometimes absurdist, sense of humor despite their serious subject matter. In June of 1979, Biafra co-founded the record label Alternative Tentacles with which the Dead Kennedys released their first single, \"California \u00dcber Alles\". The label was created to allow the band to release albums without having to deal with pressure from major labels to change their music (although the major labels were not willing to sign the band due to their songs being deemed too controversial). After dealing with Cherry Red in the UK and IRS Records in the US for their first album Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables, the band released all later albums (and later pressings of Fresh Fruit) on Alternative Tentacles (with the exception of live albums released after the band's break-up, which the other band members compiled from recordings in the band partnership's vaults without Biafra's input or endorsement). Biafra has been the owner of the company ever since its founding, though he does not receive a salary for his position (Biafra refers to his position in the company as the \"absentee thoughtlord\").\n\nIn the fall of 1979, Biafra ran for mayor of San Francisco as a prank, using the Jello ad campaign catchphrase, \"There's always room for Jello\", as his campaign slogan. Having entered the race before creating a campaign platform, Biafra later wrote his platform on a napkin while attending a Pere Ubu concert. As he campaigned, Biafra wore campaign t-shirts from his opponent Quentin Kopp's previous campaign and at one point vacuumed leaves off the front lawn of another opponent, current U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, to mock her publicity stunt of sweeping streets in downtown San Francisco for a few hours. Supporters committed equally odd actions; two well known signs held by supporters said \"If he doesn't win I'll kill myself\" and \"What if he does win?\" His platform included unconventional points such as forcing businessmen to wear clown suits within city limits and a citywide ban on cars (although the latter point was not considered abnormal by many voters at the time, as the city was suffering from serious pollution problems). Biafra has expressed irritation that these parts of his platform attained such notoriety, preferring instead to be remembered for serious proposals such as legalizing squatting in vacant, tax-delinquent buildings and requiring police officers to keep their jobs by running for election voted on by the people of the neighborhoods they patrol. During a TV interview (reproduced on The Early Years home video and DVD), he had this to say to those who thought less of him running for mayor: \u201cFor those of them who have seen my candidacy as a publicity stunt or a joke, they should keep in mind that it is no more of a joke, and no less of a joke than anyone else they care to name.\u201d He finished fourth out of a field of ten, receiving 3.5% of the vote (6,591 votes); the election ended in a runoff that did not involve him (Feinstein was declared the winner). In reaction to his campaign (and that of Sister Boom-Boom, a drag queen who also ran for mayor and handily won the third place spot above Biafra), San Francisco passed a resolution stating that no candidate could run under any name other than their given name.\n\nThe Dead Kennedys toured widely during their career, starting in the late 1970s. They began playing mostly at southern Californian clubs (most notably the Whisky a Go Go), but eventually they moved on to major clubs across the country, including the CBGB in New York. Later, they played to larger audiences such as at the 1980 Bay Area Music Awards (where they played the notorious \"Pull My Strings\" for the first and only time), and headlined the 1983 Rock Against Reagan festival.\n\nBiafra married Therese Soder, aka Ninotchka, lead singer of San Francisco-area punk band The Situations on October 31, 1981.Flipper vocalist/bassist Bruce Loose conducted the wedding, having paid to join the Universal Life Church as a minister just to conduct the ceremony, which took place in a graveyard. The wedding reception, which members of Flipper, Black Flag, and D.O.A. attended, was held at director Joe Reis' Target Video studios. The marriage ended in 1986.\n\nBiafra became a spoken word artist in January 1986, starting with a performance at University of California, Los Angeles. In his performance he combined his sense of humor with his political beliefs, much in the same way that he did with the lyrics to his songs. Biafra has held this career since, but did not begin recording spoken word records until after the disbandment of the Dead Kennedys.\n\nIn April of the same year, police officers raided his house in response to complaints by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In June of 1986, then- L.A. deputy city attorney Michael Guarino, working under then-City Attorney James Hahn, brought Biafra to trial in Los Angeles for distributing \"harmful matter\" in the Dead Kennedys album Frankenchrist. In actuality, the dispute was about neither the music nor the lyrics from the album, but rather a print of a poster included with the album, Landscape #XX (also known as Penis Landscape), by Swiss surreal artist H. R. Giger. Biafra believes the trial was politically motivated; it was often reported that the PMRC took Biafra to court as a cost effective way of sending a message out to other musicians who have \"offensive\" content in their music.\n\nMusic author Rebee Garofalo argued that Biafra and Alternative Tentacles may have been targeted because the label was a \"small, self-managed and self-supported company that could ill afford a protracted legal battle.\" Facing the possible sentence of a year in jail and a $2000 fine, Biafra founded the No More Censorship Defense Fund, a benefit made up of several punk rock bands, to help pay for his legal fees, which neither he nor his record label could afford. The jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal, prompting a mistrial; despite a district attorney motion to re-try the case, the judge ordered all charges dropped. The Dead Kennedys disbanded during the trial, in December 1986, due to the mounting legal costs; in the wake of their disbandment, Biafra made a career of his spoken word performances. His early spoken word albums focused heavily on the trial (especially in High Priest of Harmful Matter), which made him renowned for his anti-censorship stance.\n\nIn 1988, Biafra and Alain Jourgensen of the band Ministry formed the band Lard. The band became a side project for the members of Ministry, with Biafra providing vocals and lyrics. While working on the film Terminal City Ricochet in 1989, Biafra did a song for the film's soundtrack with D.O.A. As a result, Biafra worked together with D.O.A. on the album Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors. Biafra also worked with Nomeansno on the soundtrack, which lead to their collaboration on the album The Sky is Falling and I Want My Mommy the following year.\n\nOn May 7 1994 people who believed Biafra was a sell out attacked him at the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. Biafra claims that he was attacked by a man nicknamed Cretin, who crashed into him while slamdancing. The crash injured Biafra's leg, causing an argument between the two men. During the argument, Cretin pushed Biafra to the floor and five or six friends of Cretin assaulted Biafra while he was down, yelling \"Sellout rock star, kick him\". Biafra was later hospitalized with serious injuries. The attack derailed Biafra's plans for both a Canadian spoken-word tour and an accompanying album.\n\nIn October of 1998, former members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for not paying them royalties due to them. According to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow the band's most famous single, \"Holiday in Cambodia\", to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because he believes that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. The three former members claim that their motive had nothing to do with advertising, but because Biafra denied them royalties and failed to promote their albums. Biafra maintains that he did not deny them royalties, and in addition, he claimed that he did not receive any royalties on the rereleases of their albums or \"posthumous\" live albums licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership, a charge which Decay Music denies and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks. He also complained about the songwriting credits of the new reissues and archival live albums, which credits songs that Biafra claims he composed the music to on his own to the entire band (contradicting information on BMI's online database[21]). In May 2000, a jury found Biafra liable for fraud and malice and ordered him to pay $200,000, including $20,000 in punitive damages, to the band members. After an appeal by Biafra\u2019s lawyers, in June 2003 the California Court of Appeals unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles.\n\nThe other band members reunited without Biafra under the name of \"DK Kennedys\" (later returning to the original band name), replacing Biafra first with Brandon Cruz, then with Jeff Penalty. Dead Kennedys fans have criticized the new band, owing to Biafra's absence. Biafra himself has also openly criticized his former bandmates' legal tactics and reunion tours, most notably in the song \"Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)\", in which he performed with The Melvins.\n\nIn 1999, Biafra and other members of the anti-globalization movement protested the WTO Meeting of 1999 in Seattle. Along with other famous musicians from the west coast, he formed the short-lived band the No WTO Combo to help promote the movement's cause. The band was originally scheduled to play during the protest, but the performance was canceled due to riots. The band performed the following night at the Showbox in downtown Seattle (outside of the curfew area) where they played a short set. The hiphop group Spearhead also played at the event. A CD containing recordings from the concert, titled Live from the Battle in Seattle, was later released.\n\nIn 2000, the New York State Green Party drafted Biafra as a candidate for the Green Party presidential nomination, and a few supporters were elected to the party's nominating convention in Denver, Colorado. Despite the fact that his address to the convention was positively received, the party overwhelmingly chose Ralph Nader as the presidential candidate. Biafra, along with a camera crew (dubbed by Biafra as \"The Camcorder Truth Jihad\"), later reported for the Independent Media Center at the Republican and Democratic conventions. Biafra detailed these events in his album Become The Media, which has resulted in him being credited with coining the slogan \"Don't hate the media, become the media\". Indymedia and related alternative media often use this line, or the now more apt \"Don't hate the media, be the media.\"\n\nAlso in 2000, Biafra gave the keynote speech at the H.O.P.E. 2000 (\"H2K\") hacker conference. Though Biafra had never used a computer in his life, the attendants saw him as being capable of drawing insightful connections between hacking and activism. He has continued to deliver keynote speeches at every H.O.P.E. conference since, the most recent of which began with him mooning the audience. Audio of these speeches are freely available online for download.\n\nIn April of 2001, Biafra took part in a protest against the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas conference in Quebec.\n\nIn 2005 Biafra appeared on Episode 285 of This American Life, themed \"Know Your Enemy\", which featured a phone call between Jello Biafra and Michael Guarino, the prosecutor in the Frankenchrist trial. The episode was about Guarino's change of opinion and the reconciliation between Guarino and Biafra.\n\nAs of late 2005, Biafra currently performs with the band The Melvins. The new band was dubbed \"Jello Biafra and the Melvins\", though fans often refer to them as \"The Jelvins.\" Together they have released two albums.\n\nIn 2006, along with Alternative Tentacles employee and The Frisk lead singer Jesse Luscious, Biafra began co-hosting The Alternative Tentacles Batcast, a downloadable podcast hosted by alternativetentacles.com. The show primarily focuses on interviews with artists and bands that are currently signed to the Alternative Tentacles label, although there are also occasional episodes where Biafra devoted the show to answering fan questions.\n\nHis eighth spoken word album, In The Grip Of Official Treason, was released in October of 2006.\n\nBiafra has been a prominent member of the Californian hardcore punk scene and, while a member of the Dead Kennedys, was one of the founding members of the San Francisco hardcore punk scene. The Dead Kennedys was one of the first U.S. punk bands to write politically themed songs (possibly inspired by Black Flag, another major Californian hardcore band of the era). The lyrics Biafra wrote with the Dead Kennedys helped popularize the use of humorous lyrics in hardcore. Biafra cites Joey Ramone as the inspiration for his use of humor in his songs (as well as being the musician who made him interested in punk rock), noting in particular songs by The Ramones such as \"Beat On the Brat\" and \"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\". Many later hardcore bands would cite the Dead Kennedys as a major influence. Hardcore punk author Steven Blush describes Biafra as hardcore's \"biggest star\" who was a \"powerful presence whose political insurgence and rabid fandom made him the father figure of a burgeoning subculture (and a) inspirational force (who) could also be a real prick... Biafra was a visionary, incendiary [performer].\"\n\nBiafra initially attempted to compose music on guitar, but his inexperience on the instrument and his own admission of being \"a fumbler with my hands\" led Dead Kennedys bassist Klaus Flouride to suggest that Biafra simply sing the parts he was envisioning to the band. Biafra would later sing his riffs, melodies, and bridges into a tape recorder, which he brought to the band's rehearsal and/or recording sessions. This would later become an issue when the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra over royalties and publishing rights. By all accounts, including his own, Biafra is not a conventionally skilled musician, though he and his collaborators (Joey Shithead of D.O.A. in particular) attest that he is a skilled composer and his work, particularly with the Dead Kennedys, is highly respected by punk-oriented critics and fans.\n\nBiafra's first popular song was the first single by the Dead Kennedys, \"California \u00dcber Alles\". The song, which spoofed California governor Jerry Brown, was the first of many political songs by the group and Biafra. The song's popularity resulted in it being covered by other musicians, such as The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (who rewrote the lyrics to parody Pete Wilson) and John Linnell of They Might Be Giants. Not long afterward, the Dead Kennedys made a second and bigger hit with \"Holiday in Cambodia\", a song about the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from their debut album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables. All Music Guide cites this song as \"possibly the most successful single of the American hardcore scene\" and Biafra counts it as his personal favorite Dead Kennedys song. Minor hits from the album included \"Kill the Poor\" (about potential abuse of the then-new neutron bomb) and a satirical cover of Elvis Presley's \"Viva Las Vegas\".\n\nThe Dead Kennedys received some controversy in the spring of 1981 over the single \"Too Drunk to Fuck\". The song became a big hit in Britain, and the BBC feared that it would manage to be a big enough hit to appear among the top 30 songs on the national charts, requiring them to play a performance of the song on Top of the Pops. However, the single's popularity was slightly less than what was required, peaking at the 31st position.\n\nLater albums would also contain memorable songs, but with less popularity than the earlier ones. The EP album In God We Trust, Inc. contained the song \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off!\" as well as \"We've Got A Bigger Problem Now\", a rewritten version of \"California \u00dcber Alles\" about Ronald Reagan. Punk scholar Vic Bondi considers the latter song to be the song that \"defined the lyrical agenda of much of hardcore music, and represented its break with punk\". The band's most controversial album, Frankenchrist, brought with it the song \"MTV Get Off the Air\", which accused MTV of promoting poor quality music and sedating the public.\n\nAfter the Dead Kennedys disbanded, Biafra's new songs were recorded with other bands, releasing only spoken word albums as solo projects. These collaborations had less popularity than Biafra's earlier work. However, his song \"That's Progress\", originally recorded with D.O.A. for the album Last Scream Of The Missing Neighbors, received considerable exposure when it appeared on the album Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1.\n\nBiafra is an ardent collector of unusual vinyl records of all kinds, from 50's and 60's ethno-pop recordings by the likes of Les Baxter and Esquivel to vanity pressings that have circulated regionally, to infamous German crooner Heino; he cites his always growing collection as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1993 he gave an interview to RE/Search Publications for their second Incredibly Strange Music book focusing primarily on these records. His heavy interest in such recordings eventually led to Biafra discovering the prolific (and schizophrenic) singer/songwriter/artist Wesley Willis, whom he signed to Alternative Tentacles in 1994, precluding Willis' major label deal with American Recordings. His collection grew so large that on October 1, 2005, Biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual yard sale co-promoted by Alternative Tentacles and held at their warehouse in Emeryville, California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Winston Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8307871.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Campfire Indiefolk", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Bottom Of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "vegan punk rock acoustic songs, est. 2014", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "250 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Michelle Musial", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9192649.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.402096, 37.78236], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Left-Field house, Chicago House, Deep House, Progressive House, Techno, Tropical", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "The Commons Club SF", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Napa, CA", "Artist": "Sean Carscadden Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6877491.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2855, 38.2971], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Blues, New Orleans Funk", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Private event ", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "8252 Earhart Rd, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "Rafa Ramos", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.21217, 37.7314], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakland Aviation Museum", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "8252 Earhart Rd, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "Arturo Leyva", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8477322.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.21217, 37.7314], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Latin, Regional Mexicano, World", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakland Aviation Museum", "moreBioInfo": "Pagina oficial del Cantautor & Productor Arturo Leyva autor de temas como Le Hace Falta Un Beso, Aqu\u00ed Estar\u00e9, Embrujado entre muchos mas.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "600 Stockton St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Sam Johnson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9124994.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.406829, 37.791845], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: The California Sound, Rock, Pop, Reggae", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz-Carlton, San Francisco", "moreBioInfo": "Sam Johnson\u2019s love for music goes back to his adolescent years, when he learned Bob Marley and Sublime songs on hand me down instruments, and started a reggae band at his high school in Huntington Beach, California. This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

He brings his inimitable style to stages all over the world, performing regularly with the Yosvany Terry Quartet and Yosvany Terry and the Afro-Caribbean Quintet, as well as with the Gonzalo Rubalcaba Quintet and Eddie Palmieri and the Latin Jazz Ensemble. Yosvany has also worked with some of the biggest names in the business, including Roy Hargrove, Steve Coleman, Chucho Valdes, Silvio Rodriguez, Branford Marsalis, Paquito de Rivera, Dave Douglas, Jeff \u201cTain\u201d Watts, Avishai Cohen, Meshell Ndegeocello, Cassandra Wilson, Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, Wycliffe Gordon, Dafnis Prieto, Taj Mahal, Giovanni Hidalgo, David Murray, Joe Lovano, and Paul Simon. His current project, \u201cToday\u2019s Opinion\u201d (Criss Cross, April 2012), is his second solo album. The project continues the exciting trajectory he established in Latin jazz as a \u201cyoung composer and bandleader with a distinctive personal vision\u201d with his inaugural release Metamorphosis (Ewe Records 2005). Earlier, with his group Columna B he recorded Twisted Noon and Enclave. Yosvany has also been featured on the CDs of Avishai Cohen (At Home, Lylaand Unity), Steve Coleman (Genesis and The Sign and the Seal), Brian Lynch (the Grammy-Award winning Con Clave 2) and Gonzalo Rubalcaba (Avatar). Yosvany, who is also a talented cheker\u00e9 player, received his earliest training from his father, Eladio \u201cDon Pancho\u201d Terry, violinist and Cuba\u2019s leading player of the cheker\u00e9. After mastering this Afro-Cuban percussion instrument, he went on to receive his classical music training from the prestigious National School of Arts (ENA) and Amadeo Roldan Conservatory in Havana. Among the many commissions he has received as a composer are the Chamber Music America \u201cConnecting Communities Residency Program\u201d commission funded through Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, in collaboration with Jazzmobile and Harlem Stage; Harlem Stage\u2019s \u201cMeet the Composer for New Music\u201d commission to write the music of the Opera Makandal; and the Jerome Foundation/Jazz Gallery Composers\u2019 Series commission for a work for a large ensemble.

Yerba Buena Garden Festival commissioned the suite \u201cNoches de Parranda\u201d for 12 piece ensemble with the support of Map Fund. Terry has taught at prestigious institutions across the United States and Canada. He is a lecturer at Princeton University, a faculty member at New York City\u2019s New School University and the Harlem School of the Arts, and has served as a resident instructor at the Stanford Jazz Workshop at Stanford University since 1995.

Born in Quebec City, Quebec, MacDonald started out performing in comedy clubs across Canada before he decided to pack his bags and move to Los Angeles. His wry style landed him gigs writing for the popular sitcom Roseanne along with The Dennis Miller Show, but a 1993 offer to write for SNL had him switching coasts and moving to New York City. A year later he was hosting the show's Weekend Update segment, delivering deadpan jokes about prison rape and crack whores that sometime received more gasps than laughs. Original Weekend Update host Chevy Chase declared him the best \"fake anchor\" he had ever seen, and while a cult of MacDonald fans was growing, the West Coast president of NBC, Don Ohlmeyer, was certainly not one of them. Ohlmeyer pressured Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels to fire MacDonald on the grounds he was \"not funny.\" MacDonald was off Weekend Update in 1997 and completely off the show in 1998, the same year he made his feature film debut with the genuine bomb Dirty Work.\n\nIn 1999 he landed a sitcom on ABC titled simply Norm. The show -- which featured his good friend and future Howard Stern sidekick Artie Lange -- struggled for three years to find an audience before it was canceled. During this time he starred in another silver screen bomb, Screwed, which was released in 2000. In 2003 he was given another chance at sitcoms with the Fox project A Minute with Stan Hooper, which only lasted six episodes despite critics' praise. He kept a low profile for the next couple years with a few talk show appearances here and there, most of them on Stern's show, where MacDonald would discuss his beloved gambling. Standup appearances around the U.S. also kept him busy until 2006, when he finished his first album. Nine years in the making, Ridiculous bucked the unambitious trend most comedy albums were following -- being nothing more than the audio companions to live performance DVDs -- and presented 12 sketches with guests like Will Ferrell, Artie Lange, Tim Meadows, and Molly Shannon. The album was released by the Comedy Central label and produced by Brooks Arthur, the man behind Adam Sandler's successful series of sketch comedy albums.", "otherInfo": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL Two item minimum purchase required.

Covering the obscene and praising the perverse, extreme Death Metal still reigns as the driving force that continues to devour all other forms of hard rock. As each year passes in this brutal movement, it becomes increasingly difficult to find suitable leaders to carry the torch and continue to entice and surprise an audience that certainly isn\u2019t shocked or impressed by much. That search has ended. Allow us to introduce CARNIFEX. Derived from the Old English word for executioner, their moniker could not be more appropriate. It\u2019s a word that reeks of death and destruction from the Dark Ages to describe a fiercely morbid death metal band. It\u2019s hard to imagine that San Diego \u2013 known for its white sand beaches, endless sunny days and astronomical real estate- is also home to the brutal beat down that is CARNIFEX.\n\nIn 2005, vocalist Scott Lewis had a chance meeting with like-minded, gifted drummer Shawn Cameron. Having both played in a countless number of bands over the years that just didn\u2019t seem to fit, the connection between the two was felt instantly. Together, they began a search to fill the musical void that had existed in each of their lives. They quickly formed a group and hit the road. CARNIFEX, being the serious-minded musicians that they are, hit the road hard. Refusing to be another \u201chere today, gone tomorrow\u201d trend, CARNIFEX let nothing stop them from perfecting their live show, touring relentlessly, and writing brainsick, yet intelligent, songs. Having endured everything from tour cancellations, van breakdowns and inevitable line-up changes, that \u201cmagical fit\u201d was solidified by the end of 2007. Scott and Shawn were complemented by the intensity of guitarist Cory Arford. Bassist Fred Calderon rounded out the furious unstoppable juggernaut.\n\nThe non-stop touring and methodical songwriting eventually resulted in CARNIFEX selling over 15,000 copies of their first full-length album, Dead in My Arms, with little publicity. Not surprisingly, industry types started to notice; however, none as quickly as Victory Records. Having spent a lot of time writing during the previous year, CARNIFEX was primed to get into the studio to begin the masterpiece that is The Diseased and the Poisoned. Zeuss (UNEARTH, SHADOWS FALL, HATEBREED) at Planet Z Studios was a natural choice for producer, and they entered the studio rapidly and intently.\n\nCARNIFEX is something musically unique. What really makes CARNIFEX stand out from the throngs of other hard rock acts currently scouring the planet are their savage live performances. Their declaration to make every night an experience for fans rather than just a show has proven to be the most appreciated trait of the band among fans. But you can keep your pyrotechnics and other special effects at home CARNIFEX relies solely on the power of their music. \u201cEvery night, we strive to play extremely tight. Sometimes it can be difficult to make such an intense show so interactive, but we make sure that\neveryone is getting involved,\u201d says Lewis.\n\nIn 2008, CARNIFEX proudly delivered the The Diseased and the Poisoned to the metal masses. Intriguing and armed to the teeth with an arsenal of blast beats, machine gun riffs and vocals exorcised from the deepest pits of hell, The Diseased and the Poisoned is the soundtrack to your worst nightmare. Having sold 28,000 copies in the U.S. alone, this record was a huge success, solidifying their spot in the American Death Metal realm.\n\nIn 2010, CARNIFEX released Hell Chose Me, taking a darker and more blasphemous approach to their already visceral sound. Musical growth and a higher level of aggression coupled with themes of despair and isolation make for an abrasive new record. Blood curdling screams, guttural growls, bottom heavy baselines, and razorsharp guitar riffs make for dark and brutal work.\n\nAfter a short hiatus, CARNIFEX is back stronger than ever and with a new home. \u201cSigning with Nuclear Blast is a career defining moment for CARNIFEX,\u201d states Lewis. \u201cTo be aligned with the largest metal label on earth is a true honor. This world-wide deal signals a turning point for us as a band and individuals. Together with Nuclear Blast you will see CARNIFEX like you have never seen us before. Prepare yourself for an album that crushes any and all expectations. An album that will stand as the definitive mark for modern metal.\u201d\n\nDie Without Hope marks the long awaited return of the band, with their fifth full-length album and Nuclear Blast debut. 10 tracks and over 35 minutes of crushing metal that no fan of heavy music can deny. Recorded at Audiohammer Studios in Sanford, FL and produced by the esteemed Mark Lewis (ARSIS, THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, WHITECHAPEL, DEVILDRIVER, DEICIDE, SIX FEET UNDER), San Diego's finest metal export deliver an album that stands as a definitive cornerstone for modern death metal. Since their formation, CARNIFEX has proven time and time again that their die-hard fan base combined with their DIY work ethic is unmatched; Die Without Hope is no exception.\n\nCARNIFEX\u2019s relentless touring schedule begins with an extensive 5 week headlining tour February 21st though March 29th. Taking the band through all of North America.

Over the course of two years, as their songwriting developed, they began to incorporate influences from different eras of jazz and pop music, which led to the creation of their unique, vibrant, \u201csophisticated but playful\u201d sound (BuzzBands LA). \u201cHis guitar shimmies and swings like Django Reinhardt while her voice wraps around each note, swaying in unison like a modern-day Ella Fitzgerald.\u201d (Nooga).

After\nthe Gay Gay\u2019s went on hiatus, Freeman moved forward with forming a band that could be as\ngood as AC/DC.\n\nFreeman began by recruiting lightning-speed guitarist, Steve McKnight after meeting him online\nand sharing similar musical tastes. McKnight has been a part of the LA music scene since the\nlate \u201880s in Cry Wolf, a melodic hard rock band that made their mark on the Sunset Strip and\nbeyond with several major albums under their belt.\n\nAlso recruited was Karl Rumpf on rhythm guitar, who Freeman had met while on tour with\nPansy Division and later worked with in a band/project called Dart. Rumpf was also in the last\nincarnation of the Gay Gay\u2019s, along with drummer Brian Welch who Freeman had also met\nwhile on tour. Welch had spent years touring with Extreme as their drum tech, so he was a\nnatural fit.\n\nThis four-piece spent months looking for a gay vocalist to no avail. Finally, Freeman asked the\nothers if HE could audition. Nervously, he did, the band agreed, and they were off\u2014but now\nthey needed a bassist, so Freeman recruited bass player extraordinaire, Glen Pavan, once again\nsomeone Freeman had met while on tour. Pavan had previously been keeping the low end down\nfor LA queer punk rockers Best Revenge (who got their name from a Pansy Division song).\n\nNow in their second year as a band, the word of mouth has been intense, even scoring a \u201cpick of\nthe week\u201d in LA Weekly for a recent LA gig.\n\nThe band remains true to the music (working diligently to replicate the actual sound of AC/DC),\nwhile playing around with the lyrics and changing pronouns to suit the gay angle. Hence, TNT\nbecomes PNP (a song about the \u201cparty-n-play\u201d status some gay men post in their online sex ads),\nBad Boy Boogie becomes Gay Boy Boogie (do you really need to ask?), and Big Balls needed\n\u2026 no changing at all!\n\nTo say the band is off-the-hook live is an understatement.

She is known for her virtuosic technique, energetic live performances and blend of musical genres such as jazz, progressive rock, classical and fusion in her compositions. She performs as a trio alongside bassist Tony Grey and drummer Martin Valihora. On October 19, 2006, the trio added guitarist David Fiuczynski (from the Screaming Headless Torsos), to form Hiromi's Sonicbloom. Hiromi's official website is located at http://www.hiromimusic.com.\n\nHiromi first mesmerized the jazz community with her 2003 Telarc debut, Another Mind. The buzz started by her first album spread all the way back to her native Japan, where Another Mind shipped gold (100,000 units) and received the Recording Industry Association of Japan's (RIAJ) Jazz Album of the Year Award. The keyboardist/composer's second release, Brain, won the Horizon Award at the 2004 Surround Music Awards, Swing Journal's New Star Award, Jazz Life's Gold Album, HMV Japan's Best Japanese Jazz Album, and the Japan Music Pen Club's Japanese Artist Award (the JMPC is a classical/jazz journalists club). Brain was also named Album of the Year in Swing Journal's 2005 Readers Poll. In 2006, Hiromi won Best Jazz Act at the Boston Music Awards and the Guinness Jazz Festival's Rising Star Award. She also claimed Jazzman of the Year, Pianist of the Year and Album of the Year in Swing Journal Japan's Readers Poll for her 2006 release, Spiral. Hiromi continues her winning streak as Hiromi's Sonicbloom with the 2007 release of Time Control and her 2008 release of Beyond Standard.\n\nBorn in Shizuoka, Japan, in 1979, Hiromi took her first piano lessons at age six. She learned from her earliest teacher to tap into the intuitive as well as the technical aspects of music.\n\n\"Her energy was always so high, and she was so emotional,\" Hiromi says of her first piano teacher. \"When she wanted me to play with a certain kind of dynamics, she wouldn't say it with technical terms. If the piece was something passionate, she would say, 'Play red.' Or if it was something mellow, she would say, 'Play blue.' I could really play from my heart that way, and not just from my ears.\"\n\nHiromi took that intuitive approach a step further when she enrolled in the Yamaha School of Music less then a year after her first piano lessons. By age 12, she was performing in public, sometimes with very high-profile orchestras. \"When I was 14, I went to Czechoslovakia and played with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra,\" she says. \"That was a great experience, to play with such a professional orchestra.\"\n\nFurther into her teens, her tastes expanded to include jazz as well as classical music. A chance meeting with Chick Corea when she was 17 led to a performance with the well-known jazz pianist the very next day.\n\n\"It was in Tokyo,\" Hiromi recalls. \"He was doing something at Yamaha, and I was visiting Tokyo at the time to take some lessons. I talked to some teachers and said that I really wanted to see him. I sat down with him, and he said 'Play something.' So I played something, and then he said, 'Can you improvise?' I told him I could, and we did some two-piano improvisations. Then he asked me if I was free the next day. I told him I was, and he said, 'Well, I have a concert tomorrow. Why don't you come?' So I went there, and he called my name at the end of the concert, and we did some improvisations together.\"\n\nAfter a couple years of writing advertising jingles for Nissan and a few other high-profile Japanese companies, Hiromi came to the United States in 1999 to study at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. For as open as her musical sensibilities had already been when she came to the U.S., the Berklee experience pushed her envelope even further.\n\n\"It expanded so much the way I see music,\" she says. \"Some people dig jazz, some people dig classical music, some people dig rock. Everyone is so concerned about who they like. They always say, 'This guy is the best,' 'No, this guy is the best.' But I think everyone is great. I really don't have barriers to any type of music. I could listen to everything from metal to classical music to anything else.\"\n\nAmong her mentors at Berklee was veteran jazz bassist Richard Evans, who teaches arranging and orchestration. Evans co-produced Another Mind, her Telarc debut, with longtime friend and collaborator Ahmad Jamal, who has also taken a personal interest in Hiromi's artistic development. \"She is nothing short of amazing,\" says Jamal. \"Her music, together with her overwhelming charm and spirit, causes her to soar to unimaginable musical heights.\"\n\nAt 26, Hiromi stands at the threshold of limitless possibility, constantly drawing inspiration from virtually everyone and everything around her. Her list of influences, like her music itself, is boundless. \"I love Johann Sebastian Bach, I love Oscar Peterson, I love Franz Liszt, I love Ahmad Jamal,\" she says. \"I also love people like Sly & The Family Stone, Dream Theater and King Crimson. Also, I'm so much inspired by sports players like Carl Lewis and Michael Jordan. Basically, I'm inspired by anyone who has big, big energy. They really come straight to my heart.\"\n\nBut she won't, as a matter of principle, put labels on her music. She'll continue to follow whatever moves her, and leave the definitions to others.\n\n\"I don't want to put a name on my music,\" she says. \"Other people can put a name on what I do. It's just the union of what I've been listening to and what I've been learning. It has some elements of classical music, it has some rock, it has some jazz, but I don't want to give it a name.\"", "otherInfo": "Hiromi No pianist alive imbues the solo piano format with more explosive virtuosity or thrilling unpredictability than Hiromi Uehara \u2013 a GRAMMY-winning artist the All Music Guide calls \u201cone of the most remarkable pianists of the past half century.\u201d A prodigious talent who debuted with the Czech Philharmonic at 14, the Hamamatsu, Japan native was mentored by Chick Corea and Ahmad Jamal early in her development, signing her first record deal with Telarc before graduating from Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music."}, {"Address": "400 Eddy St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Keyon Harrold", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.414392, 37.78382], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Black Cat", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "3x Grammy Winner KEYON HARROLD!"}, {"Address": "15400 Montalvo Rd, Saratoga, CA 95071", "Artist": "Steel Betty", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8342254.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.02891, 37.246359], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Acoustic, Folk, Quiet Grass", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Montalvo Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "The Boys and Girl in the Band\n\nSinger, guitarist, and frontman Dave McDonald is a professional musician born and raised in Austin Texas.

Sarah Peacock bridges gaps between Country, Blues, Americana, and Rock-N-Roll. Her music is raw and truth telling, sometimes with kindness, sometimes with a dark side, but always fiercely unique. Essentially, at all times, Peacock is victoriously defeating the forces of evil with glorious Amazonian strength, passion, and determination.\n\nHeld hostage by a record label at 21, the troubadour life came with a rude awakening for the young Georgia native. Peacock made her home in a \u201892 Volvo with her dog and a guitar, and for nearly seven years earned a living in the corner shadows of American dive bars.\n\nThe tables turned in 2011 when an anonymous fan helped her buy out her recording contract. Since then she has released six albums, winning multiple awards for her songwriting. \u201cHurricane\u201d won Best Song in the American Songwriting Awards, and \u201cBeautiful\u201d was a winner with International Unsigned Only. \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d and \u201cAre We There Yet\u201d have nominated her for Best Female Artist and Best Song in a number of songwriting competitions. Peacock was also named Listening Room Network\u2019s Artist of the Year.\n\nBut the dark side takes another swing. And, big Nashville promises are especially good at grave digging. From RCA Studio A golden child to street orphan practically overnight, Peacock was ghosted by her entire team and producer without explanation. Spirits crushed, she hit the road. Solo. Again. That was the catalyst that launched her next album, \u201cDream On,\u201d and landed Sarah her first tour bus. But less than 4 months later, she was watching it burn to the ground at a California truck stop. Sarah\u2019s fans quickly came to the rescue with a fundraiser, which is what kept her on the road. That special connection between Sarah and her fans is what put her in Hank Williams Jr.\u2019s former tour bus, one year after the devastating loss. \u201cYou have to be unstoppable, even when you don\u2019t believe you are.\u201d That\u2019s the Modus Operandi for the now half Tennessean, half Texan road warrior.\n\nWhen she\u2019s off the road, Peacock is active in the anti-bullying and animal rescue communities. She helped start a rock school for kids and recently formed her own 501(c)3, The Band Waggin,\u2019 benefiting animal health and rescue programs.\n\nIn 2017, she signed with In Tune Entertainment and American Roots Records. Peacock is sponsored by Taylor Guitars, Fender, 1964 Audio, Strymon, and Mississippi Cold Drip Coffee.

Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to James Taylor.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. Early concerts consisted of both originals and cover songs, including Guns N' Roses's \"Patience\" and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts theme \"Linus and Lucy.\"\n\nIn mid-1998, after only 8 months together, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as \"Divisions\" and \"All in Time.\"\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar).\n\nThe band released another live album, One Fat Sucka, which contained live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, the first annual Bonnaroo Festival took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date. They would go on to play Bonnaroo in 2004 and again in 2006.\n\nThe band almost ended in late 2002 when drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving the band to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.\n\nIn 2004, the band released the critically acclaimed Anchor Drops, and released Safety in Numbers two years later in April 2006.\n\nIn April, 2007, Umphrey's released their fifth studio effort, The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions. The album was supported with tours of the USA, Europe, and Japan.\n\nBrendan Bayliss is also working on a studio album with Jeff Austin of Yonder Mountain String Band.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Mortified", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Death Metal, Metal", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "MORTIFIED,formed in 2003,playing metal music wich containing black metal,grind,and proggresif riff.we built this band in 2003 in otherhand it named MORTIFIED in 2005..living in bandung metal scene till this time,,,please listen our music and add comment", "otherInfo": "Doors 6:30 / Show 7:30 // $23 DOOR COVER // ALL SALES ARE FINAL"}, {"Address": "Berkeley, CA", "Artist": "Vantana Row", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9025870.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2729, 37.8708], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Powerviolence, Crustwave", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "DRIVE BY PUSSY RIOT & DELI GIRLS", "moreBioInfo": "Vantana Row is an American Crustwave duo, written up in SF Weekly, East Bay Express, and WorldStarHipHop for their gimmicky drive-by performances, living in their van, their YouTube sitcom and their #iwriteforvantanarow program.", "otherInfo": "7PM + 730PM + 8PM + 830PM\nThe UC Theatre\nBerkeley, CA\n\nWe will be passing the outside line several times.\nDrive By time's subject to change, follow @vantanarow on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram for announcements and updates regarding each eta"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Pussy Riot", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618563.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The UC Theatre Presents: Pussy Riot LIVE"}, {"Address": "1600 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "The Blind Owls", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8477914.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399885, 37.765168], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rock n roll, roll, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Thee Parkside", "moreBioInfo": "The Blind Owls are a 4-piece Rock n' Roll band from Corpus Christi, Texas formed in 2012.

Her work is reflective of transitions, the wilderness, and its navigation. Sometimes she plays banjo, other times acoustic guitar. Often, she plays a Telecaster fronting her band, The Home Team, featuring pedal steel (Tim Marcus), drums (Nick Cobbett), bass (Oscar Westesson), and various other Bay Area musicians.\nDuring her ten years in San Francisco, McFarling has released five independent recordings: studio albums, Distractible Child (2010) and Ridgeline (2013), an EP of cover songs, Others (2013), and two live albums, Live at Pirate Ship Laguna (2009) and Live at Eddie\u2019s Attic (2011). She has toured behind her own projects as well as performing with bands like Y La Bamba and Goodnight Texas, and is one-third of the all-female folk trio Glittersnatch with Megan Keely and Wolf Larsen. Over the years, McFarling has shared the stage with artists such as Shovels and Rope, Sean Hayes, Chris Pureka, Jolie Holland, and has made a home for herself in the San Francisco music community.\nWater Dog, McFarling\u2019s latest release, is her most intimate and folk-leaning record to date. She recorded the album in seasonal segments of 2016. The songs were first demoed with Allen Rothschild in his bedroom in Asheville, NC, where the creaks of his wood floor and the sounds of summer winding down made their way onto the recordings through open windows and live takes.The demos became the foundation of the record, and McFarling took them back to San Francisco, where Avi Vinocur of Goodnight Texas produced and engineered the majority of the record at his home in the Sunset District. \u201cRecording at Avi\u2019s house gave us the time to let the songs breathe and evolve.\u201d McFarling said of the process. \u201cIt gave us space to make decisions at our own pace. I\u2019ve never made a record like that, and it was a really special time. These songs were written in quiet spaces that were lived in. It made sense to record them in that way.\u201d\nThe album is a reflection on inward motion; on the way that water and its movement dominates our lives and bodies. It\u2019s about love, trust, and how we come to know the things we know. Above all, it\u2019s about the cycles of nature that have the power to be both grounding and destructive. \u201cWhile I was writing these songs, I was thinking a lot about family, stability, and love; and I was simultaneously starting to spend more time in and around the ocean. I was getting in the water a lot, and it opened a conversation about the nature of flow; learning to move with changes, instead of against them.\u201d\nIn addition to producing, Vinocur also plays on most of Water Dog and his work is prominent on signature tracks, like \u201cBoth.\u201d \u201cThat song was totally different when I brought it in. Avi simplified the groove, and made it more compelling.\u201d says McFarling. Vinocur also helped complete the writing of \u201cCaney Fork Overlook,\u201d one of the record\u2019s more classic country tunes. \u201cThat song had been half written for years. I wrote it in my van while on a road trip on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it was one of those songs that I never had expectations for. I wasn\u2019t sure it would be on the record. Avi helped get it to a place where it shines.\u201d In other more stripped down songs, McFarling often played live in one take. \u201cThe Storms are Getting Stronger,\u201d \u201cSpring Clean\u201d, and \u201cBox\u201d are songs that have been played in many different arrangements, mostly upbeat with a full band. For the recordings, I wanted them to go back to what they were when they were first written. Simple, quiet folk songs.\u201d\nAlthough Vinocur and McFarling play the bulk of the instrumentation on the record, they also tapped several trusted Bay Area musicians to explore additional layers of sonic texture. Water Dog features Tim Marcus on pedal steel and dobro, Graham Patzner on fiddle, Andrew Laubacher on percussion, Andrew Brennan on guitars, Oscar Westesson on upright bass, and John Elliott on piano. Austin-based band Whiskey Shivers also makes an appearance singing backup vocals on \u201cCaney Fork Overlook.\u201d\nWater Dog is a first for McFarling in many ways. It is the first record she has made without a band, the first time she approached recording without a deadline, and the first time she has explored stripped down instrumentation. \u201cFrom the beginning, the idea was always to let the songs speak for themselves and try not to get in the way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "With The Lowatters // $15 // 8pm-midnight"}, {"Address": "1111 OFarrell Street, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "SF", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.423286, 37.784249], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "St. Marks Lutheran Church", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Unauthorized Rolling Stones", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8492095.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Tribute Band", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "Their show holds in reverence many legends of the classic rock years, while maintaining their Rolling Stones core.

But life is too short and friends/musicians are too plenty not to enhance the writing with a more traditional band sound: drums, bass, keys, horns, etc. With Yes Yes Okay Okay, Olin has discovered a perfect synthesis of intimate songwriting with enhanced, rule breaking instrumentation that one usually associates with the likes of Wilco and others. Perhaps more than ever, Olin's music sounds like the man behind it: utterly sincere, slightly off kilter, instantly likable.

The band\u2019s stellar live performances have become a thing of wonder and have seen the band share stages with contemporary artists such as Sleepy Sun, Dead Meadow, Witchcraft, Pentagram, Black Mountain, Wooden Shjips, and High On Fire to name a few. The release of New Rituals (Alive Records), saw the band touring the US extensively, appearing at many high-profile fests around the country including several official showcases at SXSW (and a dozen more unofficial ones) and headlining slots at both the Chicago Pysch Fest and the Cincy Psych Fest. You can also find them on the Austin Psych Fest 3 DVD (w/ The Black Angels, The Warlocks, Warpaint, et al.). The band caravanned across the country last year, settling in Oakland, CA. They will be releasing their 2nd LP this year, which features the rhythm section of fast-rising Swedish-American rock band Blues Pills (Nuclear Blast). Stay tuned\u2026 -------- MONDO DRAG New Rituals REVIEWS Like a modern-day Hawkwind, Mondo Drag fall from the cosmos with the spaced-out 60\u2019s psychedelia of the title track. It\u2019s the sound of UFO\u2019s visiting an outdoor rock concert with an audience of stoned bikers and damaged post-Pink Floyd space travelers. That is to say, it\u2019s great! Moving on from there, \"Love Me (Like A Stranger)\" dares to meld Black Sabbath with early Syd-era Floyd, to wondrously lysergic sludge-rock effect. \"Come Through\" is on a similar flight path as the Brian Jonestown Massacre, with it\u2019s laid-back blissed-out vibe. \"Serpent Shake\" revs it up with a driving riff mantra. These are the true children of the bong, and \"New Rituals\" is a powerhouse stoner-rock album that reaches back to the past and brings it back to the future, bleary-eyed and on a whole different kinda trip. \u2013 Goatsden \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Mondo Drag (consisting of Cluney, vocalist/guitarist Nolan Girard, guitarist Jake Sheley, bassist Dennis Hockaday and keyboardist John Gamino) seems to always have us out in a hot and hungry desert, stripped of our sanity, drained of our better senses and swirling in a purple-y groove, just trying to start seeing straight again. It\u2019s partly a freakout and partly something we ingested or smoked, bringing on the sensations willingly \u2013 feeling disjointed and paranoid, spinning in circles. We hear wolves crying, \"KILL,\" in the twilight, off in the distance. We never cease to feel the heat burning through us and we\u2019re starting to think that the cactuses and the abandoned steer skulls resting in the sand are trying to speak to us. These are all hallucinations working on us, spreading over us like streaky moonlight and a bad trip. Actually, it\u2019s more like a good trip because this one won\u2019t leave you sleeping with chickens, chewing your pillows as if they were made of breasts or meatloaf or wearing pantyhose, lipstick and nothing else. It\u2019s a trip that you would like never to end, to just keep roiling and rolling, tumbling \u2013 heating up, melting, slowing down, idling and then blasting again on all cylinders. \"New Rituals\" is an album that will bring you to that place that you\u2019re always hoping to get to on a night when you\u2019re hitting the town, trying to cut loose and pretend as if you\u2019re not just out there trying to make ends meet, but are actually as satisfied and well off as you need to be, simply because you\u2019re feeling like THIS. It\u2019s all tingly and throbbing and LOUD and we\u2019re happy to drown in this syrup. \u2013 The Wolves And The Hallucinogens Are Crying Kill / Daytrotter Session \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \"This sound is massive reverberating vocal sounds crooned over lush hot fire fuzzed trance riffs and hazy atmospheric analog FX-ed space rock \u2018n\u2019 roll melted into feedback-drenched electro-oscillating freak-out jams spliced with organ-heavy garage-punk stomp parts, dark and dreamy synth-prog buildups with folky acoustic ragas and filthy blues slides. We try to pay homage to the forefathers but drag it down its own direction, a new cross-bred path untraveled, good jams, basically.\" \u2013 Mondo Drag interview for SXSW 2010 Spinner \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Mondo Drag\u2019s 11-track sonic adventure needs multiple listens to take it all in. The band hits you with an approach that lands somewhere between The Doors and Jane\u2019s Addiction \u2013 hints of Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd in there too \u2013 with songs that are more musically-driven than lyrically-dominated. The disc opens up with a 40-second wave of feedback kicking off the nine-minute title track. By the time the drums get rolling, the guitar licks soak in and the keyboards march through in some kind of beach music send-off, the music as a whole has already started to melt your face off. Haunting vocals from drummer/singer Johnnie Cluney and guitarist/singer Nolan Girard carry the listener further as blues guitar jams are unleashed. It\u2019s psychedelic rock with a raw heart that mixes up the genres without the polish or attitude, as if some band from the \u201970s woke up in 2010 and decided there really was no reason to grow with the time and just do what they do best. And that\u2019s just the first track! Hints of saxophone are complimentary instead of a distraction on the bluesy, Hendrix-esque \"Light As a Feather.\" \"Fade Out\" sounds like Perry Farrell singing over a Hendrix-ian groove. \"Love Me (Like a Stranger)\" adds in a smattering of The Mars Volta. The band gets acoustic on \"Come Through\" and \"Black River.\" \u2013 Jeff Hanhe / Creative Loafing \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Opening Mondo Drag\u2019s new CD, \u201cNew Rituals,\u201d is like opening a time capsule from the classic rock vaults of the late 1960s and early 1970s. From the artwork to the music, so psychedelic and grungy is this Davenport band\u2019s garage rock that you can almost smell the pot. Still, no amount of incense could cover up the unabashed stoner rock performed by Johnnie Cluney, Nolan Girard, John Gamino, Dennis Hockaday and Jake Sheley as they lead listeners on a musical journey over the course of 11 original songs that blend psychedelic, progressive, metal and blues-rock to good effect. The list of iconic sounds and performers they conjure up is too long to list, but highlights include the funky \u201cLight As A Feather,\u201d the ballads \u201cCome Through\u201d and \u201cTrue Visions\u201d and dark rockers \u201cApple\u201d and \u201cTallest Tales.\u201d \u2013 Michael Swanger / City View \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- The band displays the usual plumage on New Rituals \u2013 distortion and feedback, hazy melodies, a dreamlike atmosphere, acoustic ephemera. But despite treading well-worn ground, the Draggers make it sound fresh, rather than hackneyed \u2013 likely the virtue of having no scene to get lost in. Muscular and melodic, Mondo Drag kicks out the new/old jams. \u2013 Michael Toland / Big Takeover \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u201cNew Rituals\u201d has become a favorite from the first listen and probably will be for most fans of psychedelic rock. The album begins with the title track. The intro is really spacey, slowly gaining focus until it explodes into this sun drenched surf rock stomp with awesome keys. The vocals are very smooth but the real focus is on the music. Expect a lot of interstellar jams throughout. \u201cFade Out (Into Space)\u201d hits you immediately with a powerful groove and soaring vocals. This is definitely one of the best shorter tracks on the record and has great energy that dissipates in a slow feedback drenched solo. It\u2019s easy to see the band\u2019s influences run deep into the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s haze of Cream, Pink Floyd, Blue Cheer and Hendrix. Speaking of Floyd, \u201cSerpent Shake\u201d and \u201cLove Me (Like a stranger)\u201d makes use of the organ in all the right ways. You couldn\u2019t really ask for better production, it still feels very 60s/70s but without sacrificing any quality. \u201cCome On Through\u201d has a trippy blues vibe going on, it\u2019s very catchy. \u2013 Sputnik Music \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Davenport, Iowa\u2019s Mondo Drag (formerly known as Holy Smokes) are proof that good bands \u2014 and records \u2014 can germinate in the most oddball of surroundings. In fact, their material seems to suggest that what\u2019s needed to make good music is not a hopping music scene so much as a killer record collection. One might guess that Davenport, then, has a plethora of good thrift stores and yard sales given Mondo Drag\u2019s latest release, New Rituals. Filled with five-minute-plus cuts of pure blues/psych/sludge, New Rituals conjures up a stew of influence: early Pink Floyd, Pentagram and, says the band, any of about 20 forever-thought-lost-to-the-ether records the band collectively happens upon in a given week. For a band whose sound can eerily echo some of the better fuzz blooze of days past, there is a consistent growth and newness to each of their releases. (Pink Floyd grew from record to record too, you\u2019ll remember.) Let\u2019s hope Springwater has had a structural engineer pop by in the last year or two \u2014 Mondo err more on the Black Mountain side of psych but don\u2019t forget the Black Sabbath either. \u2013 Timothy C Davis / Nashville Scene \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Deep from the interstellar space of a Pink Floydesk planet (Davenport, Iowa) a spaceship called MONDO DRAG lands on the earth. The heavy psych rockers celebrate NEW RITUALS with a hulking wall of sound, an arsenal of guitars and a head full of clouds. They are on a journey through time from the future into the past to recruit their followers persuading them with extended psychedelic blues guitar jams and haunting vocals over heavy, steady bass lines and thumping percussion. The blue cheering crowd standing on the black mountain freaks out and dance into a transcendent state of trance listening MONDO DRAG\u2019s intoxicating music. Does time run backwards in other universes? Yes, in the MONDO DRAG universe it does. Our universe may be part of a much larger multiverse, which as a whole is time-symmetric. Formed by Johnnie Cluney (drums/vocals), Nolan Girard (rhythm guitar/vocals), John Gamino (keyboards/saxophone), Dennis Hockaday (bass), and Jake Sheley (lead guitar) MONDO DRAG has created a strange brew of garage, psych, space, sludge and stoner rock. Mission accomplished! \u2013 Captain Beyond \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- With minds expanded and set to the key of retro, Davenport, Iowa \u2014 which for those in the know is called \u201cthe San Francisco of Iowa\u201d (that\u2019s not true) \u2014 the high toned Mondo Drag emerge bearing psychedelic sweets that seem to melt as soon as they hit your tongue. There are 11 of them, to be exact, and when packaged together and put in the right order, they make up the band\u2019s Alive Records debut, New Rituals. It\u2019s a record about as thick as the band\u2019s collective sonic moustache, and right from the opening nine-minute title track, you know there\u2019s a freakout bound to happen here. Their heavier moments could be drawing from Graveyard or a less doomed-out Witchcraft, but as change-up tracks like the acoustic-led \u201cBlack River\u201d or \u201cCome Through\u201d demonstrate, there\u2019s more to Mondo Drag than mere aping of \u201870s proto metal. \u201cLove Me\u201d is laced with organ-fused heaviness, and \u201cSerpent Shake\u201d takes a later-\u201860s acid pop feel, once again making use of the organ, but being more rhythm-driven and upbeat. The changes in attack are subtle, but show themselves more distinctly on repeat listens, and though I don\u2019t know if any of the songs on New Rituals ever prove to be catchy in that \u201cstuck in your head\u201d sense of the word, there is a natural feel throughout the album that sustains the enjoyment level for the duration. \u2013 The Obelisk \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- First things first: If you don\u2019t like Black Mountain, old Black Keys, or Pink Floyd\u2019s bluesier material, you won\u2019t like Mondo Drag. Oh, and if you don\u2019t like those things, you also should get the fuck off my blog. Because they\u2019re awesome. Second: Mondo Drag\u2019s latest foray into extended psychedelic, wandering jams that go on for days and days is just as good as anything this band has ever done. Is it self-indulgent? A little. But that\u2019s the price of long, fuzzy blues guitar jams over heavy, steady basslines and thumping percussion. There\u2019s a reason this band has been around for years and survived its name change from \u201cHoly Spirit:\u201d They rock. Most songs clock in at over 6 minutes, yet you don\u2019t notice the time go by because they seem to take that long just to rev up. Each song stretches, cries, screams, and tears itself apart. \u2013 Berkeley Place \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Awake! Mondo Drag has pulled a colloquial language out of the cadavers of forgotten lore making it a harmonious love in for all. (Insert hugs and kisses and tepid fondling). Served on a silver platter for all those educated in existentialism, astral projection,tantra sex and an appreciation for hallucinatory, mind altering drone. Who needs LSD when I have Mondo Drag the Kapellmeister of transcendental meditation. \u2013 SugarBuzz Magazine \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- With this new record, Mondo Drag has something very interesting things occuring musically as they combine vintage sounds from several genres and morph them into something that is unique in today\u2019s rock and roll world. \u2013 Andrew Bryant / Disc Exchange \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Mondo Drag interview with the Quad City Times \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- VERY good psychadelic garage rock\u2026has a really thick 60\u2019s feel\u2026man It is REAL good. Check this out! \u2013 The LP Revival Blog \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Mondo Drag band of the week on Microwaved Milk \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- New Rituals, is a set of tracks with the heavy feel of the hard rock of 1968. True to the eclecticism of that era, Mondo Drag throw in slower tempos here and there and even break out acoustic guitars for songs like \"Come Through\" and \"Black River.\" But they don\u2019t necessarily stay with one tempo or set of chords throughout an entire track, sometimes shifting abruptly to something else, as when the slow closer \"Tallest Tales\" suddenly changes gears for a faster, harder coda to end the disc. One big difference between Mondo Drag\u2019s influences and their own performances is that the band de-emphasizes vocals, which, when they are there at all, are low in the mix and distorted. Large sections of New Rituals are instrumental, making this a psychedelic experience given over to guitar textures and spacy soundscapes. \u2013 All Music Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- HEAVY PSYCH // PROG - OAKLAND CA www.mondodrag.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "MTT", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6360476.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419994, 37.777441], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Synth, Pop, Indie, 80s, Decades, Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Davies Symphony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "[ENGLISH] Having cut their teeth on 80\u2019s new wave, 90\u2019s pop MTT has added deep bass and minimal drums for a more contemporary sound on their sophomore album Years From Now.

[DUTCH] Na een veelgeprezen debuut komt MTT (voorheen Minus The Tiger) in het voorjaar van 2014 met de opvolger, Years From Now. Het sfeervolle, persoonlijke album is zowel muzikaal als inhoudelijk een spannende stap vooruit. Een intensieve periode waarin onder meer de geboorte van een dochter voor een nieuw perspectief zorgde, krijgt een introspectieve, bij vlagen melancholische invulling. Vrees niet, het album blijft ver uit de buurt van een muzikale versie van het wanhopigere segment van de ingezonden brievenrubriek van de Ouders van Nu. Sterker, MTT heeft een knap, doorleefd en urgent album gemaakt, speciaal voor iedereen die weet hoe het voelt als de tijd je door de vingers glipt. De gloedvolle en wonderlijk geslaagde poging de jaren tachtig te mixen met een actuele sound, zijn een voorlopige kroon op de samenwerking tussen zangeres Anne Broekman, producer Maarten Besseling en drummer Jos Terlingen. Het resultaat sluit nog nadrukkelijker aan bij de internationale ambities die de band met het debuut over de grenzen al op de kaart zette.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose.

This mysterious capacity for creativity and rejuvenation under the sea symbolically presents itself again and again in the songs of Dead Reckoning, the take-no- prisoners debut Wicked Cool Records album by Soraia being released October 13. \u201cDead Reckoning is a nautical term meaning that you know where you are in the ocean based not on your location on a map but on where you've already been,\u201d says Soraia singer ZouZou Mansour. \u201cI may not know exactly where I'm headed, but these lyrics are all about who I am today \u2014 the good, bad and ugly.\u201d Tracing threads beginning with the \u201960s soul of Stax and Motown, borrowing flickers of luminescence from rock icons such as Patti Smith and Joan Jett as well as Iggy Pop and The Cramps, through kindred spirits of the \u201990s and beyond like PJ Harvey and The Kills, the primal sounds of this Philadelphia- based four-piece provide a formidable match for a set of mostly autobiographical songs that lead listeners through the depths of desperate situations and guide them out the other side to redemption. \u201cMusic had already saved me from several suicide attempts by the time I was 15, when the lyrics to songs spoke to me and revealed I wasn\u2019t alone in my suffering,\u201d ZouZou reveals. \u201cI knew by that age I was going to do music for a living. \u201cI lived a long time feeling a victim of things: life, people, situations. Powerless. I finally realized I needed connection. That\u2019s where empowerment comes in. My story is about bringing myself back to who I was always meant to be, which required commitment and action. It took action to change my life. And when I committed to and believed in that action, I asked for help where I needed it and continue to check myself and stay humble.\u201d After escaping some harrowing situations and getting sober, the pursuit of ZouZou\u2019s musical dreams began crystallizing in the band Soraia. \u201cSoraia is actually my birth name,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we want it to be how the band is known, because it\u2019s another name for the constellation Pleiades, and generally is taken to mean bright, guiding force or star. Our magic and energy emulate that idea, so it is no longer just the name but a group and the hope and purpose behind what we do. The idea is to give light.\u201d Surrounding ZouZou with boundless talent are bassist and frequent co-writer Travis Smith (\u201cresilient, passionate, with a gift for writing the catchiest riffs I\u2019ve heard from anyone, ever\u201d), guitarist and musical director Mike Reisman (\u201cplays like someone with three times his experience and keeps us centered\u201d) and drummer Brianna Sig (\u201cplays with reckless abandon and precision\u201d). \u201cWhat makes the sound of Soraia,\u201d says ZouZou, \u201cis we all are huge fans of the same legendary artists and bring these strong influences to the table: Travis\u2019 love of The Misfits and garage rock of the \u201960s versus my love of melody and pop, along with influences such as Queen and Led Zeppelin.\u201d The band made waves with their punked up cover of The Kinks\u2019 \u201c(I\u2019m Not) Like Everybody Else,\u201d which hit #1 on rock radio in South America in 2013. Their last independently released album In The Valley Of Love And Guns featured five songs the band co-wrote with Jon Bon Jovi. By this point, the energy emanating from the Soraia constellation had already reached the eyes and ears of renowned tastemaker Steven Van Zandt (The E Street Band, The Sopranos), the Wicked Cool mastermind who has eagerly bestowed Coolest Song In The World honors on five of their tracks since 2013, including his #1 pick of 2016, \u201cElectrocutioner.\u201d They\u2019ve consistently earned heavy rotation on Steven\u2019s weekly syndicated radio show and SiriusXM channel Little Steven\u2019s Underground Garage. Dead Reckoning\u2019s leadoff track \u201cQuicksand\u201d already enjoyed Coolest Song honors in mid-summer 2017. Longtime Rolling Stone editor David Fricke has also attested to his fandom, testifying, \u201cSearing guitars, burning soul and true CBGB grit: Soraia are the rock you need, in your face right now.\u201d The group made the trek up the New Jersey Turnpike in early 2017 to record Dead Reckoning at Van Zandt\u2019s Renegade Nation Studios in downtown New York City. Steven personally produced two of the tracks, one that he wrote for them (\u201cWhy\u201d) and the other an obscure Prince cover, \u201cWow.\u201d The band co- produced the rest of the record with the guidance of Geoff Sanoff [Fountains Of Wayne, Dashboard Confessional]. Finishing touches were provided by boldface studio names: mixes for the Steven-produced tracks by Bob Clearmountain [Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones] and mastering by Bob Ludwig [David Bowie, Neil Young]. As the next release in Wicked Cool Records\u2019 partnership with The Orchard as distributor, Dead Reckoning positions Soraia as an artist to watch. Their rising ambitions are reflected in new horizons they\u2019re setting out to conquer, such as their first European shows, slated for Spain and Germany this fall. \"Dead Reckoning\" - our 12-song album - releases on vinyl, cd, and digital this Friday, October 13th!

The city boasts a proud musical legacy including Sly Stone, MC Hammer, En Vogue, Toni Tony Tone, Too $hort Tupac Shakur, Pete Escovito, Sheila E and countless others. Adrian Marcel picks up the torch for Oakland and timeless R&B on his debut mixtape, 7 Days of Weak. Executive produced and hosted by fellow East Oakland native, modern soul trailblazer and multiplatinum producer Raphael Saadiq. 7 Days of Weak is a true urban contemporary collective of songs. A fusion of traditional R&B, hip-hop, turf and soul music blended together with beautiful melodies and detailed storylines that paint a vivid picture of young man in his early 20's overwhelmed by the realities of love.\n\nMarcel knew he wanted to sing at a young age. He studied music incessantly, learning as much as he could while receiving formal training as a child. His career started to take off as he started to perform locally. With his impressive vocal range and stage swagger, he was immediately compared to Chico DeBarge and Al B! Sure. Marcel accepts the comparisons while remaining true to his own lane. El Seven Recordings and Republic Records saw the talent and truth in his music, which led to his signing in early 2013.\n\nOn his debut single Waiting, he slides from a fluttering falsetto into a bluesy hook as synths pulsate below. It's a formidable introduction into 7 Days of Weak and Marcel\u2019s musical gifts.

Sandoval was voted Cuba\u2019s Best Instrumentalist from 1982 to 1990.\n\nArturo Sandoval has been awarded 4 Grammy Awards, 6 Billboard Awards and an Emmy Award.

He is one of the most dynamic and vivacious live performers of our time, and has recently been seen by millions in the Grammy Awards performing with pop-phenomenon Justin Timberlake as well as on the Latin Billboard Awards with the gifted Alicia Keys, where he was awarded his 6th Billboard Awards for \u201c Best Latin Jazz Album\u201d.\n\nNot only is Arturo a tenured professor at Florida International University, but he works nationally and abroad with innumerable institutions and their music departments offering several scholarships, exercise books, clinics and seminars, and has rendered a considerable amount of time working with the NARAS educational program. Furthermore, Hal Leonard Publishing has not only released additional educations books with recorded CDs that include original exercises by Sandoval, but has published various big band, combo and marching band charts from his award winning albums. Arturo Sandoval maintains one of the most extensive educational programs in the industry.\n\nSandoval is also a renowned classical musician, performing regularly with the leading symphony orchestras from around the world.

In 2001 he was convicted of manslaughter charges even though he maintains his claim of innocence. He is currently serving a 30 year prison term.\n\nHe released his first album under the name Lil' Mac in 1989 at the age of 12, the \"Lyrical Midget,\" receiving production from the then unknown producer Mannie Fresh. Mac would later join the Psychoward, a New Orleans group consisting (at the time) of more than 25 MCs. Psychoward is known (especially in the city) for having a sound that separates itself from the usual Bounce music and gangster/hustler lyrics that typifies most of the New Orleans rap scene, rather focusing on lyricism and a sound which could be described as a New Orleans Wu-Tang Clan. This made them favorites of local \"hip hop heads\" who often prefer this style to other local acts.\n\nMac's own debut on No Limit came with Shell Shocked, an album considered by many to be one of No Limit's best. Mac gained a reputation as one of the south's best lyricists. His lyrics display the somber realism and maturity that is a mainstay in much of Southern Rap as well as the lyrical dexterity of his East Coast counterparts. This album also followed the typical No Limit album formula: the deep, introspective tracks mixed in with up-tempo tracks, and a heavy presence of guest features from No Limit labelmates. His next album, World War III, came on the \"downslope\" of No Limit's fame. It came after Beats By the Pound, No Limit's in-house production team who are often credited with making No Limit the empire it was, left the label over purported money disputes, along with much of No Limit's roster. This may have been a blessing in disguise though, as Mac's lyrical skill was allowed to shine through on production more suited to his style.

A few years later Odetto was a semi-finalist for Guitar Center\u2019s King of the Blues. He was also featured in Guitar Player magazine as an artist to watch. After two successful stints with local bands, in 2016 he decided to pursue his dream of being a frontman.\n\nSince the move to fronting his own band, Tommy has been fortunate to be invited to perform at Bottlerock Napa 2018, and has opened for bands like, Chevy Metal, Tommy Castro, Coco Montoya, Y&T, Walter Trout, Uriah Heep, Ace Frehley, Trainwreck with Kyle Gass (Tenacious D) and Robin Trower to name a few.

Al a\u00f1o siguiente en 1999 sale al mercado su segundo material \u201cDirecto al coraz\u00f3n\u201d, del que destacaron melod\u00edas como: \u201cEsta Navidad\u201d, \u201cTu sabes bien\u201d y \u201cAmada m\u00eda\u201d. Dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez sorprende gratamente a sus seguidores con su tercera producci\u00f3n: \u201cTres palabras\u201d del que se recuerdan cortes como: \u201cMaestra\u201d, \u201cLa vida es un carnaval\u201d, \u201cBella y sin alma\u201d y \u201cTriste Navidad\u201d. Y en el 2003, Mart\u00ednez demuestra y reafirma nuevamente por qu\u00e9 es considerado por la cr\u00edtica como uno de los mejores bachateros del momento con \u201cAs\u00ed te amo\u201d, una exquisita producci\u00f3n que cont\u00f3 con la mano m\u00e1gica en la producci\u00f3n del talentoso maestro Rando Camasta. Temas como \u201cAs\u00ed te amo\u201d, \u201cSerpiente\u201d, \u201cEl profesor\u201d, \u201cDuele, duele\u201d, entre otros, se convirtieron en grandes \u00e9xitos. Elvis Mart\u00ednez ha actuado como bachatero en distintos escenarios, ha logrado ventas enormes de sus discos dentro y fuera de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, Centroam\u00e9rica y Estados Unidos. Pero indudablemente su carisma, su car\u00e1cter espont\u00e1neo y sus ganas de salir adelante, ya desde ahora le auguran un sitio privilegiado dentro de los mejores bachateros del mundo.

It usually goes something like this: Imagine a band that mixes [insert well-known indie band here] with [insert famous pop artist here] sprinkled with a dash of [for intrigue, insert descriptive noun here]. And of course, it's usually complete bullshit. Unless, that is, you're talking about SMASH-UP DERBY.\n\nThat's because SMASH-UP DERBY indeed does do all of the above \u2013 quite literally. In fact, they're a totally kick-ass indie cover band \u2013 except the singers think they're in a pop band. So while the band is cranking out rockin' renditions of songs by Nirvana, Franz Ferdinand, the Sex Pistols, or Black Sabbath, the singers are belting out Madonna, Michael Jackson, Christina Aguilera, or Pink - at the same time.\n\nOn paper, it sounds like a train wreck, but in actuality, it melds beautifully. With the band's skillful execution, these \"hybrid songs\" sound like they were always meant to be together. You'll never hear the originals the same way again.\n\nIt's no surprise to discover that SMASH-UP DERBY was started by none other than singer-turned-DJ Adrian Roberts, who went from fronting the well-known San Francisco glam band Blue Period, to becoming an even more popular mash-up DJ and club promoter. Known mostly for throwing Bootie, the first mashup club in the United States, Adrian first conceived of the band in early 2003, thinking it would be fun to do live versions of the bootleg DJ mixes they had been spinning. He soon recruited ex-Blue Period drummer-turned-DJ Matty C., a.k.a. club Bootie's resident rock mashup DJ Dada, and together they created a band to do a one-off show. But it wasn't until a year later that things really kicked into gear, when they somehow convinced three-fourths of SF hard rock band For Madmen \u2013 guitarists Jamie Cronander and Jason Martinez, and bassist Sam Henry \u2013 to join them in this unholy union of indie rock versus shameless pop.\n\nAfter another show, where the crowd response was overwhelming, they soon realized it was just too much fun to do only once a year. A few months later, they were joined by singer Trixxie Carr, who provided the ideal vocal foil for Adrian. When the two discovered they had both won separate \"Best Ass\" contests, they knew they were destined to be in a band together. Now, Smash-Up Derby has an entire repertoire of bastard pop songs, and have released an eight-song demo CD, which they refuse to sell \u2013 instead, they give it away for free at shows. They pride themselves as being known as the world's only mashup rock band, and have a monthly residency at the DNA Lounge, as the club Bootie house band.\n\nHowever, mashing up the music is only part of what makes SMASH-UP DERBY unique. Their stage presentation makes them one of San Francisco's most exciting bands, with singers Adrian and Trixxie playing off each other, bringing a polished sense of glamour and theatricality to the proceedings. Meanwhile, the band \u2013 to put it bluntly \u2013 simply rock out with their cock out. It's a culture clash that's exciting to watch, and even more exciting to listen to.\n\n(from the official Smash-Up Derby website at www.smashupderby.com)", "otherInfo": "BOOTIE MASHUP: ST.

With an uplifting, almost child-like singing voice, he moves seamlessly between guitar & violin, sometimes making tasteful use of live looping to enhance the listening experience. He's not afraid to tackle difficult topics in his songwriting; Safe Streets is about police violence, Close Your Eyes is about the beauty bias in the mass media, and Random Serenade is about the meaninglessness of life. Featuring vocal harmonies, guitar, electric violin, bass, drums, and live \"looping\u201d.\n\nAdrian started playing violin at the age of four and in his teens studied classical violin at the McGill Conservatory of Music in Montreal. He later learned to play drums, guitar and developed his vocal and songwriting technique.\n\nHe moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1995 where as a sideman violinist he began supporting local Bay Area bands, playing some of the area's better known venues including the Fillmore, Yoshi's SF (main stage), Slim\u2019s, The Independent and The Sweetwater.\n\nWhen Adrian began performing solo, he combined violin, guitar, mandolin, beatboxing and vocals into a live performance that relied heavily on 'looping'. He recorded an all-instrumental demo CD called The One-Man String Quartet which got airplay on Keller Williams' nationally syndicated radio show Keller's Cellar, as well as on Derk Richardson's Hear and Now show on KPFA in Berkeley.\n\nIn 2005 he formed the Adrian West Trio and in 2010 he released his first full-length CD Chameleons and Butterflies.\n\nSince then the band has performed at small venues and festivals all over the Bay Area.\n\nRecently Adrian combined his love of music with his love of science in a multimedia show called An Evening of Music & Science which weaves his music with synchronized videos and presentations on the subject of how life began on Earth. The show was put on twice in Berkeley in 2017 and there are plans for more shows.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "424 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Hella Tight", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.429362, 37.772531], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Underground SF", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Hell'a Tight!\" w/ Lindsay Slowhands"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Dada", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/205960.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sat Mar 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-14", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "BOOTIE MASHUP: ST.

Hip Hop controls his life. This is the precise starting point of his career. Under the pseudonym Dice'C he starts touring as rapper and Urban DJ appearing at the most important clubs in the world. Within a matter of a couple of years he is one of the few German Urban Headline acts opening for Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, jamiroquai and Usher all over Germany. In 1994 he releases his first self produced Hip Hop piece and also sidelines from his ever growing profile and starts branching out into promoting and planning Urban events and Hip Hop areas at Electronica festivals where he begins to make good friends in the house and techno scene. He begins to be present at more and more house parties and clubs and begins to recognize that this new form of music offers him more creative opportunities as a DJ, wowed as he is by the crowd response to the tracks that are dropped.So it begins at \"La Rocca\" where he starts playing house and within a very short space of time it 's impossible to imagine Duesseldorf's vibrant party scene. Within a year he's playing at Tribehouse and this sets the ball rolling that will transform him into a global player.\n\nAfter numerous German appearances, several American tours (North and South), Gigs in the UK, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Dice moved into the studio. Loco Dice's own definition of House Music is \"\"deep, groovy, chunky, driving, 123 Music for the Terrace. Dice really loves the smaller clubs and the Terrace bars under an open sky and this is borne out at both his residencies at DC-10 and Tribehouse. It was at Tribehouse that he was spotted by producer and DJ Timo Maas, and as a fan and a friend he signs Dice to his 4:20 imprint and together with Martin Buttrich and vocalist Phil Barnes they create their first Clubsmash \"Phat Dope Shit\". This is swiftly followed by remixes of \"Help Me\" by Timo Maas and \"Toscana\" by Mousse T initially just a compilation track but due to massive interest now a full dingle release and then by a new release City Lights/ Dynamite Love (4:20). In the pipeline then there are a couple of his own mix compialtions, as well as a new single \"Cellar Door\", a job as a presenter on MTV Europe and a constantly growing dj schedule.\n\nAt the end of 2004 Loco Dice is signed to Josh Winks label Ovum Records. Following the success of \"Menina Brasileira\" on Ovum there's a new outing scheduled for the summer with them with \"Flight LB 7475/El Gayo Negro\". Before that there's a new single out on Cocoon called \"Cathargo/Sorted\" and one on the ueber cool imprint Rebel One. On the remix front Dice and studio partner Martin Buttrich have been very busy there's a remix of Layo & Buschwacka & Green Velvet's new piece \"Life to love\" out on Olmeto as well as their interpretation of Warren G feat.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

The two crossed paths on a flight to Mallorca back in 1999, when Dan was a resident DJ at Ministry of Sound and touring globally, and Igor was deep in the world of illegal underground raves whilst producing music under the name Tropic 39. By that stage the two had gone through a number of strong formative years surrounded by music.\n\nGrowing up, Dan was exposed to some of the most influential musicians of the time. His father was regarded as one of the greatest Saxophone players in the world, working with legends including Marvin Gaye, Phil Collins and Ray Charles. It was the perfect environment for the young boy to spark an ear for melody and grooves. Having worked with great success as a sound engineer in his teens and early 20s, Dan founded his own group \u2018Intense\u2019 alongside one of his oldest friends. The group, while playing at raves all over the UK and producing innovative new music remained confined to Britain, until they launched Logical Progression Level 3 at Brixton Academy. With a live recording of their new album, they became an underground hit and were signed to Sony Japan, taking them on tour globally.\n\nIgor, by the age of 16, after a visit back to Mallorca for a summer vacation where he first experienced nightlife, regularly went out at every opportunity he had. When he finished school and moved to University in London, all his money went to growing his record collection and he would spend hours mixing at his house instead of studying. Every moment he could spare would be spent in some of London\u2019s landmark clubs, such as The Cross, Ministry Of Sound and Club UK, which all played a huge part in Igor\u2019s progression into the world of electronic music. Although Igor also worked in a Rock music studio his passion was throwing raves in his homeland, Mallorca.\n\n1999 arrives and Dan hops on a flight to Mallorca to see his sick mother, and this is where he begins his first ever encounter with Igor, after some initial banter about the industry, they swap numbers, but never call one another. Coincidentally a mutual friend in Palma reintroduced them to one another in 2001, neither remembered meeting 2 years earlier on that plane journey. However, eventually the connection clicked and a few studio sessions later, they discovered their powerful synergy when working together and after some hedonistic visits to Ibiza, their true united passion for techno was discovered. The guys submitted their demo \u2018Oh Yeah\u2019 to Sven and his Cocoon label which was released just a few months later, leading to the creation of Pig&Dan\n\nSince then, Pig&Dan have achieved an amazing back catalog of releases on labels including Soma, Plus8, Terminal M, Bedrock and more recently Drumcode. Chart topping releases came in the form of \u2018Growler\u2019 and their landmark LP \u2018Modular Baptism\u2019 on their own cherished label ELEVATE.

He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Allan Chase Quartet w/ Phil Grenadier, Bruno Raberg, and Scott Amendola\n\nAllan Chase-saxophone\nPhil Grenadier-trumpet\nBruno Raberg-acoustic bass\nScott Amendola-drums\n\nThe Program: Music of Charlie Parker, creatively reimagined, in the first set, and original compositions by Allan Chase and Bruno R\u00e5berg in the second set."}, {"Address": "145 Lake Merced Blvd, Daly City, CA 94015", "Artist": "Soraia", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8104123.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.485946, 37.703642], "Date": "Sun Mar 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-15", "Genre": "Genres: Garage Rock, Rock n roll, Rock", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Rock N Roll Flea Market @ Pacelli Event Center", "moreBioInfo": "When an octopus loses one of its eight arms, it regrows the missing appendage in a matter of weeks. This mysterious capacity for creativity and rejuvenation under the sea symbolically presents itself again and again in the songs of Dead Reckoning, the take-no- prisoners debut Wicked Cool Records album by Soraia being released October 13. \u201cDead Reckoning is a nautical term meaning that you know where you are in the ocean based not on your location on a map but on where you've already been,\u201d says Soraia singer ZouZou Mansour. \u201cI may not know exactly where I'm headed, but these lyrics are all about who I am today \u2014 the good, bad and ugly.\u201d Tracing threads beginning with the \u201960s soul of Stax and Motown, borrowing flickers of luminescence from rock icons such as Patti Smith and Joan Jett as well as Iggy Pop and The Cramps, through kindred spirits of the \u201990s and beyond like PJ Harvey and The Kills, the primal sounds of this Philadelphia- based four-piece provide a formidable match for a set of mostly autobiographical songs that lead listeners through the depths of desperate situations and guide them out the other side to redemption. \u201cMusic had already saved me from several suicide attempts by the time I was 15, when the lyrics to songs spoke to me and revealed I wasn\u2019t alone in my suffering,\u201d ZouZou reveals. \u201cI knew by that age I was going to do music for a living. \u201cI lived a long time feeling a victim of things: life, people, situations. Powerless. I finally realized I needed connection. That\u2019s where empowerment comes in. My story is about bringing myself back to who I was always meant to be, which required commitment and action. It took action to change my life. And when I committed to and believed in that action, I asked for help where I needed it and continue to check myself and stay humble.\u201d After escaping some harrowing situations and getting sober, the pursuit of ZouZou\u2019s musical dreams began crystallizing in the band Soraia. \u201cSoraia is actually my birth name,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we want it to be how the band is known, because it\u2019s another name for the constellation Pleiades, and generally is taken to mean bright, guiding force or star. Our magic and energy emulate that idea, so it is no longer just the name but a group and the hope and purpose behind what we do. The idea is to give light.\u201d Surrounding ZouZou with boundless talent are bassist and frequent co-writer Travis Smith (\u201cresilient, passionate, with a gift for writing the catchiest riffs I\u2019ve heard from anyone, ever\u201d), guitarist and musical director Mike Reisman (\u201cplays like someone with three times his experience and keeps us centered\u201d) and drummer Brianna Sig (\u201cplays with reckless abandon and precision\u201d). \u201cWhat makes the sound of Soraia,\u201d says ZouZou, \u201cis we all are huge fans of the same legendary artists and bring these strong influences to the table: Travis\u2019 love of The Misfits and garage rock of the \u201960s versus my love of melody and pop, along with influences such as Queen and Led Zeppelin.\u201d The band made waves with their punked up cover of The Kinks\u2019 \u201c(I\u2019m Not) Like Everybody Else,\u201d which hit #1 on rock radio in South America in 2013. Their last independently released album In The Valley Of Love And Guns featured five songs the band co-wrote with Jon Bon Jovi. By this point, the energy emanating from the Soraia constellation had already reached the eyes and ears of renowned tastemaker Steven Van Zandt (The E Street Band, The Sopranos), the Wicked Cool mastermind who has eagerly bestowed Coolest Song In The World honors on five of their tracks since 2013, including his #1 pick of 2016, \u201cElectrocutioner.\u201d They\u2019ve consistently earned heavy rotation on Steven\u2019s weekly syndicated radio show and SiriusXM channel Little Steven\u2019s Underground Garage. Dead Reckoning\u2019s leadoff track \u201cQuicksand\u201d already enjoyed Coolest Song honors in mid-summer 2017. Longtime Rolling Stone editor David Fricke has also attested to his fandom, testifying, \u201cSearing guitars, burning soul and true CBGB grit: Soraia are the rock you need, in your face right now.\u201d The group made the trek up the New Jersey Turnpike in early 2017 to record Dead Reckoning at Van Zandt\u2019s Renegade Nation Studios in downtown New York City. Steven personally produced two of the tracks, one that he wrote for them (\u201cWhy\u201d) and the other an obscure Prince cover, \u201cWow.\u201d The band co- produced the rest of the record with the guidance of Geoff Sanoff [Fountains Of Wayne, Dashboard Confessional]. Finishing touches were provided by boldface studio names: mixes for the Steven-produced tracks by Bob Clearmountain [Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones] and mastering by Bob Ludwig [David Bowie, Neil Young]. As the next release in Wicked Cool Records\u2019 partnership with The Orchard as distributor, Dead Reckoning positions Soraia as an artist to watch. Their rising ambitions are reflected in new horizons they\u2019re setting out to conquer, such as their first European shows, slated for Spain and Germany this fall. \"Dead Reckoning\" - our 12-song album - releases on vinyl, cd, and digital this Friday, October 13th!

She is known for her virtuosic technique, energetic live performances and blend of musical genres such as jazz, progressive rock, classical and fusion in her compositions. She performs as a trio alongside bassist Tony Grey and drummer Martin Valihora. On October 19, 2006, the trio added guitarist David Fiuczynski (from the Screaming Headless Torsos), to form Hiromi's Sonicbloom. Hiromi's official website is located at http://www.hiromimusic.com.\n\nHiromi first mesmerized the jazz community with her 2003 Telarc debut, Another Mind. The buzz started by her first album spread all the way back to her native Japan, where Another Mind shipped gold (100,000 units) and received the Recording Industry Association of Japan's (RIAJ) Jazz Album of the Year Award. The keyboardist/composer's second release, Brain, won the Horizon Award at the 2004 Surround Music Awards, Swing Journal's New Star Award, Jazz Life's Gold Album, HMV Japan's Best Japanese Jazz Album, and the Japan Music Pen Club's Japanese Artist Award (the JMPC is a classical/jazz journalists club). Brain was also named Album of the Year in Swing Journal's 2005 Readers Poll. In 2006, Hiromi won Best Jazz Act at the Boston Music Awards and the Guinness Jazz Festival's Rising Star Award. She also claimed Jazzman of the Year, Pianist of the Year and Album of the Year in Swing Journal Japan's Readers Poll for her 2006 release, Spiral. Hiromi continues her winning streak as Hiromi's Sonicbloom with the 2007 release of Time Control and her 2008 release of Beyond Standard.\n\nBorn in Shizuoka, Japan, in 1979, Hiromi took her first piano lessons at age six. She learned from her earliest teacher to tap into the intuitive as well as the technical aspects of music.\n\n\"Her energy was always so high, and she was so emotional,\" Hiromi says of her first piano teacher. \"When she wanted me to play with a certain kind of dynamics, she wouldn't say it with technical terms. If the piece was something passionate, she would say, 'Play red.' Or if it was something mellow, she would say, 'Play blue.' I could really play from my heart that way, and not just from my ears.\"\n\nHiromi took that intuitive approach a step further when she enrolled in the Yamaha School of Music less then a year after her first piano lessons. By age 12, she was performing in public, sometimes with very high-profile orchestras. \"When I was 14, I went to Czechoslovakia and played with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra,\" she says. \"That was a great experience, to play with such a professional orchestra.\"\n\nFurther into her teens, her tastes expanded to include jazz as well as classical music. A chance meeting with Chick Corea when she was 17 led to a performance with the well-known jazz pianist the very next day.\n\n\"It was in Tokyo,\" Hiromi recalls. \"He was doing something at Yamaha, and I was visiting Tokyo at the time to take some lessons. I talked to some teachers and said that I really wanted to see him. I sat down with him, and he said 'Play something.' So I played something, and then he said, 'Can you improvise?' I told him I could, and we did some two-piano improvisations. Then he asked me if I was free the next day. I told him I was, and he said, 'Well, I have a concert tomorrow. Why don't you come?' So I went there, and he called my name at the end of the concert, and we did some improvisations together.\"\n\nAfter a couple years of writing advertising jingles for Nissan and a few other high-profile Japanese companies, Hiromi came to the United States in 1999 to study at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. For as open as her musical sensibilities had already been when she came to the U.S., the Berklee experience pushed her envelope even further.\n\n\"It expanded so much the way I see music,\" she says. \"Some people dig jazz, some people dig classical music, some people dig rock. Everyone is so concerned about who they like. They always say, 'This guy is the best,' 'No, this guy is the best.' But I think everyone is great. I really don't have barriers to any type of music. I could listen to everything from metal to classical music to anything else.\"\n\nAmong her mentors at Berklee was veteran jazz bassist Richard Evans, who teaches arranging and orchestration. Evans co-produced Another Mind, her Telarc debut, with longtime friend and collaborator Ahmad Jamal, who has also taken a personal interest in Hiromi's artistic development. \"She is nothing short of amazing,\" says Jamal. \"Her music, together with her overwhelming charm and spirit, causes her to soar to unimaginable musical heights.\"\n\nAt 26, Hiromi stands at the threshold of limitless possibility, constantly drawing inspiration from virtually everyone and everything around her. Her list of influences, like her music itself, is boundless. \"I love Johann Sebastian Bach, I love Oscar Peterson, I love Franz Liszt, I love Ahmad Jamal,\" she says. \"I also love people like Sly & The Family Stone, Dream Theater and King Crimson. Also, I'm so much inspired by sports players like Carl Lewis and Michael Jordan. Basically, I'm inspired by anyone who has big, big energy. They really come straight to my heart.\"\n\nBut she won't, as a matter of principle, put labels on her music. She'll continue to follow whatever moves her, and leave the definitions to others.\n\n\"I don't want to put a name on my music,\" she says. \"Other people can put a name on what I do. It's just the union of what I've been listening to and what I've been learning. It has some elements of classical music, it has some rock, it has some jazz, but I don't want to give it a name.\"", "otherInfo": "Hiromi No pianist alive imbues the solo piano format with more explosive virtuosity or thrilling unpredictability than Hiromi Uehara \u2013 a GRAMMY-winning artist the All Music Guide calls \u201cone of the most remarkable pianists of the past half century.\u201d A prodigious talent who debuted with the Czech Philharmonic at 14, the Hamamatsu, Japan native was mentored by Chick Corea and Ahmad Jamal early in her development, signing her first record deal with Telarc before graduating from Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music."}, {"Address": "998 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "The Bash Dogs", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9980455.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421431, 37.75704], "Date": "Sun Mar 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-15", "Genre": "Genres: Surf, Disco, Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Amado's", "moreBioInfo": "Raised on the 60s\u2019 colorful influences such as the The Doors, and the Maharishi-era, Beatles, The Bash Dogs have now landed on something fresh.

The trio quickly embedded themselves in the Orange County scene, playing local venues such as the Observatory, House of Blues, and the Wayfarer and building up an audience of bell-bottom wearing, record-collecting kids.\n\nWanting to give back to the community, in June of 2017, The Bash Dogs started Soul Kitchen, a monthly residency in Los Angeles and Orange County that embraces love and unity through a night of funky music and soulful dance. The event is inspired by the band\u2019s favorite LA watering hole, Good Times at Davey Wayne\u2019s, and helps the Barrett brothers bring a little 60s groove back home. As founders, hosts, and headlining band of Soul Kitchen, The Bash Dogs are ecstatic that Soul Kitchen has grown to be a regularly sold out success.\n\nIn anticipation of their first LP, The Bash Dogs are looking to expand on their wheelhouse sound and magnify the elements of disco-funk and dance music while staying true to the roots that got them here.

Three uniquely individualistic singer-songwriters combining their different voices and stories to craft an album with a message of individuality and self-acceptance in all moments of life. Each member of JEMS has had deep experiences owning their own truth and identity, despite environments or circumstances that could have silenced their authenticity. As a trio, their shared voice is that of strength and chooses to boldly illuminate vulnerability. Through songwriting sessions that sometimes look more like group therapy, the three are able to write on one another\u2019s life experiences and empathetically build a bridge to a broader message. The trio is inspired by the sounds of Laurel Canyon and the musical storytelling and authentic performances that defined that era. They hope to break open the time capsule and artistically balance musicality and lyrical intellect in a relatable and emotional way.\n\nJEMS debut LP was recorded at the historic Village Studios in studio D, with the trio singing their vocals together in the room Stevie Nicks designed. Engineered by Scott Smith (Jose Gonzales, Junip, Carole King, Grizzly Bear, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, The Revenant), Mixed by Jason Larocca (Black Mirror, Juliette Lewis), Mastered by Doug Van Sloun (First Aid Kit, Bright Eyes, She & Him, Jonathan Rice, Kings of Convenience, M. Ward, Sea Wolf), and Produced by longtime collaborator Cazz Brindis. They flushed out the band with the talents of Adam Tressler on Guitar (Angus & Julia Stone, Kacey Musgraves, Pet Shop Boys, Demi Lovato, The Mowgli\u2019s), Adam Popick on Bass (Matthew Perryman Jones, Madi Diaz), Adam Christgau on Drums (Ingrid Michaelson, Nicole Atkins, Lucius), Carey Frank on Organ (Tedeschi Trucks, Jane Monheit) and Paula Hochhalter, Emily\u2019s mom on Cello (Barbra Streisand, Michael Jackson, James Taylor).\n\nJEMS are anticipated to be as successful collectively as Emily, Jessica, and Sarah Margaret are individually. Between the three, the songstresses have shared accomplishments with some of today\u2019s choice artists like Portugal. The Man, She & Him, Carole King, Macklemore, Alicia Keys, Sam Smith, and Daft Punk, among others, and have hit milestones in their self-produced work- like the attention-grabbing release of Emily and Jessica\u2019s mashup \u201cStay/Animal,\u201d which earned them the #1 spot on Hype Machine and over 1 Million streams on Spotify and having many songs placed in and written for film and television.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1419 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Bohemian Knuckle Boogie", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433317, 37.782618], "Date": "Sun Mar 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Sheba Piano Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Bohemian Knuckleboogie at Sheba Piano Lounge: Don't let the hokey exterior fool you, this place offers a comfortable, even classy setting in the heart of the Fillmore.

His remarkable ability to sing about profound subjects in a simple way makes his songs a great place to lose yourself. Much of that comes from his upbringing.\n\nWilly grew up surrounded by rolling hills and horses in the small town of Oakdale, California. Known as the \u201cCowboy Capital of the World\u201d for breeding so many world champion rodeo cowboys, Oakdale is still Willy\u2019s home and the setting for many of his songs.\n\nDespite coming from a long line of cattlemen \u2013 his grandfather Walt was one of the most respected of his generation \u2013 Willy\u2019s first love was baseball. As a catcher, he had a gift for the nuances of calling a game from behind the plate. When a knee injury ended his ability to catch, Willy turned his attention to music.\n\nAt the age of 18, a discerning and intimate set by Greg Brown at the Strawberry Music Festival inspired Willy to pursue life as a folk singer. Strawberry would play an integral role in Willy\u2019s development as a musician, going from spectator to stagehand, to performer. He made his main stage debut with his band the Good Luck Thrift Store Outfit at the 2009 festival. In 2015, Willy made his solo debut on the main stage. Willy has charmed fans at some of the best festivals in the country.\n\nWilly calls John Hartford, Roscoe Holcomb, Bob Dylan, KISS, Weird Al Yankovic and Willie Nelson his biggest influences, but is always quick to advocate for his favorite contemporary songwriters which include Tom VandenAvond, Nathan Moore, and his Good Luck partner in crime, Chris Doud. He and VandenAvond have travelled the country together on a series of tours they call \u201cSearchin\u2019 for Guy Clark\u2019s Kitchen\u201d where each evening\u2019s show is just a precursor to an endless quest for the kind of serene late night scene depicted in the cult classic documentary Heartworn Highways.\n\nOn his new release Knuckleball Prime, Willy received support from greats like Benmont Tench (Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers), Greg Leisz (Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton), and Gabe Witcher and Noam Pikelny of the Punch Brothers. Of the album\u2019s title, Taylor says \u201cmost baseball players peak in their twenties, but knuckleball pitchers tend to blossom in their late thirties and early forties. I\u2019m staring down my knuckleball prime.\u201d\n\nLed by producer Michael Witcher, the songs on Knuckleball Prime are arranged and accompanied magnificently by a first rate team of musicians and engineers. If you\u2019re a fan of well-written lyrics, alluring melodies, and a voice that ties them together with emotion as deep as the artist\u2019s own roots, you\u2019ll savor Knuckleball Prime, and just about anything else Willy Tea Taylor has ever done.", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $34 Floor Standing // $44 Balcony Seated // $39 Floor Day of Show"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Robert Earl Keen", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9092744.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Sun Mar 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-15", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Americana", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "Singer, songwriter, and entertainer, Robert Earl Keen, has recorded 19 albums and performed thousands of shows.
