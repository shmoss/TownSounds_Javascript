His was the sort of upbringing where \u201cif you\u2019re going to do something and you\u2019re not going to do it one-hundred percent you shouldn\u2019t do it all.\u201d It\u2019s why the 25-year-old singer-songwriter treats each song he writes with a painstaking level of dedication, reverence, respect and, as he\u2019ll readily admit, even a bit of obsession. McCollum says that when a particular melody or lyric or emotion is tugging at him, hell, he might just stay in his room for days at a time working it out. He can\u2019t help himself.\n\nThat\u2019s because for the Austin-based singer and multi-instrumentalist the end result is worth the occasional pain in the process. \u201cThat\u2019s where I find my identity,\u201d McCollum, who broke out with the revealing and critically adored 2013 debut The Limestone Kid and now returns with his highly anticipated follow-up album, Probably Wrong, says of penning soul-baring, honest and forthright Americana anthems. \u201cIt just takes over,\u201d he says of the songwriting muse and, one senses, his ever-winding, sometimes gut-wrenching journey as an introspective musician.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this life. It chose me.\u201c\n\nSet for release on November 10 independently, Probably Wrong, pulls back the curtain and reveals McCollum like never before. The 10-track LP, written after the dissolution of a long-term relationship, is equal parts introspective, self-flagellating and transcendent. It\u2019s also the most honest McCollum has ever been in song. There\u2019s an inherent pain that bleeds through in the raw honesty of stunning songs including \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d and \u201cHell of a Year.\u201d For McCollum, putting his most intimate thoughts and feelings to song is more of a welcome relief than an act of bloodletting. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about my feelings very often,\u201d he notes. \u201cI keep a lot of things in most of the time and I don\u2019t want anybody else to have to deal with my shit. I just write songs instead.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of The Limestone Kid\u2019s release, and its lead single \u201cMeet Me in the Middle\u201d finding success at regional radio, McCollum says \u201cin the blink of an eye\u201d his life drastically changed.\u201d The then-22-year-old went from a life of smoking pot on his couch and passing his days strumming the guitar to traveling from one gig to the next not as a nobody but rather a revered traveling musician with a fervent fanbase. McCollum always wanted to be a singer-songwriter but he admits he was caught a bit off guard by the buzz around Limestone. \u201cI was playing catch up for two years,\u201d he says.\n\nIn speaking with McCollum, it\u2019s easy to detect the sense of wonderment and romance he still attaches to the brutally honest songwriters he first revered during his teenage years. Men like Townes Van Zandt, Todd Snider, Steve Earle and James McMurtry \u2014 even as a wide-eyed and innocent young man, McCollum sensed these musicians were speaking to a more powerful truth. \u201cIt would jerk my soul out of me,\u201d he says of encountering and quickly becoming enamored with their music and subsequently dedicating his life to molding songs of a similarly revealing bent. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I\u2019ve ever encountered that has had as much influence on me,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to listen to. It was my thing.\u201d\n\nTo that end, when he began writing the songs that would ultimately comprise Probably Wrong, McCollum felt it necessary to be alone with little more than his emotions and a guitar. \u201cI needed to write this record and be on my own,\u201d he says of what led him to end a two-year relationship and retreat inward. \u201cI felt very misunderstood throughout the entire situation,\u201d he adds. \u201cI broke my own heart for the first time just to write this record.\u201d For six weeks, McCollum did nothing but stare at a piece of paper filled with soul-crushing lyrics and engage with his sadness. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a sad person,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cBut I had done it to myself intentionally.\u201d\n\nThe pain still lingers, but McCollum says accessing it to write his new album allowed him to pen some of his most poignant material to date. \u201cHell of a Year,\u201d which he calls his \u201csleeper favorite of the record,\u201d came from McCollum breaking down one night in his truck in a fast-food parking lot. \u201cMy heart\u2019s out of love/I fell out of line/I swore I\u2019d never leave again/And I lied,\u201d he sings over a gentle acoustic guitar figure. \u201cWhen I set out to write this record this was the type of song I was gunning for,\u201d he says of \u201cHell of a Year.\u201d \u201cIt was the hardest song I\u2019ve ever written as far as being that honest. But after doing so I could go back to being happy for a little bit.\u201d On the slow rolling \u201cMisunderstood,\u201d the singer throws his hands in the air and makes peace with what he can\u2019t control. \u201cYou told me I was no good/It\u2019s alright babe/I\u2019m pretty used to being misunderstood.\u201d\n\nSinging such soul-baring songs is a decidedly therapeutic act for McCollum. \u201cWhen the melody is so spot-on and it hooks me everything that I have been bottling up or not talking about comes out.\u201d It\u2019s why the singer says he lives to perform. \u201cNext to the songwriting the live show is most important,\u201d he offers. Though, seeing as many of his gigs are rowdy, upbeat affairs, he says he searches for the right moments to pepper his set with more emotional numbers. \u201cI\u2019m constantly trying to find ways to make our live show better,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cAnd my confidence level keeps going up and up. Most of the time onstage I\u2019m running around like I\u2019m the man,\u201d he adds with a laugh, \u201cbut I\u2019m definitely not.\u201d\n\nThe goal going forward then, McCollum insists, is to never remain stagnant. He idolizes musicians like John Mayer whom he says are always redefining their creativity. He intends to do the same. \u201cMy goal is to totally evolve and reinvent myself with each record I make,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing with each record and really not giving a shit. And if you can pull that off, well, that\u2019s a pretty special thing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Snotty Nose Rez Kids ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10068195.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Tue Apr 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-14", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Rap, Indigenous Hip-hop, Hip Hop, Trap", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "Snotty Nose Rez Kids is a Haisla Hip-Hop duo from Kitimat, BC, composed of rappers Yung Trybez & Young D.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist.

All About Jazz marveled: \u201cVenezuelan Suite\u2026 is the perfect confluence of Venezuelan ideals, jazz language and chamber-esque sophistication. In short, it\u2019s a masterpiece.\u201d One of Simon\u2019s most recent collaborative projects is the trio Steel House, with the pianist joined by bassist Scott Colley and drummer Brian Blade for a group that blends acoustic jazz improvisation with electronic-tinged atmospherics for an inviting, song-oriented sound.

Couple that with all their music friends joining in on the fun, and this new CD makes a very strong case for Northern California being the new torch-bearing center of the classic Chicago and Texas blues sound.\nSix stellar originals tell the couple\u2019s individual and combined personal histories in an honest and cosmic way. Beth & RW\u2019s love of the classic blues vibe pays off and yet, these songs could easily be covered by well-known singers in many roots music idioms.\nNestled alongside are songs by their mid-20th century heroes Jimmy Reed (lead track, \u201cThere\u2019ll Be a Day\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t That Loving You Baby\u201d), Memphis Minnie (\u201cLookin\u2019 the World Over\u201d), Big Bill Broonzy (\u201cLonesome Road Blues\u201d), jump blues brother-sister act, Buddy & Ella Johnson (\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Stop It\u201d) and Memphis Slim (\u201cMother Earth.\u201d)\nRed\u2019s Blues has a finger-poppin\u2019 attitude\u2014straight outta the afore-mentioned golden years when blues, R&B and swing all meshed together and dance floors every night were filled with snake hips and slow drags. Beth, with her sensual, southern voice and classy behind-the-beat phrasing is more a Julie London or Bobbie Gentry-styled singer: smoky with languid, sexy sophistication. She can swing too, just check out the big fun on \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Ya Stop It.\u201d This rich nightclub feel is missed on too many modern singers. The yearning confidentiality, the wise heart that Beth brings to her true-life stories reveal tales of youth seen through grown up reflection.\nRW, who has not lost his hometown Rome, Georgia accent has this quality also. Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is back at the lovely Empress Lounge.

On That\u2019s What I Heard, Robert celebrates the music of Curtis Mayfield, Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland, The Sensational Nightingales and more, alongside four newly written songs. Listen to the first single \u201cAnything You Want\u201d here (by Robert Cray), available now on all streaming services.\n\nCray and Jordan go way back, having met during the making of the Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll, in 1987. They started working together in 1999, when Jordan produced the Grammy-winning Take Your Shoes Off, and the recent Grammy-nominated LP, Robert Cray & Hi Rhythm. That\u2019s What I Heard is their sixth album. \u201cOnce you start working with Steve, it\u2019s kind of hard to get away from him,\u201d said Robert.\n\nThe music on That\u2019s What I Heard falls into two camps, the sweet and the funky. Of the former, \u201cYou\u2019re the One\u201d comes from the Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland songbook. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing where I feel you kind of gotta get out of your own head when you're covering one of your heroes,\u201d Cray explained. \u201cBobby\u2019s one of those. You just let yourself go, and do the song because you love it.\u201d\n\nDon Gardner\u2019s \u201cMy Baby Likes to Boogaloo\u201d and the Billy Sha-Rae minor hit, \u201cDo It\u201d are acknowledged rarities (the originals can be heard on the compilation, Groove & Grind: Rare Soul). \u201cDo It\u201d is leaner and meaner, the sort of bare-bones funk that defined the Detroit club sound in the early \u201970s with Sha-Rae, Dennis Coffey, and Earl Van Dyke. Cray\u2019s steamroller rendition gets a little extra push from guest guitarist Ray Parker, Jr., who played in Sha-Rae\u2019s band as a teen.\n\n\u201cBurying Ground\u201d is a sacred song from the Sensational Nightingales, inspired by Cray\u2019s youth, when Sundays on the stereo were reserved for his parents\u2019 gospel records. Curtis Mayfield wrote \u201cYou\u2019ll Want Me Back\u201d for Major Lance, and Cray wrote \u201cTo Be with You\u201d for his late friend, Tony Joe White. \u201cHot\u201d is another Cray original. \u201cAs for the lyrics, \u201cWe always say to ourselves, \u2018I\u2019m old, but I\u2019m hot,\u2019\u201d he said, and laughed. Spotted hanging around the studio, Steve Perry sang harmony vocals on \u201cPromises You Can\u2019t Keep,\u201d written by Steve Jordan, Kim Wilson and Danny Kortchmar.\n\n\u201cRobert is just a great person besides being extraordinary talent,\u201d adds Jordan. \u201cPeople gravitate to his guitar playing first, but I think he\u2019s one of the best singers I\u2019ve heard in my life. Not only because of his singing ability, but his interpretations.

Their eighth full-length is a collection of ruthlessly melodic and irresistibly compelling progressive folk metal that will immediately resonate with any who have followed the band at any point over the two decades of their storied career. \"Being so close to the album, it's almost impossible for us in the band to have an objective opinion about it, but my impression is that it's a more diverse collection that's also more extreme in some ways. There are more instrumental passages than on 'Valkyrja' (2013), and there are a lot of guitar and bass details,\" states guitarist/vocalist Heri Joensen. \"I really feel we've realized the vision we set out to create all those years ago, and as I listen through the album, I am satisfied with every aspect: the epicness, the intricacy, the melodies and harmonies, and the sheer heaviness of it. I love the whole atmosphere of it.\"\n\nKnown for their prolific nature - dropping their first five full-lengths in the space of just seven years - the six-year gap between Valkyrja and Hel is by far the longest between any two of their records. During that period the band toured hard, taking the album around the world, including a support run with Children Of Bodom in North America and an appearance on the 70,000 Tons Of Metal cruise. However, other factors played into this extended break between releases. \"We approached this one differently because I learned that if I continue doing albums in the way we had up to now, I would die from a heart attack before I'm 50!\" says Joensen. \"That's one of the reasons we changed our method and took such a long time on this one.\" That this tactic - which also includes more songwriting contributions from bassist/vocalist Gunnar Thomsen and guitarist Terji Skiben\u00e6s than on previous releases - has been beneficial is borne out in the finished product, which is perhaps more immersive than those that came before. \"Musically it leans a bit towards our album, 'Ragnarok' (2005),\" states Thomsen. \"It's a bit more epic and also much better worked through than any of our previous albums.\" It also marks the recording debut of drummer Tadeusz Rieckmann, who has manned the drum throne for T\u00fdr's live shows since 2016. \"We had some problems finding the right guy some years back, but Tadeusz is the man for the job,\" says Joensen. \"He's a very technically able drummer, but at the same time, he has a very natural old-school heaviness to his style, and he plays with deep emotion, which is just what we need.\"\n\nConceptually, the album is informed by a combination of mythology, personal experience and observations of current international events, making for a multifaceted experience that can be processed and understood on many levels. Starting not with a specific story to tell but with an atmosphere in mind, Joensen prefers not to disclose too much detail when it comes to lyrics, keen for listeners to have a chance to take what they want from the songs, though he provides a basic description of that which inspired him. \"Hel is the realm of death in Norse mythology, the underworld where those who die a natural death, not in battle, go. A bit confusingly, it is also the name of the goddess who rules over the same realm. She's the daughter of Loki and a terrifying creature to look upon.\" Two of the songs - \"Ragnars Kv\u00e6\u00f5i\" and \"\u00c1lvur Kongur\" - are traditional Faroese ballads and are as such sung in Joensen's native tongue. Followers of T\u00fdr will be aware that they have on numerous occasions strayed from English, which Joensen acknowledges as the \"language of metal\", though this time out it is only the ballads that feature non-English lyrics. \"If I have a good folky melody, I always have the thought that I should write the lyrics in Faroese, but I seldom have the time. The traditional songs come with lyrics, so it's just about picking out the verses I want to use.\" These tracks were in actuality selected even before the release of Valkyrja and have had a long gestation period, Joensen feeling that in adapting them they very much fit with the band's signature sound. \"I am always trying out melodies and chose 'Ragnars Kv\u00e6\u00f0i' first for the fascinating melody in the chorus, and secondly for the storyline. The other ballad I picked first because of the lyrics, which refer to Odin extensively, and secondly for the melody and chorus. I was very satisfied with the harmonies and epic feel of the arrangements I'd come up with, and to tell you the truth, I wish there were more songs of this kind on the album.\"\n\nHel was tracked entirely by Thomsen and Joensen, with sessions split between the latter's studio in S\u00f8ldarfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur, drums lain down at Jacob Hansen's studio in Denmark, Skiben\u00e6s working in his home studio, and some solos and bass details recorded while they were on the road in North America. \"The sessions took us a long time because we did it all on our own. But we gathered a lot of knowhow while doing it, so it will be a good reference for the future,\" states Thomsen. Joensen concurs, adding, \"It was a bit more relaxing than usual, which was good for me. It took some discipline, and creative people are not typically the most disciplined types. I am definitely not, so I guess it could have gone faster with someone else at the whip!\" That the delay in getting the record out means it's emerging in the twentieth year of T\u00fdr's existence is quite poignant. It has definitely not been an easy road to this point, with several members having come and gone, and those that remain having had to endure some very difficult periods, but despite all of it, they have managed to make it through, and achieved a great deal in the process. \"I did dream about becoming an internationally successful professional when I started. It's what I aimed at, but still it's a bit surreal that we've made it this far,\" Joensen admits. \"I didn't in my wildest dreams think I could put survive such misery and abject poverty that this career has lead me through. Still, here I am.\" Thomsen \"could not be prouder\" when he looks back at the string of records they have released, also acknowledging the ups and downs experienced along the way, but making an important point: \"We've done something nobody from where we're from has done before,\" he states plainly. \"But there's a lot more to come!\"\n\nKeep up to date with T\u00ddR at the following locations:\nhttp://www.tyr.fo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tyrband\nhttps://twitter.com/tyrband\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tyr_official\nhttps://www.youtube.com/tyrband\n\n\nBand History:\nProfession of the Christian Faith or Decapitation: This was the choice given by Sigmundur to his Faroese Viking compatriot Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu. And so it was that in 999 A.D., the Christianization of the small \u201cFaeroe Islands\u201d began, casting a veil of oblivion over the ancient Scandinavian gods and only leaving the relics of forgotten heathenry buried deep within the Christian ritual. Or so it was believed...\n\nExactly 999 years later, a small group fondly remembering the archaic gods and rites came together to form the Faroese Viking metal band, T\u00ddR. The one-armed God of War \u2014the bravest of all\u2014 became the eponym of the Nordic quartet. Yet T\u00ddR mastermind Heri Joensen is no war monger in disguise and points out that T\u00ddR (also known as the God of Justice) is also revered for first seeking the avenues of diplomacy\u2014an attribute that does not take away from this god of war\u2019s drive.\n\nA distinctive trademark that sets T\u00ddR apart from most other bands of the Viking metal genre is the authenticity of their music: \u201cTraditional music dating back to the Vikings, that is not preserved anywhere else in the world, not even in Iceland, is passed on in an oral tradition here and it is still alive and well. That is what we build our music on and draw great inspiration from,\u201d explains Joensen.\n\nAlmost every song is based on Faroese or Norwegian lore, and is riveted in the garb of the folk metal genre. Its approach unmistakably creates very true Viking metal.\n\nFollowing the release of a demo, the \u00d3lavur Riddararos single, full-length How Far to Asgard, six years of innumerable gigs, and several domestic television appearances, T\u00ddR\u2019s second full-length Eric the Red became the Islands\u2019 best-selling album, coming to the attention of Napalm Records, the label that finally made the album available worldwide in 2006.\n\nImmediately, the unique approach of T\u00ddR\u00b4s music, melting traditional Nordic songs and dances with Celtic influences, doom, heavy, and progressive metal found fans around the globe. \u201cHail to The Hammer\u201d became the hymn to the new generation of folk, pagan, and Viking metal fans.\n\nIn late 2006, T\u00ddR refined their trademark sound with Ragnarok. Technically brilliant and 100 percent authentic, Ragnarok was nothing less than a masterpiece within the true Viking metal genre. The Faroese band embarked on a European tour with Die Apokalyptischen Reiter and a few months later with AMON AMARTH. Though musically different, T\u00ddR gained legions of new fans, impressed by the four men on stage, who were able to turn every show into a demonstration of musical prowess.\n\nFestival appearances throughout Europe and continued touring followed until T\u00ddR enjoyed their biggest live triumph ever at the very over-crowded Wet Stage in Wacken.\n\nLand was released in 2008 and proved to be yet another milestone in the band\u2019s career. Traditional Faroese lyrics marked tracks such as \u201cG\u00e1tu R\u00edma,\u201d \u201cF\u00edpan Fagra\u201d and \u201cLokka T\u00e1ttur,\u201d and \u201cGandkv\u00e6\u00f0i Tr\u00f3ndar,\u201d which is a poem by J.H.O. Djurhuus about the Faroese chieftain Tr\u00f3ndur, who fought against the dying of the old beliefs and for the independence of the Faeroes. A video clip was produced to the fan favorite \u201cSinklars V\u00edsa.\u201d Land received overwhelming positive feedback and a new audience was able to experience the power of T\u00ddR for the first time.\n\nFollowing the release of Land, T\u00ddR embarked on numerous tours through Europe. One of the highlights was without a doubt the Aaskereia Festival tour with then label-mates Alestorm and Hollenthon. Thanks to their efforts, the band reached many new fans with their memorable concerts. 2008 ended with T\u00ddR being nominated as \u201cBand of the Year\u201d by the Faroese National TV and radio. However, the band had no time to rest on its laurels and embarked on yet another tour through North America in the spring of 2009.\n\nDespite their busy touring schedule, T\u00ddR worked on new songs recorded in early 2009. The band chose to produce the album on native soil. Jacob Hansen mixed the new material with finishing touches provided by the mastering experts at Finnvox. By the Light of the Northern Star met with great feedback from fans and critics alike. The new anthem \u201cHold the Heathen Hammer High\u201c was regarded as the legitimate successor to \u201cHail to the Hammer.\u201d After the release of the album By the Light of the Northern Star, the band played numerous concerts and festivals, as well as taking part in the 70.000 Tons of Metal cruise, while still finding the time to work on new material for their upcoming release.\n\nThe story of King Thrym, who dared steal Thor\u00b4s hammer \"Mjollnir,\" may set the lyrical stage on T\u00ddR's latest album, but it does not prevent them from covering more current topics like in the track \"Shadow of the Swastika.\" The Lay of Thrym follows the path of the band's previous releases by uniting classic heavy metal riffs with impressive drumming, traditional melodies, and powerful choruses. The result is a number of epic anthems, such as \"Take Your T\u00ddRant\" and \"Hall of Freedom,\" both of which will most certainly earn a permanent spot on T\u00ddR's future set lists. Frontman Heri Joensen continues to give T\u00ddR a unique and unmistakable edge with magnificent vocals and superb guitar work. Jacob Hansen was again responsible for recording, mixing, and mastering the album, complementing this fascinating Faeroese sound universe with finishing touches that allow every last detail to shine. The Lay of Thrym is a genuine Viking metal album that will undoubtedly secure T\u00ddR's hold on this genre with its heroic melodies and glorious riffs.\n\nValkyrja, the 7 full-length album from the Faroe Islands natives T\u00ddR, is a concept album with a story line based loosely around an nameless Viking age warrior who leaves his woman and goes off to impress the Valkyrie on the battlefield so that she may bring him to Valhalla, or to F\u00f3lkvangr, the home of Freyja\u2014the goddess associated with love, sexuality, beauty, fertility, gold, sorcery, war, and death. One can say the album is also indirectly about women and how they affect men and what men will do to impress and obtain women. Frontman and founder Heri Joensen goes on to explain; \u201cthe woman that the warrior leaves may represent the earthly women. Freyja, The Lady Of The Slain, may represent the perfection of Women, and the Valkyrie is the link between the two, taking men from earthly to godly women.\u201d\n\nRecorded at Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark with Jacob Hansen who handled production, mixing and mastering, the band began writing guitars and drums for Valkyrja over a year ago with melody lines and arrangements being handled in the studio. \u201cI had the story outline and approximate titles very early in the writing process, but only very late, maybe almost too late, did I write the actual lyrics,\u201d comments Heri Joensen. The band\u2019s drummer, K\u00e1ri Streymoy, parted ways with T\u00ddR after the band completed their US run on Pagan Fest and before they entered the studio so T\u00ddR enlisted George Kollias who stepped in to handle recording duties on Valkyrja. In terms of what the band hopes fans take away from the album, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen states \u201cI hope they will enjoy it and they like the new direction as well as (guitarist) Terji's bigger involvement in writing and George's drumming. We had a more upbeat direction without changing T\u00ddR's style.\u201d\n\nDiscography:\n\u00d3lavur Riddararos (2002)\nHow Far to Asgard (2002)\nEric the Red (2003)\nEric the Red re-released (2006)\nRagnarok (2006)\nLand (2008)\nHow Far to Asgard re-released (2008)\nBy the Light of the Northern Star (2009)\nThe Lay of Thrym (2011)\nValkyrja (2013)\nHel (2019)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Honey Gold Jasmine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8182717.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Indie, Jazz, Hip Hop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Honey Gold Jasmine is a singer-songwriter, visual artist and ARTivist from Vallejo, CA known for her eclectic and innovative sound that combines experimental elements of hip-hop, R&B, and jazz.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to.

Recorded at the iconic Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama, Italian Ice finds the Nashville-based artist joined by Spooner Oldham and David Hood (both members of The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who played on classic records from the likes of Aretha Franklin and Etta James), Binky Griptite of The Dap Kings, Jim Sclavunos and Dave Sherman of The Bad Seeds, and drummer McKenzie Smith (St. Vincent, Midlake).

Pool had carved out a unique place for himself in the bass music community; performing under the moniker of SPL for over 10 years and releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and trap-oriented music on respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Sub Human, Rottunn, and SMOG Recordings. SPL\u2019s music was fully immersed in sound design, a musical landscape comprised of melodic, dark, and refined touches. By the Summer of 2014, Pool came to the realization that he had pushed the SPL project to its sonic boundaries and in order to evolve musically, he would need a new project to explore lighter textures and richer melodies. Rooted in jungle and bass music and built around elements of blippy 8-bit sounds, arpeggios, and lush 80s synths, Champagne Drip launched as a decidedly tropical and uplifting sounding project. Operating at first in anonymity, Champagne Drip made a big splash thru the release of official remixes of Bassnectar (Amorphous Music) and Elliphant (Mad Decent). Shortly thereafter, he released his debut EP \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d on Mad Decent in September of 2014. Over the first year of the project\u2019s history, press outlets were fascinated with the unique sound, but also with uncovering the identity of the secretive producer behind the music. \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d was subsequently remixed by electronic upstarts Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick and released in the Spring of 2015 as \u201cRemix Bikini\u201d. In the Fall of 2015, Champagne Drip released his 2nd EP for Mad Decent, \u201cJourney Into The Champagne Sea\u201d. Whereas his first EP explored more overtly tropical overtones, \u201cJourney\u201d went into deeper and darker musical territory. After spending one full year refining his sound in the studio, he finally revealed himself as the former SPL in 2016; performing across the US at such festivals as Mysteryland, WTFest?, Imagine, Enchanted Forest, and Lights All Night. Building up anticipation for his next original recordings, Champagne Drip released the stand alone single \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d, which was featured on the official Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign fundraising compilation \u201cRave4Bernie\u201d. Official remixes for Grandtheft (Mad Decent), Cardinox (Warner Brothers), and Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE (Mad Decent) followed. Champagne Drip capped off an already busy 2016 with the release of two new EPs; \u201cPoseidon\u201d via Quality Goods Records and \u201cOf Course I Still Love You\u201d via Saturate Records. Official remixes for Zeds Dead & Diplo, UZ, and DAWN all saw early 2017 releases. Champagne Drip is set to have his biggest year yet in 2017, with multiple EPs scheduled for release on Deadbeats Records as well as forthcoming remixes for 12th Planet and Mayhem, which are due for Summer releases. https://twitter.com/champagnedrip https://soundcloud.com/champagnedrip https://www.instagram.com/champagnedrip Bookings: champagnedripbookings@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Dilated Peoples ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8130142.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Hip-hop", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Directors Of Photography | New Album http://rse.lnk.to/DilatedDirectors | Management: Kevin Zinger - Info@Regimeinc.com | Tour Dates: http://rhymesayers.com/dilatedpeoples", "otherInfo": "The UC Theatre Presents: Little Brother & Dilated Peoples with Zion I"}, {"Address": "314 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Andy Moor ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9034530.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413904, 37.771448], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Progressive Electronic, Trance, Electronica, Ambient", "Time": "4:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Halcyon SF", "moreBioInfo": "DJ, Producer, Musician - UK", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Scott Pemberton Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8652402.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Psychedelic, Funk, Blues, Rock, Soul-jazz, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "4:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "Scott is an emerging force on the festival circuit, with his wild approach to the guitar and nimble funky band he is immediately recognizable and undeniably original.

Driven and inspired by the thriving music scene of his hometown which includes such greats as Professor Longhair, Doctor John and The Meters, Moore\u2019s name is now mentioned amongst these Big Easy mainstays.\n\nIn the early \u201890s, Moore helped found the New Orleans-based essential funk band Galactic. Their first album, 1996\u2019s widely acclaimed Coolin\u2019 Off, led to an intense tour schedule of nearly 200 gigs a year for the next ten years. Building on their fan base by adding an esteemed list of all-star collaborations to the six albums that followed, Galactic continues to amass a worldwide audience via recording and touring globally.\n\nMoore launched his solo career in 1998 aided by eight-string guitar virtuoso Charlie Hunter and saxophonist Skerik (Les Claypool, John Scofield, Roger Waters). The group recorded All Kooked Out! featuring a handful of local New Orleans musicians as well.\n\nIn the midst of these recording sessions yet another concept was taking shape. Outtakes turned into the first Garage a Trois release, Mysteryfunk (1999). In 2000 the trio, led by Moore behind the drum kit, was joined by percussionist Mike Dillon (Les Claypool, Ani DiFranco) and has since released three more albums \u2013 Emphasizer in 2003, Outre Mer in 2005 and Power Patriot in 2009.\n\nMoore extended his solo discography with the release of Flyin\u2019 the Koop (Verve/Blue Thumb) in 2001, and III (Telarc) in 2006. Following the latter Modern Drummer called Moore\u2019s trademark sound \u201cinfectious, jazz-meets-Bonham, nouveau second-line.\u201d Recorded at the legendary Preservation Hall in New Orleans, III featured organist Robert Walter (Greyboy Allstars, The Head Hunters) and guitarist Will Bernard (T.J. Kirk, Doctor Lonnie Smith) as the Stanton Moore Trio, with special guests Skerik and trombonist Mark Mullins (Galactic, Bonerama, Harry Connick, Jr., Better Than Ezra).\n\nIn 2008, Moore looked to continue his scaled back session crew with Walter and Bernard to record Emphasis! (on parenthesis). Says Moore, \u201cWhen it came time to do another record, I had already known for a while that I wanted to build on the momentum of this band \u2013 three musicians who were becoming a unit unto themselves \u2013 and I wanted to get a little more adventurous with the music itself.\u201d\n\nIn April 2010, Moore releases Groove Alchemy. The 12-track set is the culmination of Moore\u2019s multimedia project that also includes an instructional book and DVD of the same name. All three facets of the project are designed to explore the roots of funk drumming by examining the work of pioneers like Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Zigaboo Modeliste \u2013 each of whom made their mark at different times throughout the 1960s as the engines driving James Brown\u2019s and the Meters\u2019 legendary rhythm sections \u2013 and in turn tracing their influences back to the rhythms coming out of New Orleans in the earlier part of the 20th century. Recorded at Levon Helm\u2019s studio in Woodstock, NY, this project is the follow up to the widely acclaimed Take it to the Street DVD and book that focused specifically on New Orleans drumming styles.\n\nShowing his outstanding versatility, Moore has appeared on Heavy Metal Grammy nominees Corrosion of Conformity\u2019s In the Arms of God, Irma Thomas\u2019 After the Rain (winning a grammy in the process), Robert Walter\u2019s Super Heavy Organ, Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) and Boots Riley\u2019s (the Coup) Street Sweeper Social Club, Will BernarDiane Birch\u2019s Bible Belt, Alec Ounsworth\u2019s (Clap Your Hands Say Yeah) Mo Beauty. He continues to play dates globally with an ever-evolving cast of musicians including John Scofield; Karl Denson; George Porter, Jr., and Leo Nocentelli (of the Meters); Charlie Hunter; Warren Haynes; John Medeski and Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin and Wood); Donald Harrison Jr.; Dr. Lonnie Smith, Dr. John, Tab Benoit, Robert Walter; the New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to name a few.\n\nWith a bachelor\u2019s degree in music and business from Loyola University, Moore stays involved in education by constantly giving clinics and teaching master classes and private lessons all over the world. He has been a contributing writer for Drum!, Modern Drummer, and DownBeat magazines here he was featured on the covers of more than six drum publications. In 2005, he launched a signature line of cymbals with Bosphorus Cymbals and a signature drumstick with the Vic Firth stick company. In 2009, Moore developed his own drum company to introduce his signature titanium snare drum that he designed in conjunction with Ronn Dunnett.\n\nDeeply affected by Katrina and its aftermath, New Orleans\u2019 native son was quick to lend a hand by spearheaded the Tipitina\u2019s Music Workshop, free Sunday seminars that cater to children and a rotating cast of well-known professionals to promote the preservation of New Orleans music. He also set up the Staletta Fund, a scholarship started by he and his wife Aletta to help cover costs for aspiring students to attend jazz camps, auditions and further their education.\n\nMoore stays active as a spokesperson for the Gulf Restoration Network and is a regular proponent of and player with the Voice of the Wetlands All-Stars. Additionally he serves on the board of directors for the Roots of Music, a free music education and academic mentoring program founded by Derrick Tabb, drummer for Rebirth Brass Band and recent nominee for CNN\u2019s Heroes awards.\n\nGalactic\u2019s next record Ya-ka-may was released February 2010, and Moore steps into the role of producer on Anders Osborne\u2019s next record due out in April.", "otherInfo": "General Admission.

There might be the occasional double-time breaks and the heavy and deep typically viennese feeling.\n\nConsider K&D to roam in their own, unique realm of musical beutekunst that owes and gives a lot to rare funk tunes, electric jazz arrangements, the feeling of deep soul, hiphop, dub, reggae, ambient, fusion, brazil, chansons, dope beats and drum+bass and still a lot more influences that happen to find the interest of the two austrians.\n\nAt a time when hip hopbeats started to emancipate themselves from the rapping and everyone started to pay highest attention to the blooming breakbeat scene in the UK, K&D broke through out of nowhere with one 4-track e.p. (G-stoned) that featured a hypnotic track called High Noon and a cover that showed the dj-duo in true Simon & Garfunkel form, straight out of Richard Avedon anno 1969.\n\nThe impact was massive, especially since the first wave of enthusiasm came from the UK where musical imports from the continent are seldom appreciated. Gilles Peterson played the track at first on his famous now called Worldwide-show.\n\nGathering momentum with support from people like Wall of Sounds Mark Jones and tracks for fellow Austrians Count Basic or strange people like William Orbit, the further story of K&D and Richard's Tosca project is well documented on various compilations and twelve inch releases. They met people like the Ninja tune posse, touched base with the leftfield dance, befriended Munich's Compost crew, remixed artists as diverse as Bomb the bass, Bones thugs & harmony, Alex Reece, United Future Organisation, Rockers Hifi (the K&D version was used in the video of \"Going under\"), Lamb, Roni Size, Depeche Mode and dj-ed in more clubs than you would care to count.\n\nBe it their self-produced tracks or the sound of their remixes, the K&D symptomatic feeling of lush european loungcore-dub pervaded all swift changes of the triphop hype and survived as a highly personal expression that found easy access into the world of drum&bass when the breakbeats became soulful.\n\nTheir regular presence in the club circuit, a characteristic side effect of their consistant travelling as djs, made them well-received guest at the various crossing of an international beat-set that took them from Vienna to London, to the American Westcoast, to Germany and back, with a tightly packed dj-bag full of remixes tracing their steps.\n\nA mix-CD compilation, DJ-kicks, for german label studio K7 marked a relevant change in the overall concept of K&D or rather in the way the audience seemed to take them in. From being well-respected underground heroes they had emerged to be full fledged media-celebrities in the music-press whose mix-CD was so excellently mixed and selected, that many new fans were attracted all over the world.\n\nK&D are maybe something like the continental answer to the british breakbeat or the american illbient scene, but then again their musical imprint is outernational anyway. They could achieve the special abstract global reputation that makes them neighbours to RockersHifi, Fila Brazilia, Howie B., DJ Shadow, the wordsound collective, Coldcut or the Thievery corporation in a virtual neighbourhood of twekwando-ing beatmeisters.\n\nBut, with a number of prolific dj-dates of K&D all around the world and the production and releases of Tosca and Peace Orchestra as well as numerous remixes, it seems unavoidable that there will be a lot of talk about Peter Kruder & Richard Dorfmeister.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "144 Taylor St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "The Freshmakers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9032581.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.41066, 37.783936], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "R&b, Rock, Hip Hop, Country, Pop", "Time": "5:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "PianoFight", "moreBioInfo": "The Bay Areas newest top 40 band, rocking a range of hits from hip hop, pop, rock, and country.
