As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings.

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit. Keep your eyes open for the debut of his new group the \"Megadonz\" in late 2007.\n\nFor more info on MEGADONZ check out their MySpace page at:\nwww.myspace.com/megadonzmusic", "otherInfo": "Open Mic with Brendan Getzell at Hotel Utah: The Old West and indie music come together at the Hotel Utah Saloon, where a small stage, an antique bar, and a diversely stocked jukebox set the scene.

Those years were among the most tumultuous our country has ever seen and the duality between the generally positive state of affairs within our band while watching so many things we care about being decimated and destroyed all around us informed the writing of this album to the core.\n\nWhile a quick glance might imply that we\u2019re picking up where 2016\u2019s American Band album left off, the differences are as telling as the similarities. If the last one was a warning shot hinting at a coming storm, this one was written in the wreckage and aftermath. I\u2019ve always said that all of our records are political but I\u2019ve also said that \u2018politics IS personal\u2019. With that in mind, this album is especially personal.\n\nOur 2018 single \u201cThe Perilous Night\u201d acted as a sort of coda to the polemic of the last album and the original plan was to zigzag in a different direction, but alas the past few years have seen an uptick in school shootings, church shootings, racial violence, suicides and overdoses, border violence, and an assault on so many things that we all hold dear. They\u2019re literally putting children in cages. Writing silly love songs just seemed the height of privilege.\n\nMy partner Mike Cooley and I both worked through deep pools of writer\u2019s block. How do you put these day to day things we\u2019re all living through into the form of a song that we (much less anybody else) would ever want to listen to? How do you write about the daily absurdities when you can\u2019t even wrap your head around them in the first place? I think our response was to focus at the core emotional level. More heart and less cerebral perhaps.\n\nEventually the songs did come, some in mysterious ways. A day-long layover at an exit outside of Gillette, Wyoming resulted in \u201c21st Century USA\u201d, the song that for me opened up the floodgates, enabling me to write my portion of the album.\n\nI wrote \u201cBabies in Cages\u201d in the living room of my wife\u2019s parent\u2019s house and quickly demoed it on my phone. A portion of that original recording acts as the introduction to the version on the album. Cooley wrote \u201cGrievance Merchants\u201d about the proliferation of white supremacist violence we\u2019ve seen in recent years. Our family\u2019s babysitter\u2019s best friend was murdered on a train in beautiful progressive Portland, Oregon in one such incident. The political is indeed very personal.\n\n\u201cArmageddon\u2019s Back in Town\u201d takes a whirlwind joyride through the daily whiplash of events we are collectively dealing with, while \u201cSlow Ride Argument\u201d offers an unorthodox but hopefully effective method of the prevailing of cooler heads. Perhaps it should come with a disclaimer though.\n\nMeanwhile \u201cAwaiting Resurrection\u201d dives headfirst into the void of despair and painful realities these times are tolling. It\u2019s a song unlike any in our band\u2019s history, yet somehow quintessentially DBT to the core. A call to deal, unblinkingly, with the horrors surrounding us all, but to also survive, with perhaps even a hint of optimism.\n\n\u201cIn the end we\u2019re just standing, watching greatness fade into darkness /\nAwaiting Resurrection\u201d\n\nIf the writing was a long and brutal process, the recording was a joyous celebration. Another of our band\u2019s many dualities, perhaps.\n\nWe convened for a week in Memphis, Tennessee at the historic and wonderful Sam Phillips Recording Service. We tracked, mostly live in the studio, aided by long-time producer David Barbe and famed engineer Matt Ross-Spang. Initially recording 18 songs in 85 hours of near around the clock sessions, the band essentially spent the whole week in an artistic marathon, housing ourselves at the Memphis Music Mansion (AirBnB), surrounded by historic photos and a mid-century vibe that seemed to even seep into our dreams each night. (My bedroom was, fittingly, The Big Star Room, named after the seminal Memphis power pop band that I have always held as an all-time favorite).\n\nRecording in Memphis has been a life-long dream for this band. Both the city, with its dark social history and amazing musical heritage, and the studio which is a time machine set to its early 1960\u2019s origins and inhabited by the spirit of its genus founder, affected and inspired the creation of this album in ways that go far beyond the tangible and technical.\n\nSam Phillips left my hometown of Florence, Alabama and moved to Memphis, working in radio before opening the legendary Sun Studios (Memphis Recording Service) where he essentially discovered Rock and Roll, recording the first records of Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Ike Turner, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Rich, and of course Elvis Presley. When he sold Sun, he built his dream lair, the, then state of the art Sam Phillips Recording Service which opened in 1962. If Phillips\u2019 love of \u2018slap-back\u2019 echo had given those early Sun records their legendary sound, his new studio incorporated three different echo chambers into its design, giving the studio a very unique and wonderful sound that we incorporated into this album.\n\nI can\u2019t impart enough the impact that recording there had on this album. We were all beyond inspired by the surroundings and the sounds coming out of the speakers from every playback or the sound of the echo chambers reverberating down the halls. Every day we got to hang out with Sam\u2019s son Jerry who took us up to Mr. Phillips\u2019 old office on the third floor. Unlocked in time, it was still exactly as it had been the last day Sam spent there. His jackets still hanging in the closet and the bar still stocked with his favorite whiskey. There, with Jerry, we toasted our recordings and the spirits that still inhabited that sacred space.\n\nIn honor of finally getting to record in Memphis, I wrote \u201cRosemary with a Bible and a Gun\u201d, a sort of stream of conscious love song to that dark and mythical city on the banks of the Mississippi. Although the song isn\u2019t a literal story of such, it was certainly informed by the brutal times Cooley and I had in 1991 when we followed Sam Phillips\u2019 example and moved from Florence to Memphis in search of dreams that for us were still to be over a decade in coming. I heard the song in my head as a sort of Bobbie Gentry inspired southern gothic and we further explored that by adding gorgeous strings by Kyleen and Patti King (arranged by Kyleen). It seemed the perfect way to kick off this album.\n\nOur sessions were rounded out by a guest appearance from Cody Dickinson (North Mississippi All Stars) who came in and played an electric washboard through an Echoplex and wah-pedal into an amp for \u201cBabies in Cages\u201d. The song, recorded completely live, in one magical take, perfectly captured the mood and tone of the week we spent there. (We even kept the scratch vocal since it had so much live bleed from the take). The following day, Mick Jagger came by, but alas we weren\u2019t able to record with him, although his presence certainly added to the already surreal vibe of the week.\n\nA few months later we reconvened in Athens, Georgia at Barbe\u2019s Chase Park Transduction studios where Matt and David mixed the album on Barbe\u2019s vintage 1975 Neve console. As a band that got its start essentially making albums as field recordings on mobile gear, it is indeed a treat to get to make our albums on 2\u201d 16 tracks tape in historic studios and on beautiful vintage gear. We finished the process by having the legendary Greg Calbi master it all at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey.\n\nIn the end, we whittled the album down to the nine songs included, saving several key songs for a foundation to the next one that will hopefully occur sooner than later. Lilla Hood designed the packaging utilizing a stunning photo by Erik Golts of two young lads watching a sunset at the Oregon coast, lettering by famed graphic artist Aaron Draplin, and once again beautiful artwork from our long time collaborator Wes Freed. We plan on touring extensively throughout the next year taking these songs around the world.\n\nWe hope to see you there.\n\n- Patterson Hood\n\n\nWe are beyond thrilled to announce the release date of our new album American Band.\nWe are launching a PRE ORDER and our friends at NPR are posting a first taste so you can get a little sample of what we've been up to.\n\n\"Surrender Under Protest\" is a Mike Cooley composition that is unlike any DBT song we've ever recorded, yet somehow sounds unmistakably like us. In a way, that's pretty indicative of the album as a whole.\n\nThese are crazy times and we have made a record steeped in this moment of history that we're all trying to live through. We've always considered ourselves a political band, even when that aspect seemed to be concealed by some type of narrative device i.e. Dealing with issues of race by telling a story set in the time of George Wallace or class struggles by setting \"Putting People of the Moon\" in the age of Reagan.\n\nThis time out, there are no such diversions as these songs are mostly set front and center in the current political arena with songs dealing with our racial and cultural divisions, gun violence, mass shootings and political assholery. Once again, there is a nearly even split between the songs of Cooley and myself, with both of us bringing in songs that seem to almost imply a conversation between us about our current place in time.\n\nAmerican Band is a sort of rock and roll call to arms as well as a musical reset button for our band and the country we live in. Most of all, we look at it as the beginnings of some conversations that we, as a people very much need to begin having if we ever hope to break through the divisions that are threatening to tear us apart.\n\nDrive-By Truckers are celebrating our twentieth anniversary as a band in an election year where some people are trying to define what it is to be American. Definitions based on some outdated ideology of prejudice and fear. We are loudly proclaiming that those people don't speak for us. America is and always has been a land of immigrants and ideals. Ideals that we have often fallen short of achieving, but it's the striving that has given us whatever claims to greatness we have had. That's what America means to us and \"We're an American Band'.\n\nAmerican Band - the eleventh studio album by Drive-By Truckers\nComing September 30th, 2016 from ATO Records.\n\nAnd don't miss the Darkened Flags 2016 Tour, beginning in August .\n\nSee you at The Rock Show,\nPatterson Hood\nDBT", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30PM // Show 8:30PM // Ages 21+ // $36.50 Advance & $38.00 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "3248 22nd St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "The Pleasure Palace", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6258940.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419552, 37.755527], "Date": "Tue Mar 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Revolution Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Pleasure Palace at Revolution Cafe: The walls of this breezy Mission District cafe display a continuously changing exhibition of local visual art, and Papa Toby's diverse music calendar follows suit.

Consistent-that is-in that he\u2019s rarely consistent in what we\u2019ve come to expect from him. Constantly making unique inroads with many different styles of music, he has followed his particular muse in any way it leads him for almost three decades.\n\nAlthough heavy metal and progressive rock has always been his primary focus, each year that passes recently has resulted in new peripheral works that have seen him branch off to everything from country, new age, ambient noise or even orchestral musical theatre. As endearing as that has been to his constantly growing fanbase, it has also made it difficult to classify with much accuracy what he does and what he represents. Who is Devin Townsend? What is his musical identity? With his new album, \u2018EMPATH\u2019, we find that Devin Townsend is actually all of these things.\n\nOver the past few years, the success that Devin has slowly worked for has fortunately come with the power to control his own creative destiny. The recent successes with the DVD from a sold-out Royal Albert hall, or his 2012 \u2018Retinal Circus\u2019, or last year\u2019s \u2018Ocean Machine\u2019 live DVD with the Orchestra and Choir of State Opera Plovdiv has put him in a position where with the new album \u2018EMPATH\u2019, he will once and for all define himself as a musical force outside of any particular genre classification.\n\nThere has been a strangely conservative trend within the heavy music scene with the industry needing to define artists as one particular thing. Often that relegates musicians to boxes that are very limited. If you play heavy music, what genre of heavy music are you to be categorized under? If you play anything with a pop aesthetic, are you selling out? If you make beautiful chill sounds, and then promptly follow it with savage metal sounds, you are either viewed as doing it to be provocative, or that it\u2019s coming from an unfocussed vision. So what does one do if a single category does not contain the breadth of the expression that needs to come forth? If you have a history of heavy music -yet have skills that extend into different realms- getting any attention from those outside genres is next to impossible. You are automatically relegated to the metal world and that world alone. To be fair: EDM, Jazz, Classical, ultimately any genre\u2026the music world in general requires artists to \u2018stay in their lane\u2019 due to a need for categorization or simply the out of necessity due to the glut of albums released every month.\n\nSo what happens if you\u2019re an artist that simply uses \u2018genre\u2019 as colours in a wide palette? What happens if you\u2019re an artist like Devin Townsend with a history of musical knowledge and experience that extends far past the genre that made him famous? Furthermore: What if you think that Heavy Music is not something to be ashamed of, and you feel it deserves to fit into the typical fold of \u2018respected\u2019 music? It has been well known to those proficient in heavy music that it can represent emotions in ways that no other music can, and can add a dynamic to emotional music that makes the topics truly heavy. Devin has always had this ethos, and his fanbase has quietly followed him through a myriad of styles over the years where he has applied this.\n\nIf the desire (and the ability) to play different styles is not done to be provocative, but rather to illustrate a full spectrum of musical emotions, why would one not want to follow that?\n\nEnter \u2018EMPATH\u2019. Devin has decided to see what would happen if all the styles that make up his current interests were finally represented in one place. To finally shake the fear of expectation, and just do what it is he was meant to do creatively, \u2018EMPATH\u2019, true to the name, is about allowing the audience a feeling for a variety of musical emotions. The musical dynamics represented on this single album are broad, challenging, and immense. To approach this sort of work with a long history of what makes heavy music \u2018heavy\u2019, allows this to be done with a type of power rarely heard.\n\nThe theme of the work was based in participating with all of what makes life so simultaneously beautiful and challenging, and to not neither fear those things, nor let them define us. As much as this may sound like a confusing output, care was put into the trajectory of the album so that hopefully each section is \u2018welcomed\u2019 by the listener when it arrives. A roller coaster of emotion that makes each consecutive section that much more effective. Having a constant thread throughout makes it a thrilling and constantly interesting sonic experience. One that is very much rooted in the hope that through this work, it can be something that may inspire other musicians to do the same. This is not meant to be a \u2018glory project\u2019 rather; it is meant to be a celebration of the dynamics of what makes music interesting with great talent involved.\n\nIn what started as a clear vision several years ago, Devin realized that time was running out on the inspiration that had propelled \u2019The Devin Townsend Project\u2019. Although that band (and the series of records that bore its name) had seen his career surge in many fantastic ways, he knew that in order to proceed forward with his creative development, the band was limiting his ability to actualize what was becoming obvious he needed to pursue. When DTP disbanded at the end of 2017, there was concern that the decision was impulsive, rather than what it truly was: a strategic way to eliminate the parameters that being in a traditional rock band imposed on him.\n\nThe \u2018EMPATH\u2019 project and the massive amount of artists involved, was based in a need for total, uncompromising actualization of what he had been trying to achieve for much of his career. However, the ambition behind it required a strategy, so Devin began assembling a team of like-minded individuals to help him actualize this task in the most efficient ways possible. To create a completely over the top artistic statement that ultimately makes sense, yet also rings of hope in uncertain times, was a workload not to be taken lightly.\n\nIn an unexpected meeting with Frank Zappa Alumni and all around brilliant musical mind Mike Keneally, Devin began bouncing plans off of him as a friend until it became clear that Mikes mind was suited to help Devin organize the logistics of the project.\n\nIt began with the drummers, Devin had been writing ideas ranging from extreme metal, to prog, country, new age, orchestral and free jazz. All of which required the absolute best people for the job to not come off as a gimmick. Not content to find one drummer who would be pushed beyond his wheelhouse, Devin set out to find drummers that he could relegate certain songs and sections to from the large canon of music written during the \u2018EMPATH\u2019 period, and then track them in the best way possible. He chose Morgan \u00c5gren (Mats And Morgan, Frank Zappa, Fredrik Thordendal) for the improvisational, quiet and jazz portions of the album. Anup Sastry (Monuments, Periphery) for the prog metal pieces, and Samus Paulicelli (Decrepit Birth, Abigail Williams) for the full metal sections. Repeating the process that had resulted in pleasing drum sounds on his last album Transcendence, Devin enlisted Adam \u2018Nolly\u2019 Getgood to engineer the three drummers in order to achieve consistent results for what would undoubtedly end up being a monumental mixing task. The whole process was then taken to the famous Monnow Valley Studios in Wales, where Devin was joined by an army of talent. A host of engineers, technicians, the three drummers, an additional bassist by way of internet phenomenon Nathan Navarro as well as co-producer Mike Keneally. The studio was then set up as a residence studio, so the group lived in this fascinating UK location where artists such as Queen, Oasis, Black Sabbath (among many others) had recorded to great success. From there, the arduous task of making sense of music that would ultimately go between the lightest and the darkest sounds they could imagine would begin.\n\nThrough the entire process, either intentionally or by happenstance, Devin found himself in contact with many brilliant and unpredictable collaborators and people willing to help and inspire. Among the list of people involved were Elliot Desagnes, Steve Vai, Chad Kroeger, Anneke Van Giersbergen, Ch\u00e9 Aimee Dorval, Ryan Dhale, the fabulous Elektra Women\u2019s Choir as well as several renowned orchestras from around the world. The process became increasingly more fantastic and eclectic the more it all began to grow and take shape.\n\nFor the conclusion of the process, for vibe, a cabin in the woods was rented and all the recording gear was then moved in. A host of interesting artists would come by out of either morbid curiosity or simple interest and end up participating in the record. Devin\u2019s focus during this process was firmly rooted in his desire to not only- once and for all- make the statement he had been trying to \u2018get right\u2019 in the past, but also do it with a sense of joy and intention that was rooted in helping people and staying emotionally centred throughout. In a time of history where empathy is viewed as a weakness, the idea was to create songs of wildly varying styles to represent the need to view life from ALL its angles. To participate in these many musical emotions was about breaking away from the fears that he felt had held him in one place for so long creatively.\n\nTo make an analogy with the album that in order to understand others in this increasingly divisive time, we need to be willing to see things from other emotional points of view, was very important to this process.\n\nThe final stages of the album were when the true colours of it all began to appear. After spending a lot of time (and resources) to try and mix this massive statement with several different engineers, Devin realized that this project was not like others, and could not simply be mixed in one way. Typically, mixing nowadays relies on several techniques that, as cool as they sound, simply limit the dynamics of the material. At one moment it\u2019s a metal record, then it\u2019s a prog record, then it\u2019s a jazz record, then it\u2019s a pop record\u2026to mix and master that takes many mix styles with great attention to detail and obsessive tweaking. Devin ended up mixing it himself and the result is an truly accurate representation of what the project was meant to achieve, with a depth to the sonics that only a great deal of care can produce.\n\nIn the past, Devin has been told that it is simply \u2018not possible\u2019 to do all these different styles of music in one place, yet with a newfound success and significant support from the industry, he was determined to prove that not only can it be done, but in a musical climate where taking chances is typically seen as \u2018unwise\u2019, it could be done with supreme confidence and absolute lack of compromise.\n\nDevin Townsend / HevyDevy Records, InsideOut Music and Northern Music bring you \u2018EMPATH\u2019: A bold statement with massive production values and dynamic, uncompromised musicality. This is a statement about not only pursuing creative freedom in a conservative scene, but also trying to show that heavy music is truly a valid musical tool.", "otherInfo": "It is with immense disappointment that I have been put in the position to announce the postponement of the remaining dates on my Empath Vol. 1 North American Tour due to Corona Virus.\n\nWith the travel ban In effect from Europe and the consequent chaos that has brought to travel plans, as well as the increasing social unrest, combined with the fact that half of this crew is either European or from the UK, it put us in a tenuous position.

However, he discovered his true love when he picked up the guitar at age 11. After falling deeply in love with the guitar Chris began writing music as well. Not soon after Chris began taking formal guitar lessons he picked up \u201cThe Beatles Greatest Hits For Guitar\u201d and taught himself to play every song in the book. Over the last 15 years Chris has developed his song craft by playing in different bands, home recording himself and diving deep into the songwriting skills of artists like Ani DiFranco, Paul Simon and Keller Williams.\nIn early 2007 Chris left the band Moon Shine Blue to pursue a solo music career in the Orlando Area. He started by playing every \u2018open mike\u2019 that he could find. Armed with his acoustic guitar and a digital delay pedal he began widening his repertoire and developed his live looping technique. \u201cI\u2019m nowhere near guys like Keller Williams but I do enough to sound full in a loud bar setting.\u201d Mixing originals with a few carefully selected covers, Chris began to build a loyal following and started opening up for bands like The Fling and K-G and the Band in downtown Orlando.\n\nChris met Jason Gloria and Alex Eastman of Diatonic Productions soon after he started in Orlando. They hit it off and began recording what they thought would be a simple 6 song EP of acoustic guitar and vocal. What they ended up with was \u201cCB RADIO\u201d, a six song \u201cmini concept album\u201d. On this CD Chris plays acoustic and electric guitar, banjo, mouth flugel (made popular by Keller Williams) and performs the vocals with support from Alex Eastman on bass and Erik de la Cruz on percussion (both from The Fling). \u201cCB RADIO\u201d sounds like a full band project at points while keeping the intimate feel of a solo acoustic singer/songwriter.\n\nIn the next several months Chris intends to build on his initial success by following the release of \u201cCB RADIO\u201d with some live recordings and a full-length album already in the works that will include a video of the title track. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just focusing on playing in and around Orlando to get better known.

Well, \u201cshe\u201d equals \u201cthey,\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d a band masterminded by grunge-punk sage Tarah Carpenter, a firebrand frontwoman who channels explosive emotionality into rousing anthems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sensitive to things that happen around me, and I love studying psychology and human behavior,\u201d Tarah shares. \u201cWhen I write, I seek to process personal stories and news stories through these perspectives, but in a way that\u2019s relatable to everyone.\u201d\n\nTarah exudes a spiritual centeredness that is poetically aligned to the origins of her name. The name \u201cTara\u201d in Buddhist lore refers to the \u201cmother of liberation,\u201d an apt archetypal reference for such a strong and shamanistic female artist.\n\nTarah Who? recalls 1990s alt-rock and grunge\u2019s tradition of balancing integrity with tuneful songcraft. Entries in the Tarah Who? oeuvre sit nicely alongside Alanis Morissette, Foo fighters, The Distillers, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Spinerette.\n\nTarah Who? is a power trio in every sense of the phrase, bonded together by telepathic musical interplay and profound interpersonal connections. In addition to Tarah, the three-piece band also features bassist/backing vocalist Joey Southern, and drummer/backing vocalist Coralie Herv\u00e9. Previously, Tarah Who? has released two full-lengths, two EPs, and one single of raw punky rock n\u2019 roll. The band\u2019s output has garnered plaudits and earned feature-story coverage from GIG Radar, Kill The Music, La Grosse Radio, Loud Stuff, Moshville, Music Connection, Muzak, and The Ring Master, among other outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable feat for an unsigned band to make such waves in the biz, but Tarah Who?\u2019s incendiary live shows and snarling sing-alongs are hard to ignore. Even alt-pop goddess Alanis Morissette\u2019s guitarist Jason Orme has given a big stamp approval to the group, co-producing and playing guitar alongside Tarah on the recently released EP, Half Middle Child Syndrome. Jason will also be onboard for the band\u2019s upcoming EP.\n\nWith a stable lineup, and a dynamic rhythm section that can effortlessly shift from scorched-earth rock to tender balladry, the band is embarking on a halcyon era ushered in by its current EP, Half Middle Child Syndrome. The EP\u2019s name is a cheeky reference to how outsiders sometimes try to make sense of Tarah\u2019s interior landscape.\n\nThe fiery EP brims with tunefully tormented songcraft. A live favorite on the EP,\u201c Ache,\u201d is built around an ultra-catchy bashed-out punk riff that recalls Nirvana\u2019s irresistible rage. Beneath the maelstrom of the music is a vulnerable admission of pain over manipulated miscommunication accusations. \"Garden of Chlo\u00e9(s)\u201d showcases Tarah\u2019s gift for melding soulfully melodic vocals with bold and raw lyrics. Here, she grapples with the suicides of two friends named Chlo\u00e9. Other EP highlights include the vitriolic punk of \u201cPay to Play,\u201d and the sweetly seething mid-tempo alt-rocker \u201cLittle Pieces.\u201d\n\nTarah was born in France and began smashing away at the drums at just 14, ignoring those around her who suggested she try her hand at a more \u201cladylike\u201d musical pursuit. Willful, and somewhat stubborn, she honed her chops, forged her own creative path, and branched out to bass, guitar, singing, songwriting, and producing (she produced the band\u2019s EP alongside Jason).\n\nAfter a fateful move to Los Angeles, Tarah made her solo debut as Tarah Who? at a warehouse party. It was a gig she found on Craigslist, and it proved to be the perfect opportunity to share the songs she had been writing privately. After the gig was well-received, Tarah decided to form a band to enhance and support her songs.\n\nUp next, the trio is roaring to get back into the studio with Jason. The band is fired up, inspired, and tighter as friends and musicians. In closing, bassist Joey offers this final thought: \u201cWhen I first met Tarah, it floored me how bold she is; I felt this exuberance and fire from her. It reminded me of why I play music in the first place.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "144 Taylor St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Jota Mercury", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9202543.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.41066, 37.783936], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "Fresno, California", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "PianoFight", "moreBioInfo": "Jota (pronounced HO-TAH) Mercury is an international award winning drag king who works to constantly challenge the ideologies of machismo and male dominance.

His chordal language is amongst the more advanced for a guitarist, touching on ideas from George Van Eps and Ben Monder. He attended the Berklee School of Music for two and a half years before leaving in his sophomore year to tour with Gary Burton, the dean of the school at the time. Subsequently, he moved to Brooklyn where he continued to develop as one of the leading jazz guitarists of his generation by performing with the Human Feel, Paul Motian's Electric Bebop Band, Joe Henderson Group, and the Brian Blade Fellowship. In 1995 he won the Composer's Award from the National Endowment for the Arts and was eventually signed by Verve Records. Since then he has played and recorded as both a leader and sideman with fellow-alumni such as Mark Turner and Brad Mehldau as well as many others. His latest album, Deep Song (2005), features Mehldau and Joshua Redman. Some of his earlier albums include The Enemies of Energy, The Next Step and a more experimental Heartcore.\n\nOriginally from Philadelphia, Kurt Rosenwinkel currently resides with his wife in Switzerland.", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Kurt Rosenwinkel \"Caipi\""}, {"Address": "311 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "KnightressM1", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10233584.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.276005, 37.797178], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "Metal, Hard Rock, Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Elbo Room Jack London", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Bay Area rock royals SHAKE WELL team up with violin-fronted hard rock power trio KnightressM1 for a night of music sure to inspire your personal revolution."}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Strawberry Girls", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8365907.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "Progressive Rock, Rock, Aggressive Groove", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Strawberry Girls is a 3-piece progressive instrumental rock band from Salinas, CA.

Perhaps his near-manic recording and touring schedule was prologue that has led to the relatable sensitivity that is this album.\n\n\u201cThis record feels like a new direction,\u201d Putnam says.\n\nRecording at home on the fly, and skipping his usual demo and pre-production process, has allowed Putnam to maintain a spontaneous feeling that informs these songs, and obviously kept him from overthinking lyrics or anything else that stood in the way of a group of tunes that could be called \u201craw\u201d if Putnam wasn\u2019t so good at producing himself and if the word \u201craw\u201d didn\u2019t scream \u201cunder produced.\u201d\n\nThat is to say: these songs sound great.\n\nPutnam claims that the work on Anticipation Pops represent a thematic \u201cconsistent inconsistency,\u201d different from his more planned past albums. And while he dials that back when he agrees that the album is cohesive, he\u2019s either being modest, or is far enough outside of his comfort zone now not to notice that Anticipation Pops is actually his most thematic record of all.\n\nWriting ten personal songs from a unique perspective, but relatable to everyone, is an artistic goal most songwriters never achieve. True to Putnam\u2019s attitude of throwing caution to the wind with this album, the first single is the record\u2019s aptly titled opening cut, \u201cI Don\u2019t Care,\u201d a two-minute gem that leaves \u2018em wanting more.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something really special about a two-minute pop song,\u201d Putnam says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a shot of adrenaline. A song like that is a flash \u2013 it comes and goes \u2013 and is unexpected. \u2018I Don\u2019t Care\u2019 really sets the tone. It\u2019s a slow build of liberation and confidence, expressed in just two minutes.\u201d\n\nDoubling down on the attitude of \u201cI Don\u2019t Care,\u201d Putnam affirms once again that he made Anticipation Pops by deciding, \u201cthis is what I\u2019m doing, take it or leave it.\u201d Apparently he didn\u2019t know that the result would be the work his fans can care for most of all.\n\nAnticipation Pops, the fourth full-length album by The March Divide is out August 24th, 2018, on the artist\u2019s recently co-founded Slow Start Records label, preceded by the single, \u201cI Don\u2019t Care\u201d.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3248 22nd St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "29TH STREET SWINGTET", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419552, 37.755527], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Revolution Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "29th Street Swingtet at Revolution Cafe: The walls of this breezy Mission District cafe display a continuously changing exhibition of local visual art, and Papa Toby's diverse music calendar follows suit.

Artists across the board have discovered Jacobs\u2019 musicianship and supple versatility, resulting in an impressive variety of formats in which he has played over the last few years. After a decade, five records, and 200 shows a year as principal songwriter and frontman for beloved Baltimore-based band The Bridge from 2001-2011, Jacobs wasted no time continuing to write music of his own and exploring different configurations for his craft. He released his debut solo album, Songs for Cats and Dogs, in 2012, and continued to perform relentlessly, both with his new band and as a solo artist. In doing so, he quickly garnered the admiration of a variety of predecessors and peers: rock legend Steve Winwood saw Jacobs perform in 2014 and soon invited him to open his national tour. The following year, Sturgill Simpson extended the same invitation. Never limited by genre, Jacobs and New Orleans heavyweight Ivan Neville recorded a collaborative album under the band name \u201cNeville Jacobs\u201d, which will be released in 2017. As an adapting, evolving, versatile musician who has survived on his own merit, Jacobs continues to win over audiences of many tastes, as he brings his characteristic authenticity and soul to every set.\n\nJacobs feels there are common threads across many genres of music, and he has harnessed over a decade of trans-genre exploration on his second solo album, Dust to Gold, released in 2016, from American Showplace Music. The album is a soul-stirring expression of the current chapter of his creative evolution, featuring twelve well-crafted songs that masterfully weave through the sweet and rugged landscape of soul, country, folk, blues, gospel, and rock and roll. Through every turn, one can easily feel Jacobs\u2019 reverence to his influences, but the result is an original, eclectic record with a sound that is authentically his. In a given moment, Jacobs\u2019 guitar playing is gritty, soulful, rich, and lyrical. It\u2019s subtle, yet adventurous. His voice is at once sweet and sultry, with a honeyed whiskey croon that delivers his thoughtful, expressive lyrics.\n\nI know that the well I seek is bound to be the deepest of all been ever told I know that to plant a seed is alchemy, we can watch the dust turn into gold\n\nSo sings the hypnotic refrain in \u201cTurn Into Gold\u201d, a meditative slide-guitar rocker where Jacobs sings about channeling the muse, or \u201ctapping the source\u201d, as he calls it. It\u2019s about the desire to be \u201cenraptured in the mystery, the unknown, the questions, the answers all at once,\u201d Jacobs describes. This is the place in which his songwriting occurs, and from where Jacobs\u2019 performances derive so much electricity. In discussing the song\u2019s inspiration, Jacobs reflects, \u201cif I\u2019m playing or singing and I\u2019m really connected to that source and I\u2019m really locked in and there\u2019s a room full of people experiencing that, the hope is then for them to get locked into their own thing, and it\u2019s this beautiful, ecstatic magic that happens. To me, this is that elusive goal that I chase every time I sit down to write a song or every time I get on stage to perform.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Dust to Gold paint Jacobs\u2019 desire to express the beauty and struggle of the human condition. In \u201cCold Carolina\u201d, Jacobs pleads softly and emotively about a despondent relationship, the feeling of displacement, and the seeking of redemption, of salvation. In \u201cLittle Dreamer\u201d, Jacobs, accompanied by his wife, Kat Jacobs, sings sweetly to their unborn child, whom he discovered was on the way only moments before leaving to start recording the album. \u201cIt\u2019s a blink of an eye, this life / tiny grains in sands of time / so tie your purposes on wings and fly to the heavens with the grace and courage of a thousand kings\u201d, he sings to the tiny, nascent being.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cThe Devil or Jesse James\u201d, is a rousing mixture of New Orleans rhythm, blues, and rock and roll with ethereal tendrils of psychedelic guitar reaching out across the soundscape; painting a tale of a man trying to change identities and run away from one\u2019s past. On the album, the full band includes a richly funky rhythm section, featuring Todd\n\nHerrington on bass, Dusty Ray Simmons on drums, as well as John Ginty on Hammond organ and keyboards, who has been a master side man for years, working with Robert Randolph and the Family Band, Jewel, Citizen Cope; and most currently tours with the Dixie Chicks.\n\nThough \u201cDust to Gold\u201d clearly showcases Jacobs\u2019 well-worn songwriting chops, he is an improviser at heart, and he brings the spirit of seeking and living in the moment to the stage each time. In every performance, he tries to push the envelope, exploring the depth of each song anew. Whether live or on the album, Jacobs\u2019 dynamic voice and guitar envelope the listener completely and instantly, transporting you into the rich, sultry folds of his soulful sound.\n\nCris Jacobs continues to nurture a devoted audience that knows that whatever the instrumentation or setting he plays, it will be richly authentic, and conveyed with an improviser\u2019s curious spirit and palpable presence. We can only expect further evolution from Jacobs, an artist constantly inspired by the search for \u201cthose beautiful, sad, inspiring, heartbreaking magical corners of life. The most rewarding, and terrifying part of trying to be an artist is the journey itself, the vulnerability and riskiness in seeking them out trying to express them. Sometimes you hit dead ends, and sometimes you strike pure gold.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Cris Jacobs Band w/ King Dream"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Gladie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9905463.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Indie, Indie Pop, Indie Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "Safe Sins, the debut record from Philadelphia band Gladie, begins with a prayer: \u201cI close my eyes, pretend to pray/That this shame would just fuck off today,\u201d sings Augusta Koch, her familiar timbre floating atop a wave of bleary-eyed synths on opener \u201cPray.\u201d It\u2019s a gentle, hymnal introduction to a record that ducks from jangly power pop to plucky indie rock, scrappy electronic psych jams to swaying shoegaze. The record borrows its title from Koch\u2019s poetry zines: Safe Sins is a place of safety, acceptance, and progress. It is a record about isolation, loss, and dismantling shame and grief through self-analysis.\n\nKoch, formerly of beloved Philly trio Cayetana, has been working on the 10 songs that comprise Safe Sins for years. They existed first as poems before being brought to life at The Bunk in Henryville, Pennsylvania, where Koch (guitar, vocals) recorded with bandmates Matt Schimelfenig (guitar, bass, keyboard, vocals), Ian Farmer (bass), and Pat Conaboy (drums). Schimelfenig also produced and mixed the record.\n\nKoch explains that while Safe Sins tracks a narrative arc, it\u2019s not exactly linear\u2014it\u2019s complex and tangled, treading a more realistic path to healing. \u201cTo me, it has this vibe of the stages that you go through when you\u2019re grieving, but also how most people don\u2019t go through one stage then onto the next one,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have it over and over. Even in one day, you could experience all of those things and come up with some type of closure, then the next day feel differently. There\u2019s not really ever a clean conclusion.\u201d\nThe record\u2019s opener gives way to a rush of guitars and both digital and analog drums on the spritely \u201cWhen You Leave The Sun,\u201d a strut in crisp morning sunlight: \u201cOn the bright days, I can see the light/When the chemicals blend just right,\u201d Koch calls brightly. It\u2019s followed by lead single \u201cA Pace Far Different,\u201d a guitar-forward bop haunted by chiming keys and pleas for escape. Scattered throughout, between wiry guitar melodies, drum triggers, and cavernous synth patches, are small, insistent mantras: \u201cWe give \u2018em credit, we don\u2019t owe \u2018em that much,\u201d on \u201cEven At Your Easel,\u201d or the soothing nihilism of \u201cCosmic Joke,\u201d as Koch declares, \u201cEverything I lost, I never really had.\u201dThe record builds to a close with \u201cParlor\u201d and \u201cChoose,\u201d the first of which opens with light organ and drums, and finds Koch inventorying then stitching up the damage done by putting herself behind others: \u201cI\u2019ll gift myself my own respect/Maybe someday time will intercept, and I\u2019ll be able to grant my own success/To be happy.\u201d It\u2019s followed by the clean-slate of \u201cChoose,\u201d which reframes power and self-determination over a slow-march of guitars. \u201cNow I live in absence of or inside my least desirable traits/I pick and choose,\u201d Koch sings before resolving, \u201cI could wield this magic for good/Make it right, I know I could/If I choose.\u201d\n\nSafe Sins is defined equally by pain and hope, two opposing forces that define human existence. The record acknowledges that on some days, the former wins; on the good ones, the latter does. But neither are static endpoints. Both are places we visit often. Gladie are set uponmaking sure the path between them stays open, as Koch shouts firmly on \u201cTwenty Twenty:\u201d \u201cI am angry, I am lonely, but I am optimistic, too!\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1030 Main St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Peter Harper", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8574549.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Blues, Pop, Soul, Folk, Country, Americana, R&b", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Napa", "moreBioInfo": "I believe in being as honest and truthful as humanly possible at all times.

His grandparents played a variety of instruments; his mother played piano; and his father taught music and was a choir director. In addition to possessing a natural ability to sing, Aweau\u2019s early years consisted of piano, guitar, and \u2018ukulele lessons, followed by saxophone, percussion, and bass.\n\nHe began his professional career in college, accompanying such well-known performers as Gabe Baltazar, Henry Kapono, Loyal Garner, and Nohelani Cypriano, followed by stints as a member of the award-winning groups Ka`eo (1984-1988), The Ali\u2019i\u2019s (1989-1994), and Hapa (2003-2010). He was also the musical director for the legendary Don Ho for 16 years, and has worked with national artists such as Jerry Brown (drummer for Lionel Richie and Stanley Clarke), and Ron Lee (drummer for Barry Manilow).\n\nAweau also taught music at high school and college seminars, covering subjects ranging from writing, arranging, and sequencing to computer music. In one project he gave Hawai\u2019i high school students the chance to experience the process of producing and recording a song.\n\nIn addition to being a stage musician, Aweau has played for a variety of commercials and provided background music for a number of shows on the Travel Channel. A seasoned music producer, he has worked extensively in the studio producing, arranging, and performing for various large projects, commercials, radio stations, and other artists.\n\nBeloved by fans, Aweau is a natural storyteller with a somewhat self-deprecating sense of humor. His audiences love his explanations of the inspiration behind his songs. He is also highly respected by fellow musicians. The late John Koko, long-time member of the highly popular, multiple-award winning Hawaiian music group The Makaha Sons, once said, \u201cNathan Aweau ... Incredible Bass Player \u2026 Irresistible Voice... Incomparable Entertainer! The CD \u2018Kane`ohe\u2019 will take you on a musical journey that is Haunting...Refreshing... Powerful and Exciting.\u201d\n\nThe respect of other professionals in the music industry is also evidenced by the fact that Aweau has received numerous nominations and awards for his work, both as a solo artist and as part of a group. His 2001 release E Apo Mai received multiple N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards (Hawaii\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae), including Male Vocalist of the Year and Hawaiian Album of the Year. He also received Song of the Year honors at the Hawai\u2019i Music Awards for the album\u2019s title track.\n\n2005 saw Aweau again honored with multiple awards, as both a solo artist and as part of the group Hapa. His passion for the electric bass was expressed in his Bass Etude CD, which was voted Jazz Album of the Year. And Hapa\u2019s Maui CD, which shot up Billboard\u2019s World Music chart (peaking at number 7), received awards for Album of the Year, Contemporary Album of the Year, Graphics, and Engineering. Aweau was also honored with his second award for Male Vocalist of the Year for his album The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series - Vintage.\n\nIn 2006 Aweau received his third Male Vocalist of the Year award, for his The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series \u2013 Hula CD. In the 39 year history of the N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards, he remains the only artist to receive the honor three times.\n\nIn 2008 Aweau released \u201cKane\u2019ohe\u201d - the long-awaited follow up to \u201cE Apo Mai\u201d \u2013 which was comprised of songs that celebrate the place that he calls home. He wrote all twelve songs, played every instrument, sang all the background parts, and engineered, mixed, and mastered the entire CD.\n\nHis December 2015 release \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is yet another all-original album, filled with songs inspired by his beloved Hawai\u2019i, his first grandchild, Queen Lili\u2019uokalani, and more. As was the case for his other solo releases, \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is 100% Aweau.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1840 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Justus Proffit", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8996276.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.452592, 37.769515], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Whatever", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Milk Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Upcoming Shows", "otherInfo": "Massachusetts slowcore trio Horse Jumper of Love and Portland jangle poppers Strange Ranger return to San Francisco on March 25th!"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Jeff Peterson", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Masters of Hawaiian Music: George Kahumoku Jr., Nathan Aweau, & Jeff Peterson"}, {"Address": "3049 20th St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Bluegrass", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.411406, 37.758862], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Bluegrass, Country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Atlas Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Bluegrass & Old-Time Music Jam Session at Atlas Cafe: What's not to love about Atlas Cafe?

Those years were among the most tumultuous our country has ever seen and the duality between the generally positive state of affairs within our band while watching so many things we care about being decimated and destroyed all around us informed the writing of this album to the core.\n\nWhile a quick glance might imply that we\u2019re picking up where 2016\u2019s American Band album left off, the differences are as telling as the similarities. If the last one was a warning shot hinting at a coming storm, this one was written in the wreckage and aftermath. I\u2019ve always said that all of our records are political but I\u2019ve also said that \u2018politics IS personal\u2019. With that in mind, this album is especially personal.\n\nOur 2018 single \u201cThe Perilous Night\u201d acted as a sort of coda to the polemic of the last album and the original plan was to zigzag in a different direction, but alas the past few years have seen an uptick in school shootings, church shootings, racial violence, suicides and overdoses, border violence, and an assault on so many things that we all hold dear. They\u2019re literally putting children in cages. Writing silly love songs just seemed the height of privilege.\n\nMy partner Mike Cooley and I both worked through deep pools of writer\u2019s block. How do you put these day to day things we\u2019re all living through into the form of a song that we (much less anybody else) would ever want to listen to? How do you write about the daily absurdities when you can\u2019t even wrap your head around them in the first place? I think our response was to focus at the core emotional level. More heart and less cerebral perhaps.\n\nEventually the songs did come, some in mysterious ways. A day-long layover at an exit outside of Gillette, Wyoming resulted in \u201c21st Century USA\u201d, the song that for me opened up the floodgates, enabling me to write my portion of the album.\n\nI wrote \u201cBabies in Cages\u201d in the living room of my wife\u2019s parent\u2019s house and quickly demoed it on my phone. A portion of that original recording acts as the introduction to the version on the album. Cooley wrote \u201cGrievance Merchants\u201d about the proliferation of white supremacist violence we\u2019ve seen in recent years. Our family\u2019s babysitter\u2019s best friend was murdered on a train in beautiful progressive Portland, Oregon in one such incident. The political is indeed very personal.\n\n\u201cArmageddon\u2019s Back in Town\u201d takes a whirlwind joyride through the daily whiplash of events we are collectively dealing with, while \u201cSlow Ride Argument\u201d offers an unorthodox but hopefully effective method of the prevailing of cooler heads. Perhaps it should come with a disclaimer though.\n\nMeanwhile \u201cAwaiting Resurrection\u201d dives headfirst into the void of despair and painful realities these times are tolling. It\u2019s a song unlike any in our band\u2019s history, yet somehow quintessentially DBT to the core. A call to deal, unblinkingly, with the horrors surrounding us all, but to also survive, with perhaps even a hint of optimism.\n\n\u201cIn the end we\u2019re just standing, watching greatness fade into darkness /\nAwaiting Resurrection\u201d\n\nIf the writing was a long and brutal process, the recording was a joyous celebration. Another of our band\u2019s many dualities, perhaps.\n\nWe convened for a week in Memphis, Tennessee at the historic and wonderful Sam Phillips Recording Service. We tracked, mostly live in the studio, aided by long-time producer David Barbe and famed engineer Matt Ross-Spang. Initially recording 18 songs in 85 hours of near around the clock sessions, the band essentially spent the whole week in an artistic marathon, housing ourselves at the Memphis Music Mansion (AirBnB), surrounded by historic photos and a mid-century vibe that seemed to even seep into our dreams each night. (My bedroom was, fittingly, The Big Star Room, named after the seminal Memphis power pop band that I have always held as an all-time favorite).\n\nRecording in Memphis has been a life-long dream for this band. Both the city, with its dark social history and amazing musical heritage, and the studio which is a time machine set to its early 1960\u2019s origins and inhabited by the spirit of its genus founder, affected and inspired the creation of this album in ways that go far beyond the tangible and technical.\n\nSam Phillips left my hometown of Florence, Alabama and moved to Memphis, working in radio before opening the legendary Sun Studios (Memphis Recording Service) where he essentially discovered Rock and Roll, recording the first records of Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Ike Turner, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Rich, and of course Elvis Presley. When he sold Sun, he built his dream lair, the, then state of the art Sam Phillips Recording Service which opened in 1962. If Phillips\u2019 love of \u2018slap-back\u2019 echo had given those early Sun records their legendary sound, his new studio incorporated three different echo chambers into its design, giving the studio a very unique and wonderful sound that we incorporated into this album.\n\nI can\u2019t impart enough the impact that recording there had on this album. We were all beyond inspired by the surroundings and the sounds coming out of the speakers from every playback or the sound of the echo chambers reverberating down the halls. Every day we got to hang out with Sam\u2019s son Jerry who took us up to Mr. Phillips\u2019 old office on the third floor. Unlocked in time, it was still exactly as it had been the last day Sam spent there. His jackets still hanging in the closet and the bar still stocked with his favorite whiskey. There, with Jerry, we toasted our recordings and the spirits that still inhabited that sacred space.\n\nIn honor of finally getting to record in Memphis, I wrote \u201cRosemary with a Bible and a Gun\u201d, a sort of stream of conscious love song to that dark and mythical city on the banks of the Mississippi. Although the song isn\u2019t a literal story of such, it was certainly informed by the brutal times Cooley and I had in 1991 when we followed Sam Phillips\u2019 example and moved from Florence to Memphis in search of dreams that for us were still to be over a decade in coming. I heard the song in my head as a sort of Bobbie Gentry inspired southern gothic and we further explored that by adding gorgeous strings by Kyleen and Patti King (arranged by Kyleen). It seemed the perfect way to kick off this album.\n\nOur sessions were rounded out by a guest appearance from Cody Dickinson (North Mississippi All Stars) who came in and played an electric washboard through an Echoplex and wah-pedal into an amp for \u201cBabies in Cages\u201d. The song, recorded completely live, in one magical take, perfectly captured the mood and tone of the week we spent there. (We even kept the scratch vocal since it had so much live bleed from the take). The following day, Mick Jagger came by, but alas we weren\u2019t able to record with him, although his presence certainly added to the already surreal vibe of the week.\n\nA few months later we reconvened in Athens, Georgia at Barbe\u2019s Chase Park Transduction studios where Matt and David mixed the album on Barbe\u2019s vintage 1975 Neve console. As a band that got its start essentially making albums as field recordings on mobile gear, it is indeed a treat to get to make our albums on 2\u201d 16 tracks tape in historic studios and on beautiful vintage gear. We finished the process by having the legendary Greg Calbi master it all at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey.\n\nIn the end, we whittled the album down to the nine songs included, saving several key songs for a foundation to the next one that will hopefully occur sooner than later. Lilla Hood designed the packaging utilizing a stunning photo by Erik Golts of two young lads watching a sunset at the Oregon coast, lettering by famed graphic artist Aaron Draplin, and once again beautiful artwork from our long time collaborator Wes Freed. We plan on touring extensively throughout the next year taking these songs around the world.\n\nWe hope to see you there.\n\n- Patterson Hood\n\n\nWe are beyond thrilled to announce the release date of our new album American Band.\nWe are launching a PRE ORDER and our friends at NPR are posting a first taste so you can get a little sample of what we've been up to.\n\n\"Surrender Under Protest\" is a Mike Cooley composition that is unlike any DBT song we've ever recorded, yet somehow sounds unmistakably like us. In a way, that's pretty indicative of the album as a whole.\n\nThese are crazy times and we have made a record steeped in this moment of history that we're all trying to live through. We've always considered ourselves a political band, even when that aspect seemed to be concealed by some type of narrative device i.e. Dealing with issues of race by telling a story set in the time of George Wallace or class struggles by setting \"Putting People of the Moon\" in the age of Reagan.\n\nThis time out, there are no such diversions as these songs are mostly set front and center in the current political arena with songs dealing with our racial and cultural divisions, gun violence, mass shootings and political assholery. Once again, there is a nearly even split between the songs of Cooley and myself, with both of us bringing in songs that seem to almost imply a conversation between us about our current place in time.\n\nAmerican Band is a sort of rock and roll call to arms as well as a musical reset button for our band and the country we live in. Most of all, we look at it as the beginnings of some conversations that we, as a people very much need to begin having if we ever hope to break through the divisions that are threatening to tear us apart.\n\nDrive-By Truckers are celebrating our twentieth anniversary as a band in an election year where some people are trying to define what it is to be American. Definitions based on some outdated ideology of prejudice and fear. We are loudly proclaiming that those people don't speak for us. America is and always has been a land of immigrants and ideals. Ideals that we have often fallen short of achieving, but it's the striving that has given us whatever claims to greatness we have had. That's what America means to us and \"We're an American Band'.\n\nAmerican Band - the eleventh studio album by Drive-By Truckers\nComing September 30th, 2016 from ATO Records.\n\nAnd don't miss the Darkened Flags 2016 Tour, beginning in August .\n\nSee you at The Rock Show,\nPatterson Hood\nDBT", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Thurs.

His parents bought him his first guitar when he was 11 years old which quickly became his third arm. Marc has had a guitar in his hands ever since.\n\n\nAt age 13, his father saw such rapid progress that he sent him to the conservatory where he would study classical music. By then his mentors were Andres Segovia and John Williams.\n\n\nAt 17 he'd already won many prizes and started showing an interest in a variety of music genres including jazz, rock, Afro, pop, and more. At the same time he was playing in local bands in Britany (France).\n\n\nTragedy struck in the summer of 1981 when his debut career got cut short by a devastating accident to his left hand. The surgeon told him that his chances of playing guitar again were very slim and next to nothing. However, through the adversity, his love and passion for music helped him overcome this tragedy and in 1984 he was back on the scene in Paris, performing in clubs and recording for artists like Philippe Petit, Charlelie Couture, Jill Kaplan, France Gall, and Ray Lema.\n\n\nIn 1988 he moved to London where he joined Basia's band and worked with The Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra, Soul to Soul, Pato Banton, and General Public. He was also part of the London Acid Jazz scene. His world tour travelling lead him to spend time in Tokyo where he became an acclaimed session player.\n\n\nAs a true citizen of the world, Marc kept moving, this time to Los Angeles in the late 90's. He stayed there for 12 years playing for music royalty such as Sting, Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Cher, Selena, Queen Latifah, George Benson, Guru Jazzmatazz, Take 6 and others. He composed and performed for major movie soundtracks: \"Get Shorty\"; \"The Fan\"; \"Patch Adams\"; \"Midnight In The Garden Of Good and Evil\"; \"Demolition Man\"; and \"Celtic Pride\". He also worked with producers of the likes of Tommy LiPuma, Philippe Saisse, Marcus Miller, Mike Pela, Guy Roche and Stoker.\n\n\nMost importantly, however, Marc began his successful solo career. His first album was \"Classical Soul\" NYC records 1994. Then came \"Urban Gypsy\" NYC 1995, \"Madrid\" GRP 1998, \"Universal Language\" GRP 2000, \"Cruisin'\" GRP 2001, \"The Very Best of Marc Antoine\" GRP 2002, \"Mediterraneo\" Rendezvous Entertainment 2003 and \"Modern Times\" Rendezvous Entertainment 2005.\n\n\nMarc's career boasts many #1 hits on the R&R contemporary jazz charts, as well as topping the Billboard charts. In 1995, R&R elected him Best New Artist of The Year, which was followed by his Gavin Award in 1998. He has also received numerous nominations for jazz awards in the US and Canada.\n\n\nRegularly touring with contemporary jazz artists like Dave Koz, Chris Botti, Jeff Lorber, Jeffrey Osborne, David Benoit, Larry Carlton and others, he also performs or records with Jazz Legends such as Peter Erskine, Jimmy Haslip, Mike Mainieri, Dave Valentin, Christian McBride, and Mark Egan to name a few. Marc was honoured when George Benson mentioned him as one of his favorite guitarists.", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Alex Bugnon & Marc Antoine"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Ghost Town Hangmen", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30 // Show 8 // ALL SALES ARE FINAL"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "The Red Lions", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $14 Adv & $18 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Earl Zero", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Reggae", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "Jamaican reggae singer, preformed the original version of \"None Shall Escape The Judgment\" - later made famous by Johnny Clarke.", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $14 Adv & $18 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "1419 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Latin Breeze", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433317, 37.782618], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Sheba Piano Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Latin Breeze at Sheba Piano Lounge: Don't let the hokey exterior fool you, this place offers a comfortable, even classy setting in the heart of the Fillmore.

His name is synonymous with the best of electronic music, and while he is already considered an icon that has not stopped him from continuing his work as an innovator. The Grammy-Award winner has laid down the groundwork for what it is to be a modern-day producer/DJ and is responsible not only for some of the best electronic dance music of all time, but also for inspiring a generation of up-and-coming young artists.\n\nBreaking down barriers and shattering records, Ti\u00ebsto has racked up the titles to prove his stature. In addition to being nominated for two Grammy\u2019s and winning the award for the first time in 2015, he has been named #1 DJ by Rolling Stone, voted \u201cThe Greatest DJ of All Time\u201d by Mixmag, ranked the #1 DJ in the world three times by DJ Mag, and was recently presented with the Edison Pop Oeuvre Lifetime Achievement Award (an honor he shares with David Bowie, Quincy Jones and U2 among others).\n\nAfter spending decades conquering the house and trance worlds with countless singles and albums, the superstar producer led the charge in helping electronic music crossover into the mainstream with his last album, A Town Called Paradise in 2014. The record saw Ti\u00ebsto expanding his musical horizons, and in doing so, capturing the attention of the world in a way he had never done before. His single \u201cRed Lights\u201d is now certified gold in the United States, Sweden and Canada, while \u201cWasted\u201d with Matthew Koma recently went platinum in the United States and is his highest-charting release to date. The album was a taste of what was to come, and in just the last year or so, Ti\u00ebsto has dropped new tunes with the likes of The Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, and pop sensation Natalie La Rose.\n\nThese types of collaborations are nothing new for Ti\u00ebsto, who believes in passing along his success. He has always been one step ahead and actively worked to usher in the next big thing, whether it be a song, a performance, a company, or even another artist. For years now, he has been helping up-and-coming acts in the electronic world find their way with his record label, Musical Freedom. He has been there to help usher in now well-known names like Martin Garrix and Oliver Heldens, to name a few. Aside from his label, he also took part in 7Up\u2019s DJing competition \u201cYour Shot.\u201d This unique competition gave aspiring DJ\u2019s the chance to learn the craft and the opportunity to perform alongside Ti\u00ebsto at Hakkasan and Wet Republic in Las Vegas.\n\nAt this point in his career, Ti\u00ebsto has toured the world countless times, and there are more festivals, venues, and stages that he has played than ones he hasn\u2019t. He has performed for millions at Ultra, Coachella, Tomorrowland, TomorrowWorld, Electric Daisy Carnival...and that is to say nothing of the innumerable clubs that he frequents as a headliner. He is one of the elite few DJs in the world that can control a residency in Las Vegas, where he plays at Hakkasan and Wet Republic\u2014the best club and pool party respectively in Sin City.\n\nWhen it comes to playing shows, Ti\u00ebsto says that to this day, he is still \u201caddicted to the feeling of DJing.\u201d He loves the interaction with the crowd and the feeling of being able to surprise them. The DJ added that playing live encourages him to challenge himself to make better music and to be a better DJ.\n\nIn spite of his hectic tour schedule, residency, and focus on creating new music, Ti\u00ebsto has not forgotten his roots. He has been a champion of the DJ mix for decades, and in the past few years, his Club Life compilations have become something to look forward to for those in the dance world. 2015 saw him release the most recent edition of the collection, Club Life: Volume Four, New York City, which celebrates the city that never sleeps. The name of the series is shared with the DJ\u2019s popular Sirius XM channel, which has become a go-to for anybody looking for great, breaking dance music. In addition, his weekly radio show is broadcast on 350 stations in 77 countries and has over 35 million listeners.\n\nTi\u00ebsto also continues his work as an expert remixer, his talents sought out by some of the biggest names in the world. He has been brought on to rework smash hits for the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Coldplay, Kanye West, Sam Smith, Ellie Goulding, David Guetta, Major Lazer, Calvin Harris, and many more. In 2015, he won his first Grammy Award for his massively popular remix of John Legend\u2019s \u201cAll Of Me.\u201d\n\nTi\u00ebsto is keeping busy outside of the studio and off the stage as well. He has become one of the few leaders in the music space that has been able to transition their influence and savvy to other industries. He is an important advisor to tech startups like Splice, Dubset and Doppler, helping to steer the trajectory of success that all three of these companies are enjoying. Even as investments in the music tech world rise, few artists have gotten so involved in creating the changes that the industry is looking for.\n\nMost recently, Ti\u00ebsto released his completely re-designed mobile app, where fans can consume all things Ti\u00ebsto including his extremely popular podcast. He has also leant his name and style to a variety of brands. Through current collaborations with T-Mobile and Budweiser and other soon to be revealed efforts in the fashion space, the DJ is helping bring dance music culture to more people than ever before.\n\nIn the past two decades, many artists have come and gone but Ti\u00ebsto remains not only one of the world\u2019s most prolific and enduring artists, but one of music\u2019s top innovators. 2016 will see no deviation from this norm. Even after all that he has accomplished, Ti\u00ebsto does not see his work as being done. \u201cDJing is my life,\u201d the man isn\u2019t afraid to admit.

An avid outdoorsman, he loves hiking, scampering on rocks and mountain biking. For their honeymoon, he and his wife Suzie traveled to Thailand and Cambodia, where they explored 12th Century Buddhist and Hindu Ruins that are one of the Seven Wonders of the World. More recently, they hiked a 15,000 foot mountain near Quito, Ecuador and trekked up to Machu Picchu in Peru. Andrew brings the same sort of wild, freewheeling spirit to the new project, which features a multitude of stylistic excursions centered around his crisp, high energy guitar lines, infectious melodies and in the pocket, funky grooves. With six tracks produced by top genre hit maker and fellow guitarist Nils and others co-produced by Andrew with Nils, Adventurous Soul draws on Andrew\u2019s foundational love for blues, rock, jazz and fusion while also exploring his musical wanderlust for Latin and world music. Complementing the 11 originals (mostly penned by Andrew, Nils or a collaboration of the two) are explosive re-imaginings of R&B classics by The Isley Brothers (\u201cWork To Do\u201d) and James Brown (\u201cPass The Peas\u201d). While inviting many of the regional musicians he works with in Northern California to create the foundational tracks \u2013 including some of the band members from his former longtime group Himalaya on \u201cPass The Peas\u201d \u2013 Andrew and Nils brought out some of the genre\u2019s big guns to take these powerhouse tunes over the top. These include saxophonists Jessy J and Eric Marienthal, keyboardist Jeff Lorber and some of the last-ever sessions by late drummer Ricky Lawson. The multi-talented Johnny Britt adds his mad skills both on vocals (on \u201cWork To Do\u201d and others) as well as trumpet and flugelhorn. Andrew\u2019s previous albums include Contemplation (2007) and Blue Funky Blue (2010), whose single \u201cPookie\u2019s Groove Revisited\u201d received significant airplay. He worked diligently on Adventurous Soul while performing gigs in the Sonoma and Napa Valley wine country and throughout Northern California. As he continues thriving as a performer at wineries, casinos and festivals, he has upped his game considerably as an independent smooth jazz artist by working with Nils, whose expertise has taken Andrew\u2019s Adventurous Soul to the next level. The two first met at one of Nils\u2019 gigs at Spaghettini, a prominent jazz club in Seal Beach, CA. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Nils\u2019 music for a long time and was happy to discover that he has a similar background as a jazz and rock fusion player,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cOur influences are so similar. The cool thing about working with him is that even though he\u2019s a guitarist himself and contributed some backing parts, he was very objective about my playing and focused on making me shine and bringing out the best in me. We live in different parts of California, so often I would send him rough mixes of new songs I was working on. He would tweak them and send them back quickly and blew me away with his sonic magic every time. I started call him my \u2018GG\u2019 \u2013 German Genius!\u201d ON STAGE The release of Blue Funky Blue opened up opportunities for Andrew to headline at California jazz hotspots like Spaghettini, but he has also continued to be in huge demand throughout Sonoma and Napa Valley for his winery shows as part of series, special occasions and soirees. Andrew\u2019s success mixing covers and originals in a \u201csmall footprint\u201d presentation with just him and his percussionist Osi Reginald Scott has led him to create a business and website called Wine Country Guitar Music. He has also honed this presentation for regular shows in recent years as part of the Reno Nugget Jazz Series at the hotel and casino of that name in Reno. On occasion, Andrew enjoys playing with a full band at rock venues as far away as Lake Tahoe. In San Francisco, Keith and his band have played at clubs like Enrico\u2019s on the North Beach jazz scene, Biscuits and Blues Union Room, and community events like The Haight Street Festival. Keith has also tapped into the growing music scene in Napa, where his band performs regularly at Downtown Joe\u2019s and Silo\u2019s Jazz Club. Other recent appearances include the Matanzas Creek Winery, Viansa Winery and the Cotati Jazz Festival. Closer to his home in Sonoma, the band has headlined at the El Dorado Grill. Down the coast, Keith has performed at the Gatsby Jazz Festival in Santa Barbara (with his longtime band Himalaya) and Monterey Live. When he was with the group Zulu Spear, the band played at major venues in SF, including the Great American Music Hall.

A powerful way to launch a truly Adventurous Soul, \u201cWork To Do\u201d features Andrew\u2019s crisp fluid melody, his playful interaction with Eric Marienthal\u2019s potent sax and irrepressible horn accents. Penned by Nils, \u201cLove You More\u201d is a pure balmy tropical flavored delight, with Andrew\u2019s snappy melody riding soulfully over old school soul-jazz keyboard textures. Along the way, the island cool gives way to a burst of high octane jamming. The bluesy, brassy funk jam \u201cMilk Shake\u201d and the dreamy, exotic \u201cSamba Dulce\u201d offer dynamic showcases for Andrew\u2019s sizzling interaction with his guest stars. \u201cMilk Shake\u201d shows Andrew\u2019s darker, bluesier electric edges while featuring some wild runs from Marienthal, the brassy sass of Johnny Britt\u2019s trumpet and Ricky Lawson\u2019s feisty groove. \u201cSamba Dulce\u201d reflects Andrew\u2019s gentler side as his fluid guitar flows along with Jessy J\u2019s sensual sax. Likewise, Jeff Lorber adds his inimitable retro-keyboard touches to the easy struttin\u2019 title track. The most progressive production by Andrews is the globally conscious \u201cNamaste Dance,\u201d which blends old school soul atmospheres, hypnotic vocalizing and a thumping dance groove \u2013 all of which combines to create spiritual house music. Nils\u2019 most dynamic turn behind the boards is the high energy twist on James Brown\u2019s \u201cPass The Peas,\u201d which features some fun shout outs of the title, a bluesy foundation and an infectious Euro Dance beat. FROM THE BEGINNING Originally from Baltimore, Keith began playing guitar at 10 years old and as teenager moved with his family to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he was exposed to the rich and diverse SF music scene. His musical passions eventually led him to Los Angeles, where he had the opportunity to study with some of the world\u2019s greatest jazz and contemporary guitarists, including Robben Ford, Joe Pass, Buzz Fieten, Scott Henderson and Joe Diorio. While attending college in Los Angeles, Keith was a featured soloist with the Chaffey College Jazz Ensemble, earning several awards for outstanding musicianship from the National Association of Jazz Educators. He later went on to attend the world-renowned Guitar Institute of Technology. Graduating at the top of his class, he subsequently joined the faculty as a staff instructor. Shortly after graduating from the Guitar Institute, Keith teamed with keyboardist and composer Morris Beeks, with whom he formed the jazz/R&B band Himalaya. The Himalaya sound was soon defined by Keith's unique compositions, which made them one of the most popular and dynamic groups on the L.A. circuit. Himalaya\u2019s debut album Friend to Friend received national airplay. Shortly thereafter, they embarked on a nationwide tour with notable appearances at the Santa Barbara Jazz Festival as well as major nightclubs and venues in New York, Washington D.C., Memphis and San Diego. Since moving back to the Bay Area, Keith\u2019s style has gravitated towards world jazz fusion. His taste for world music was also inspired by performing at some of the top bay area venues with the popular South African band Zulu Spear. It was with that band the he teamed up with two great musicians from Austin Texas, multi-instrumentalists and producers, Cecil (P-Nut) Daniels and Carlton Lowe, who have been at the core of many of Keith's SF based recording and live performance projects. They have also formed the popular groups Sound Minds and P-Nut and The Apocalypse. REVIEWS \u201cIn my rave review of Keith Andrew\u2019s Blue Funky Blue a few years ago, I called the disc \u201cadventurous\u201d, never dreaming that this word would be part of the title and the overriding vibe of his latest album, Adventurous Soul, a wild, festive and funky set which takes the concept to even higher levels. The genius of what Andrew and his producer Nils \u2013 a renowned #1 artist in his own right \u2013 have created is that it perfectly balances instantly hummable melodies, funky grooves and Andrew\u2019s crisp, soulful playing with crazy-fun excursions to unexpected places.

Now releasing a new album titled Mama\u2019s Hometown, Celso has established a solid career, becoming one of the busiest and most respected blues artists in Southern California.\n\nBrazilian guitarist Celso Salim had his first contact with the guitar when he was six years old. At the age of 12 the talented young musician started to listen to his first Blues records, which changed his life forever. Since then Celso knew what he wanted to be, a Blues guitarist. For years he studied guitar hours each day, learning from old records by artists such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Freddie King, BB King, and Johnny Winter. A little later he began listening to 60\u2019s & 70\u2019s artists like the Allman Brothers Band, Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. At age 17, Celso moved to the US for the first time, spending 3 years studying music and performing live shows. During this period he was exposed to other genres like Soul, Jazz, Folk and Country. This time would later have great influence on Celso\u2019s music.\n\nIn Brazil, Celso has built a solid fan base, releasing 5 solo albums since 2001 and is considered to be one of the best guitarists in the country. He has also toured and recorded with prominent artists in the Brazilian Blues/Rock scene. Frequently featured among top Brazilian acts, Celso has performed at it's biggest festivals and venues.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "To RSVP email winecountryconcerts@gmail.com"}, {"Address": "1840 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "The Injex", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9027516.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.452592, 37.769515], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Milk Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "924 Gilman St, Berkeley, CA 94706", "Artist": "Cut-Rate Druggist", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10093364.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299296, 37.879505], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Rock And Roll", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "924 Gilman", "moreBioInfo": "Rock n Roll Bass & Drum Duo", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "389 Grand Ave, Oakland, CA 94610", "Artist": "J Boogie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9134506.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.25427, 37.808492], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Soul, Bhangra, Downtempo, Hip-hop, Afro Beat, Dub, Funk, Bass, Club Dj, Latin, Dancehall, Reggae", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Room 389", "moreBioInfo": "Known for his eclectic and international taste-making DJ sets, J Boogie has rocked massive festival stages, intimate clubs, underground radio and everything in between.

Pulling from lead guitarist and singer Brian J\u2019s deep discography of influences, the creation of Jukestone Paradise began a decade ago, when he penned anthems like \u201cSky\u201d and \u201cFreedom Dancer,\u201d all the way up to the album\u2019s studio recording sessions.\n\nYou might accurately call the Pimps of Joytime a \u2018post-genre\u2019 band; they\u2019re a group whose sound\u2014even within a single song\u2014mirrors the diversity of our era\u2019s musical tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s a sonic tapestry that\u2019s representative of this time and place that we live in,\u201d says Brian J.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Pimps excel, by mashing up \u201870s funk tones with modern dance beats, mixed with original samples creating their mosaic sound. For listeners weary of today\u2019s DJ culture but eager to dance with abandon, the Pimps of Joytime are the antidote.\n\n\u201cAt our core, the Pimps of Joytime are not just dance music,\u201d says Brian J of the band\u2019s three-part harmony attack. \u201cMy first vocal mentor was a doo-wop singer, so I have a long-time love affair with vocal harmonies.\u201d\n\nWith the release of Jukestone Paradise, the band makes official their solid touring lineup, featuring dual female vocalists and percussionists Mayteana Morales and Cole WilliamsX. And they\u2019re hitting the road hard, continuing a constant touring schedule that\u2019s already left prominent sets at festivals like Voodoo, Outside Lands, Bonnaroo and High Sierra in their wake.\n\nBehind the frontlines are bassist/keyboardist David Bailis and drummer John Staten, forming the rhythmic backbone of the Pimps\u2019 audible collage. And for Jukestone Paradise, they called in a few friends to lend their talents, including Ivan Neville, who lends New Orleans flavor to \u201cSky,\u201d and Rubblebucket\u2019s Alex Toth, who co-wrote the quirky and infectious \u201cDance Cardia.\u201d\n\nJust as Brooklyn has changed since the Pimps started, so has the band\u2019s sound. But as Williamsburg gentrifies, the Pimps of Joytime\u2019s diverse evolution keeps the neighborhood\u2019s spirit alive.

His former Moldy Peaches bandmate, Kimya Dawson, is now also a solo anti-folk artist. Green is now best known for the solo career he began in 2002. His most famous (and notorious) song is probably, \"Jessica\", off 2003's full-length album, \"Friends of Mine\".\n\nOften compared to Ben Folds, Leonard Cohen, Ben Kweller, and Jonathan Richman, Green's off-kilter indie alternative folk style has achieved a moderate college radio following in the United States and enjoys increasing popularity in different European countries, particularly Germany.\n\nGreen attended Emerson College for one semester in 1998 before leaving to concentrate on his music, going on to co-found the anti folk group The Moldy Peaches with Kimya Dawson.\n\nIn 2002 The Moldy Peaches went on hiatus and Green embarked on a solo career.\n\nGreen released several albums on Rough Trade Records. Among his better known songs are the aforementioned \"Jessica\" (about singer Jessica Simpson), \"Novotel\", \"Friends of Mine\", \"Dance with Me\", \"Carolina\" and \"Emily\", and, in Britain, his cover of The Libertines track \"What a Waster\".\n\nPrior to Jacket Full of Danger in 2006, all of Green's albums had been released on the 22nd of the month. His latest album was released on March 18th, 2008 and is titled Sixes & Sevens. Titles include \"Morning After Midnight,\" \"Twee Twee Dee,\" and \"Drowning Head First,\" the latter a duet between Green and his girlfriend.\n\nIn January 2008, The Moldy Peaches began having a resurgence in popularity, due to their music being included in the hit indie film Juno. Most notably, a duet between Adam Green and Kimya Dawson, The Moldy Peaches song \"Anyone Else But You\" was featured in the film, and also in a scene which features the films lead actors, Michael Cera and Ellen Page performing the song together.

After an extensive touring career of over 20 years with luminaries like Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Al Jarreau, Stan Getz, David Sanborn, Joe Sample, Cassandra Wilson, Clark Terry, Dianne Reeves and more, she returned to her hometown where she was appointed professor at her alma mater, Berklee College of Music. Terri Lyne also received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 2003.\n\nAfter studying under full scholarship at Berklee, with the encouragement of her mentor, Jack DeJohnette, Carrington moved to New York in 1983. For 5 years she was a much in-demand musician, working with James Moody, Lester Bowie, Pharoah Sanders, and others. In the late \u201880s she relocated to Los Angeles, where she gained recognition on late night TV as the house drummer for the Arsenio Hall Show, then again in the late \u201890s as the drummer on the Quincy Jones late night TV show, VIBE, hosted by Sinbad.\n\nIn 1989, Carrington released a GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated debut CD on Verve entitled Real Life Story, which featured Carlos Santana, Grover Washington Jr., Wayne Shorter, Patrice Rushen, Gerald Albright, John Scofield, Greg Osby, and Hiram Bullock. Other solo CDs include 2002\u2019s Jazz is a Spirit, which features Herbie Hancock, Gary Thomas, Wallace Roney, Terence Blanchard, Kevin Eubanks, and Bob Hurst, and 2004\u2019s Structure, a cooperative group which features Adam Rogers, Jimmy Haslip and Greg Osby. Both CDs were released on the Europe-based ACT Music label and enjoyed considerable media attention and critical acclaim in the European and Japanese markets.\n\nCarrington\u2019s production and songwriting collaborations with artists such as Gino Vannelli, Peabo Bryson, Dianne Reeves, Siedah Garrett, Marilyn Scott have produced notable works as well, including her production of the Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated CD, That Day, as well as Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD, Beautiful Life, in 2014.\n\nCarrington has performed on many recordings throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s thru today. Notable examples of her work include Herbie Hancock\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD Gershwin\u2019s World, where she played alongside Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder. She has toured in many of Hancock\u2019s musical configurations (from electric to acoustic) and is featured on his Future2Future DVD.\n\nAfter a hiatus from the U.S. recording scene as a solo recording artist, Carrington returned in 2008 with More To Say... (Real Life Story: NextGen). Joining her was an impressive all-star cast of jazz and contemporary jazz instrumentalists, including George Duke, Everette Harp, Kirk Whalum, Jimmy Haslip, Greg Phillinganes, Gregoire Maret, Christian McBride, Danilo Perez, Patrice Rushen, Robert Irving III (who also serves as co-producer), Chuck Loeb, Dwight Sills, and legendary vocalists Les McCann and Nancy Wilson.\n\nCarrington released The Mosaic Project in 2011, her fifth recording overall and first on Concord Jazz. The critically acclaimed CD, which won a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, gathered a myriad of voices and crystallized them into a multi-faceted whole that far outweighed the sum of its parts. She produced the 14-song set which included some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades: Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sheila E., Nona Hendryx, Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen and several others. Carrington said the emergence of so many great female jazz instrumentalists over the last couple of decades is what made an album like The Mosaic Project possible.\n\nIn 2013, Carrington released Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue, her much anticipated homage to Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Max Roach, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of their iconic 1963 Money Jungle album. The recording featured Gerald Clayton and Christian McBride, with guests Clark Terry, Lizz Wright, Herbie Hancock and others. Carrington made history when she became the first woman to win a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Carrington releases The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL. Like its predecessor, the album presents Carrington leading a rotating cast of superb female instrumentalists and vocalists that includes Oleta Adams, Natalie Cole, Paula Cole, Lalah Hathaway, Chaka Khan, Chant\u00e9 Moore, Valerie Simpson, Nancy Wilson, Jaguar Wright and Lizz Wright, as well as saxophonist Tia Fuller, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen; bassists Meshell Ndegoecello and Linda Oh; and keyboardists Geri Allen, Patrice Rushen and Rachel Z.\n\nOn The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL, Carrington juxtaposes her salute to female artists by paying homage to various male artists who have either influenced her professionally and/or informed her musicality, such as Nick Ashford, George Duke, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Luther Vandross and Bill Withers. \u201cWhenever I do something that celebrates women, I never want it to feel like it\u2019s something that excludes men,\u201d she explains. \u201cOn this record, I consciously wanted to celebrate the various relationships women have with men either through original songs of mine or cover songs by male composers and song writers.\u201d The male presence and perspective on The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL is even more realized by Billy Dee Williams, who contributes insightful spoken-word interludes through the disc.", "otherInfo": "This evening celebrates the centenary of one of the most innovative and influential artists in modern musical history, but rather than imitating the original, it explores new perspectives on Parker's signature style.\n\nCo-directed by Terri Lyne Carrington and Rudresh Mahanthappa."}, {"Address": "3140 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Guardianes del amor", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419282, 37.747238], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Roccapulco", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "401 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Javier Perianes", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.420688, 37.779613], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Herbst Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tabea Zimmermann and Javier Perianes According to the London Telegraph, Tabea Zimmermann's artistry is perfectly matched in the 'luminosity' of Javier Perianes' playing."}, {"Address": "1807 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "James Elkington", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Fox Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ticket delivery delay until after 2/7/20."}, {"Address": "3660 Stony Point Rd, Santa Rosa, CA 95407", "Artist": "Control", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7695441.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.74098, 38.387671], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Casa Del Mar", "moreBioInfo": "There is more than one artist with this name:\n\n\n1) Control (formerly known as Broken Bodies) is a hardcore band from Washington, DC.\n\n2) Control is a power electronics outfit of noise musician Thomas Garrison.

The saxophonist/composer hybridizes progressive jazz and South Indian classical music in a fluid and forward-looking form reflecting his own experience growing up a second-generation Indian-American. Just as his personal experience is never wholly lived on one side of the hyphenate or the other, his music speaks in a voice dedicated to forging a new path forward.\n\nThe current manifestations of that trajectory include his latest project Bird Calls (2015), which was named #1 album of the year by both Downbeat and NPR Music\u2019s Jazz Critics Poll. This 21st Century tribute to Charlie Parker, which Downbeat Magazine recently named Best Album of 2015, includes a stellar band of pianist Matt Mitchell, bassist Franc\u0327ois Moutin, drummer Rudy Royston, and 20-year old trumpet prodigy Adam O\u2019Farrill. The 2013 album Gamak featured guitarist David \u201cFuze\u201d Fiuczynski, whose own microtonal vocabulary opened new possibilities for Mahanthappa\u2019s compositional imagination, alongside bassist Francois Moutin and drummer Dan Weiss. The 2010 release of Samdhi (ACT Music + Vision), a multi-cultural ensemble that advances Mahanthappa\u2019s blend of jazz and Indian music with modernist electronic music, was described by JazzTimes as \u201ca landmark convergence of styles that didn't lend itself to easy analysis... new music of this caliber hasn't been attempted before.\u201d Other recent projects run the gamut from the cross-generational alto summit Apex featuring Bunky Green; trios MSG and Mauger; the quintet Dual Identity co-led with fellow altoist Steve Lehman; and Raw Materials, his long-running duo project with pianist Vijay Iyer. Mahanthappa also continues to partner with Pakistani-American guitarist Rez Abbasi and innovative percussionist Dan Weiss in the Indo-Pak Coalition, while giants in both jazz and South Indian music have recognized his success: he was enlisted by Jack DeJohnette for the legendary drummer\u2019s new working group, while a collaboration with the renowned Carnatic saxophonist Kadri Gopalnath resulted in Mahanthappa\u2019s critically- acclaimed 2008 CD Kinsmen (Pi).\n\nHailed by the New York Times as possessing \u201ca roving intellect and a bladelike articulation,\u201d Mahanthappa has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, two New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowships, and numerous commissions. He has been named alto saxophonist of the year four of the past five years in Downbeat Magazine\u2019s International Critics Polls and for five years running by the Jazz Journalists\u2019 Association.

Quit being afraid of change. Accept yourself. Stop believing everything you read or see on TV, and ask yourself how you really feel.\u201d\n\nPart of the excitement of Danava and their music is witnessing it all unfold. Songs that would seem like stunts on paper leverage stylistic shifts, tempo changes, and expressive instrumental virtuosity to where it sounds as natural as conversation. Leaner, more at ease with its daunting, hyper-complex countenance, Danava\u2019s music now possesses a smirking confidence both hard-fought and well-worn. You\u2019ll hear it all over UnonoU.

In the relentless leads of \u201cSpinning Temple Shifting,\u201d and the theatrical doom of \u201cDown from a Cloud, Up from the Ground.\u201d Those string and horn arrangements you didn\u2019t expect to hear today flesh out the album with a degree of sophistication unexpected in this kind of rock. Through it all, Sparkles is blessed with a familiar, hectoring tenor, and he really knows how to project, even in those higher registers.\n\nSparkles credits the expanse in Danava\u2019s sound to an improved recording situation. \u201cOn our first album, we felt really rushed, under the gun to produce something great in time for release,\u201d he explains. \u201cWith UnonoU, things worked much more at the speed which we\u2019re comfortable with.\u201d Recorded in Kemado\u2019s NYC studio facilities, the group had plenty of time to experiment with new ideas, and flesh out songs in the recording environment.\n\nDanava reaches back to the whole of a musical history beyond metal, and fuses the results into a cohesive end result. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stand out,\u201d Sparkles confesses. \u201cWhat matters to us is that we can say we\u2019re doing our own thing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "HEAVY PSYCH SOUNDS FEST 2020 has been canceled."}, {"Address": "222 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "LENA HALL", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8919856.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.409274, 37.785697], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop, Punk, Soul, Rock, Acoustic, R&b, Musical Theater", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Feinstein's at The Nikko", "moreBioInfo": "LENA HALL is a Tony Award winner and Grammy nominee who will appear opposite Jennifer Connelly in TNT\u2019s science fiction epic \u201cSnowpiercer.\u201d Following her Tony winning Broadway run in Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Lena toured North America alongside Josh Groban on his \u201cStages\u201d tour and portrayed the dual starring roles of Hedwig and Yitzhak in Hedwig in Los Angeles (LA Drama Critics Circle nomination) and San Francisco.

FUBAR, an acronym for Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition, sees the producer synthesizing and mutating his sound into all shades of bass music\u2014halftime, dubstep, garage and everything in between\u2014while still retaining his signature L.A. beat scene style. Created with the high-intensity energy of a club and festival setting, FUBAR features nine hard-hitting tracks, including standout singles \u201cDragon of the Darkness Flame\u201d and \u201cKimchi Crisis,\u201d plus \u201cLittle Mac,\u201d a collaboration with Mr. Carmack. With FUBAR, Tsuruda enters his next creative chapter, one marked by a deeper sense of bass experimentalism and open-minded creativity.\n\nWidely known for his idiosyncratic, third-eye-opening sets, Tsuruda is unmatched on the live front. In addition to headlining and high-profile sets at Infrasound Music Festival and Daybreak Festival, he\u2019s delivered mind-bending performances at some of the world\u2019s leading festivals and marquee events. In 2015, he joined G Jones and Slow Magic side by side for a legendary sunrise set at Emissions Music Festival. In 2017, he performed at the Oregon Eclipse Festival, a once-in-a-lifetime honor for the producer, followed by a supporting slot for dubstep icon Bassnectar at his Bass Center arena show. One year later, in 2018, Tsuruda was handpicked as one of the select artists to close out Low End Theory, the influential weekly series that birthed the Los Angeles beat scene. That same year, he unloaded unforgettable performances at premier events Shambhala Music Festival in Canada, where he dropped two sets, and Electric Forest, where an intimate crowd of 50 festival-goers mushroomed to 3,000 within minutes during his set. Elsewhere, Tsuruda has toured with the biggest beat-masters in the scene, including Mr. Carmack and Shades (EPROM and Alix Perez). Most recently in 2019, he made his debut at the internationally celebrated EDC Las Vegas, joined G Jones on his Ineffable Truth Tour, supported Amon Tobin across a number of US dates, and headlined his own solo tour in the fall in support of his latest release, FUBAR. Tsuruda now enters 2020 with a stacked schedule of upcoming tour dates and new music on the horizon.\n\nTsuruda\u2019s musical trajectory has been marked by a swift push into the bleeding edge of underground music and culture.

Mario was a member of Tony Alva\u2019s Alva Team skateboarding crew.

Earthless.\n\nThe trio, based out of San Diego, met through mutual friends and a fondness for under the radar record collections. Mario explains how the band connected, \u201cWe discovered a mutual admiration for a lot of Japanese psychedelic hard rock bands, as well as primitive \u201860s garage music. After combing over each other\u2019s record collections and lending out records, we came upon the idea of, \u2018Let\u2019s specifically start a Japanese-psychedelic-heavy-Kraut-rock-band.\u2019 With the Japanese bands, it was always a really kind of heavy, blues, twisted take on Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin. Isaiah is an awesome guitar player & Mike is an amazing bassist, playing with the both of them really sealed the deal. Magic happened in the room. Since then, we\u2019ve followed that formula.\u201d\n\nRecently signed to Tee Pee Records, Earthless issues their debut album, Rhythms from A Cosmic Sky, this May. While Mario, Mike and Isaiah can be the most precise of musicians, the group also revels in adding a healthy amount of jam to the mix, as evidenced by the album\u2019s two extended tracks \u201cGodspeed\u201d and \u201cSonic Prayer.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of improvisation, a lot of room to be spontaneous and wander off.

However, don\u2019t expect to hear faithful renditions of either of their new album\u2019s songs when the band plays live. \u201cNo brakes \u2013 just one, long continuous song to us. Even though some people that have seen us think, \u201cThat third song you played\u2026\u201d because it will shift into a different mood. But to us, it\u2019s just one long song. It can range anywhere from 25 minutes to an hour and a half\u2026 just full-on, loud, sonic power. Some people might not be able to take it, and some people love it. We just hope that someone can get enjoyment out of it like we do [laughs]. We have a couple of different jams \u2013 probably four or five different ones, and sometimes we mix them up.

He draws influence from the music of his upbringing; urban hip-hop, R&B, and rock, and combines them with the affluent Latin rhythms. His roots in the Latin power vocal style produce warm, beautiful tones as he exhales his melodies. Carlos Xavier is his name and singing is his game!\n\nCarlos engages his audience with his pure, passionate vocals. Backed by his band and his years of musical experience Carlos is able rise up and shine. His music has taken his groups all over the world. He has played with Los Mocosos at the East Coast Blues and Roots Festival in Australia as well as throughout the Caribbean as a cruise ship entertainer. Carlos has toured throughout the United States as well as Canada. When not on the road Carlos can be heard throughout nightclubs weekly.\n\nThe past years have served to educate and develop Carlos\u2019 talent as he currently heads his solo career. The result is outstanding musicianship and a fully developed, unique sound. His sound is very identifiable to the Latin American community as it draws from Latin Balada roots and meshes them with the rock and pop. His melodies are expressed through his passionate lyrics and his desire reach people\u2019s souls. The music world eagerly awaits the new sound of Carlos Xavier.\n\nCarlos Xavier fused his original songs with a New York salsa producer and East coast musicians, to create a unique style of salsa putting it in a league of its own. This salsa album ranges from R&B, Rock, Hip-Hop, Gospel, Blues, Vallenato to Latin Pop all within the rules of salsa. An album for all types of listeners to enjoy. I made an album to make you dance, laugh, sing, cry and simply to enjoy listening to. A must for DJ\u2019s and salsa music lovers.\n\nWhen I fell in love with salsa, about 22 years ago, it became my dream to make a salsa album. Especially using the musicians and producers that made the style of salsa that I loved. I never believed it would happen but it did. With this album I plan to bring that style of salsa back that I heard many years ago and make it relevant to today, all while making it my own.\n\nI grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a melting pot of cultures so I had many genres of music in my ear. My song writing style shows that and I\u2019m very proud of it. A first generation born American to parents born in Nicaragua, my Latin roots will always be who I am, and I feel fortunate to have grown up in an era where many styles of urban music were being brought to life. So I reflect that in my writing and want to offer the world my sound as a singer/songwriter.", "otherInfo": "Performing songs from his new album - VIVE TODO AHORA\n\nCARLOS XAVIER LIVE @ DANCE FRIDAYS IN SAN FRANCISCO\n\nSPACE 550\n\n550 BARNEVELD ST.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA 94124\n\n10PM - 12:30AM"}, {"Address": "146 S Murphy Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94086", "Artist": "Gareth Emery", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9112299.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.029756, 37.376782], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Dance Pop, Electronic, Trance", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Pure Lounge & Nightclub", "moreBioInfo": "Check out all Gareth Emery music on Spotify:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/GE-MUSIC", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "915 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Jim McVeigh", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10237614.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414334, 37.802895], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Standup Comedy, Comedy", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Cobb's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Jim McVeigh is a stand up comic based in the SF Bay Area", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1539 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Back", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.414361, 37.771234], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Wish", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Back & 4th\" w/ resident DJ Jayvi Velasco"}, {"Address": "3660 Stony Point Rd, Santa Rosa, CA 95407", "Artist": "Grupo Mandingo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9027382.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.74098, 38.387671], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Balada, Norte\u00f1o, Cachaca, Grupo Musical, Cumbia Romantica", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "Casa Del Mar", "moreBioInfo": "www.grupomandingo.com.\nPagina oficial de Mandingo en facebook.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
