This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

He took me to the Beacon, The Ryman, Massey Hall, all these leg-endary rooms. Just to see that what I could do would even translate in spaces like that was revelatory.\u201d\n\nHarper says he instantly recognized a kindred spirit in Stelling\u2019s virtuosic finger picking and soulful delivery. \u201cIt was like finding a John Fahey or Leo Kottke that was a really great singer,\u201d he explains.\n\nThe recording of Best Of Luck culminated on a rainy night in Los Angeles, but the whole thing really began back in North Carolina. Stelling calls Asheville home, though he has been in a state of near constant motion for years. Leaving Florida while young to roam and perfect his craft, he made stops in Colorado, Boston, Seattle, New York and eventually North Carolina - all interspersed with relentless touring - hundreds of performances a year, in bars, coffee houses, nightclubs and theaters.\n\n\u201cThe lifestyle of constant touring was gaining on me,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd then I was back home, and in the abrupt silence, there was a clarity. The fumes of hubris I had been running on for years were all but gone and my relationship with my environment and myself had turned toxic. I was scared but resolved to persevere. On Christmas Day, after a few false starts, I gave up drinking and decided to take a look at myself.\u201d\n\nAnd then, as if following some greater cosmic narrative, an email arrived that New Year\u2019s Day. It was Harper asking if he would be interested in making a record in Los Angeles. \u201cI had never worked with a producer before,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cI had always con-trolled everything; it was how I had survived. But I needed a mentor and a friend; I was too far from shore.\"\n\nStelling accepted an artist\u2019s residency at the Stetson Kennedy House outside of Jack-sonville Florida to prepare. Kennedy had been a folklorist and comrade of Woody Guthrie and Zora Neale Hurston. Woody stayed there for extended periods as well. \u201cI moved into this little house in a North Florida swamp just an hour from where I was born and raised,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd I proceeded to freak out. It was the first time I\u2019d just sat still for years. Mostly, I took inventory of myself. But I left feeling like I\u2019d found a thread. After that, I would send Ben demos. He would respond with encouragement and tell me to keep digging, so I\u2019d keep digging. Looking back, the whole process was the medicine I needed.\u201d\n\nBest Of Luck is a supremely accessible and finely crafted record that deftly merges genres. Harper, who has previously produced records by Mavis Staples, Rickie Lee Jones, The Blind Boys of Alabama and others, recruited an all-star rhythm section with Jimmy Paxson (Stevie Nicks, Dixie Chicks) on drums and upright bass player Mike Va-lerio (Randy Newman, LA Philharmonic) to lend a versatility and finesse. \u201cI really be-lieve this record is the intersection where folk and soul meet,\u201d Harper says.\n\nThe album\u2019s title, Best Of Luck, mirrored perfectly the emotional landscape in which it was created. \u201cDepending on how you say it, it can either be a blessing or a dismissal,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd that was exactly the point I was coming to with myself, my career as an artist, as a friend and as a person.\u201d\n\nThe first track, \u201cHave To Do For Now\u201d is a haunting evocation of a moment between an unexamined past and an uncertain future. The guitar refrain evokes a beautiful sense of wistfulness about the past. \u201cIt\u2019s a song about the fear of losing memories and the re-lief of letting them go,\u201d Stelling explains. \u201cIt was written in one sitting. A flood of memo-ries moving back to when I was very young and I fell from a tree house and split my head open. I\u2019d never really processed that trauma but it\u2019s one of my earliest and most visceral memories. I can\u2019t help but wonder how that day and others like it have influ-enced my life.\u201d\n\nThe sonic simplicity of \u201cLucky Stars\u201d reveals a richness of melody and emotionality. \u201cIt\u2019s part love song, part lullaby,\u201d Stelling says of the track, \u201cwith a gentle touch from the band and Ben\u2019s haunting lap steel matching my guitar in the instrumental section, ad-ditional vocals by my partner. It\u2019s about gratitude and the mysteries of the universe. Even to just be here and marvel at it all is enough for me most times. Even if it\u2019s mean-ingless, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nThroughout the record, discontent and self-doubt are transformed into messages of resilience and hope. \u201cTrouble Don\u2019t Follow Me\u201d captures this perfectly, with an upbeat almost anthemic rhythm and soulful, gospel-tinged vocals. \u201cIt comes as no surprise to me that one of my most optimistic songs could be written in the most difficult hour,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cWhen all I needed was a little hope and a song I could play night after night and not get tired of. Something that captured the basic recipe for endurance. A song about marching on, a warning to anything that might stand in your way, and needing to feel strong for the people around you, so you can inspire them to do the same.\u201d\n\nThere is an uninhibited defiance to \u201cUntil I Die,\u201d a revved up folk-blues featuring a beautifully raw guitar and beat. \u201cThis song is a kaleidoscope in the hall of mirrors, a psychedelic rant,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cOne thing is for certain amidst the chaos and uncer-tainty, and that is having someone to love and who loves you back is unrivaled.\u201d\n\nWhen Harper talks about his admiration for Stelling, he refers to his family\u2019s legendary folk music store, filled with instruments and a fluid merging of styles and genres. \u201cWhen I listen to Chris, I hear my grandparent\u2019s store in Claremont,\u201d Harper says. \u201cHe\u2019s carrying on that tradition. A guy that can play any instrument from any country and play it with real feeling. He crosses genres but manages to respect them; he is a folk singer with an unusual soulfulness. He understands where this music comes from and why it\u2019s remains so essential. Of all the record\u2019s I have produced, this is one I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Stelling says, \u201cThis record was about learning to trust the people around me. If anything, after years of closely guarded decision-making I\u2019m delighted by the re-sults of this collaboration. This record has an undeniable sense of clarity. The songs are lean but never feel incomplete. Ben knew how to coax me out of my well-worn comfort zones, how to move fast and spontaneously and put me on the spot, and how to retreat and give me space to process things. People who know me have said they hear a lot more of me in this album than anything before. Realizing I couldn\u2019t heal the world, I started to heal myself, and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased by how that sounds.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2209 Broadway St, Redwood City, CA 94063-1641", "Artist": "Wishbone Ash", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.2293, 37.48637], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "CLUB FOX", "moreBioInfo": "History ::\nFormed in 1969, Wishbone Ash has more than 20 original studio recordings and several live albums to their credit.

Either way, it\u2019s safe to assume that Larry June, born Larry Hendricks, is the most colorful and unique rapper out right now spreading an authentic message of health and positivity.\n\nBorn April 8, 1991, in San Francisco to a musical family, Larry cites his cousin, a young rapper signed to Too Short, as the primary reason he went into music. June made his first beat around age 7 and 8 and released his first mixtape when he was 16 without any formal training, instead explaining that he \u201cjust got into rapping.\u201d The San Francisco native also calls Atlanta home, citing the two cities\u2019s variety of sounds, tempos, coasts and cultures as crucial to his music.\n\nEvident from his clever and musical ad libbing, the rapper gains most of his inspiration from Bootsy Collins, James Brown, and Michael Jackson. Much like these artists, June uses his voice as a musical agent, or, as he puts it, \u201cI look at ad libs as the instrument with the beat.\u201d He often freestyles adding to the witty charm obvious in his tracks and the fervent energy with a slowed-down groove element akin to the 70s soul music June listens to everyday\u2014complete with a photo of Lionel Richie on his refrigerator.\n\nInside his fridge, however, must be a plethora of oranges as the rapper is known for his iconic health advice and benefits of Vitamin C. The color is reminiscent of the 70s aesthetic and sound June seeks in his music and the health benefits of the fruit propagate his message of being good: \u201cYou got an orange, you\u2019re doing good.\u201d This playful element is reiterated in June\u2019s visual work and complementary material, such as the iOS game Orange Season accompanying his EP of the same name. June has plans to create a new, more impactful game in the future hinting at a possible collaboration.\n\nWhile June comes across as clever and humorous in his freestyles and symbolisms, his flow is nowhere near lighthearted territory. June displays an impressive command of his flows, never breaking his characteristic monotone delivery and easily spits out messages of life\u2019s complexities and nuances without missing a beat. After touring with Post Malone, who discovered him on Twitter with the internet buzzing around June\u2019s music, and tours with Asher Roth under his belt, the rapper secured a deal with Warner Bros. and is expected to release his new EP You\u2019re Doing Good.\n\nThe EP marks a departure from his previous EPs Larry and Orange Season with its experimental component in the production. \u201cI experimented with a lot of different sounds and wanted to try something with it. The flows didn\u2019t really change, it\u2019s just the beats that changed,\u201d says the rapper. The album came from a desire to create and maintain a positive outlook: \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t feeling too good so I wanted to change to a positive perspective\u2014you\u2019re doing good because you are good,\u201d says June. He attributes the music to what his state of mind was at the time and this attempt to try every type of sound\u2014hence the experimental aspect of You\u2019re Doing Good.\n\nIndeed, You\u2019re Doing Good is heavily inspiring from the 80s influenced \u201cToo Live Crew\u201d to the more soul-inspired, bedroom jams \u201cThrow Sum\u201d and \u201cFall in Love\u201d. Each track is both stylistically and content-wise a bit different, but maintains that characteristic Larry June ethos. Of his top 3 tracks, June chooses \u201cSo Organic\u201d, \u201cToo Live Crew\u201d, and \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d for their distinct moods\u2014the \u201cbest moods\u201d for songs and some degree of relatability for everyone according to the rapper.\n\nJune continues the heat, health, and determination going for 2018\u2014completely deserving of the \u201cGood Job, Larry\u201d motivation.", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:00pm // Show 8:00pm // All Ages // $30 Early Bird GA // $35 General Admission"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "T.S.O.L.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7419206.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "T.S.O.L.

Formed in Montebello Anti-Social was led by Charlie Cordova (bass & lead vocals) and Manny Cordova (guitar)with Gabriel Marquez on drums. With this three-piece line up the band started playing house parties as well as underground hall and warehouse shows around East L.A. and SGV In 1987 Gabriel Marquez decided to leave the band and word of this reach this up and coming drummer from the local scene named Armando Del Rio who joined the band after a few solid rehearsals. The line up went on to hit the punk scene throughout 1990 playing anywhere and everywhere they could with such acts like The Vandals, MDC, and even a little known band from Garden Grove called The Offspring. At this time the band had begun to record several demos that saw respectable sales at the bands shows as well as at several local independent record stores. Anti-Social has begun to garner a sizable following. In 1990 Del Rio left to pursue his ventures with some other projects. Manny and Charlie pushed forward with various other drummers for the next few years thanks to Richard Ramirez, Pat Cici, and Frank. Anti-Social continued to prove itself a force in the punk rock circuit until it's demise in 1994. 2004 had seen the return of Anti-Social with Manny, Charlie and Mando getting together for one off/reunion shows here and there with drummer Tim Baca filling the drum spot as well throughout the end of 2006. In 2007 the line-up of Manny and Charles Cordova and Tim Baca reunited to pick up where it had left off decades before playing several great shows and garnering great revues in local rags. The boys have since been giving stellar performances and have recorded a handful of old and new songs that can be heard in the bands live set. The material has been getting great responses and the band has made many new friends as they rip up the punk scene once again. The band has even begun to have a new recording of an old tune \"Darkness in the World\", get regular spins on KROQ's locals only specialty show. Not a bad way to get the ball rolling wouldn't you say? More recently the band's shows have continued the tradition of Anti-Social teaming up with such great acts as The Varukers, The Lurkers (U.K), old school acts like The Nip Drivers and Jody Fosters Army, and more modern acts like The Voids, just to name a few. The band has completed a new full length that will be released in 2016 that will include both old and new material. The current lineup is Charlie, Manny, and Chuck on drums who has been part of the Anti-Social family since its inception.

Either way, it\u2019s safe to assume that Larry June, born Larry Hendricks, is the most colorful and unique rapper out right now spreading an authentic message of health and positivity.\n\nBorn April 8, 1991, in San Francisco to a musical family, Larry cites his cousin, a young rapper signed to Too Short, as the primary reason he went into music. June made his first beat around age 7 and 8 and released his first mixtape when he was 16 without any formal training, instead explaining that he \u201cjust got into rapping.\u201d The San Francisco native also calls Atlanta home, citing the two cities\u2019s variety of sounds, tempos, coasts and cultures as crucial to his music.\n\nEvident from his clever and musical ad libbing, the rapper gains most of his inspiration from Bootsy Collins, James Brown, and Michael Jackson. Much like these artists, June uses his voice as a musical agent, or, as he puts it, \u201cI look at ad libs as the instrument with the beat.\u201d He often freestyles adding to the witty charm obvious in his tracks and the fervent energy with a slowed-down groove element akin to the 70s soul music June listens to everyday\u2014complete with a photo of Lionel Richie on his refrigerator.\n\nInside his fridge, however, must be a plethora of oranges as the rapper is known for his iconic health advice and benefits of Vitamin C. The color is reminiscent of the 70s aesthetic and sound June seeks in his music and the health benefits of the fruit propagate his message of being good: \u201cYou got an orange, you\u2019re doing good.\u201d This playful element is reiterated in June\u2019s visual work and complementary material, such as the iOS game Orange Season accompanying his EP of the same name. June has plans to create a new, more impactful game in the future hinting at a possible collaboration.\n\nWhile June comes across as clever and humorous in his freestyles and symbolisms, his flow is nowhere near lighthearted territory. June displays an impressive command of his flows, never breaking his characteristic monotone delivery and easily spits out messages of life\u2019s complexities and nuances without missing a beat. After touring with Post Malone, who discovered him on Twitter with the internet buzzing around June\u2019s music, and tours with Asher Roth under his belt, the rapper secured a deal with Warner Bros. and is expected to release his new EP You\u2019re Doing Good.\n\nThe EP marks a departure from his previous EPs Larry and Orange Season with its experimental component in the production. \u201cI experimented with a lot of different sounds and wanted to try something with it. The flows didn\u2019t really change, it\u2019s just the beats that changed,\u201d says the rapper. The album came from a desire to create and maintain a positive outlook: \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t feeling too good so I wanted to change to a positive perspective\u2014you\u2019re doing good because you are good,\u201d says June. He attributes the music to what his state of mind was at the time and this attempt to try every type of sound\u2014hence the experimental aspect of You\u2019re Doing Good.\n\nIndeed, You\u2019re Doing Good is heavily inspiring from the 80s influenced \u201cToo Live Crew\u201d to the more soul-inspired, bedroom jams \u201cThrow Sum\u201d and \u201cFall in Love\u201d. Each track is both stylistically and content-wise a bit different, but maintains that characteristic Larry June ethos. Of his top 3 tracks, June chooses \u201cSo Organic\u201d, \u201cToo Live Crew\u201d, and \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d for their distinct moods\u2014the \u201cbest moods\u201d for songs and some degree of relatability for everyone according to the rapper.\n\nJune continues the heat, health, and determination going for 2018\u2014completely deserving of the \u201cGood Job, Larry\u201d motivation.", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:00pm // Show 8:00pm // All Ages // $30 Early Bird GA // $35 General Admission"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Strangelight", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "A Collaboration Between UNIFORM & THE BODY\nDreamdecay\nStrangelight\n8 pm\n$15 adv / $17 doors\nAll Ages"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "The Soft White Sixties", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8761278.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, Rock, Roll, R&B, Psych Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "ALTA CALIFORNIA is out now!\nAvailable worldwide in English or Spanish\nthesoftwhitesixties.com", "otherInfo": "FAST TIMES.! with The Soft White Sixties at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "18 Harlan Pl, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Bisi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8299005.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4046934, 37.7902089], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: International, Pop, Reggae, World Fusion Soul, Folk, Acoustic Pop, Hip Hop, Rock, Alternative, World Music, World Fusion (soul Folk, Reggae, Rock, World", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bar Fluxus", "moreBioInfo": "Bisi is the world music fusion artist whose music is a unique blend of folk, reggae, soul, rock, r&b, world beats, and afro beats.

After years of playing together, they officially created Lawrence, an eight-piece soul-pop band comprised of powerhouse musicians who happen to be their best friends from childhood and college. The keyboard-driven rhythm section and tight, energetic horns create dynamic arrangements to support Clyde and Gracie\u2019s explosive lead vocals and catchy melodies.\n\nTheir sophomore album, aptly titled Living Room, was released in September 2018. Living Room promptly reached #2 on the iTunes R&B/Soul chart, earned a featured placement on Spotify\u2019s \u201cNew Music Friday\u201d playlist, and led the band to its late-night television debut on NBC\u2019s Last Call with Carson Daly. The album ranges from R&B/funk feel-good pop songs to soulful and cinematic ballads. Co-produced by bandmates Jordan Cohen (tenor/baritone saxophone) and Jonny Koh (guitar), Brooklyn-based producer Eli Crews, and Clyde and Gracie themselves, Living Room chronicles the life of two kids growing up into (almost) fully formed humans and the trials and tribulations along the way, including break-ups, make-ups, a family loss, and the attempt to find harmony between excitement, anxiety, melancholy, and empowerment. Sonically, the album combines elements of Lawrence\u2019s old and new influences by mixing live with electronic, analog with digital, and meticulousness with spontaneity.\n\nUpon releasing Living Room, Lawrence embarked on the Living Room World Tour, including a full set of headline dates across North America and support and festival slots across Europe. With their high-energy sound and completely live arrangements, they have gained a devoted following of all ages, demographics, and musical backgrounds. Lawrence has sold out headline shows across the country and appeared at festivals including Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, Firefly, Okeechobee, Hangout, and many more. The band has also opened for notable acts such as Lake Street Dive, Vulfpeck, Jon Bellion, Soulive, Jacob Collier, Blues Traveler, O.A.R, Bernhoft, and others.\n\nLawrence rose to prominence in 2016 when they released their debut LP Breakfast (2016), which reached #6 on the iTunes R&B/Soul charts, and received attention and praise from a variety of sources ranging from NPR\u2019s All Things Considered to Stephen Curry\u2019s social media. Produced by Grammy Award winner Eric Krasno (Lettuce/Tedeschi Trucks/Soulive), Breakfast includes guest performances by NYC soul/funk mainstays Adam Deitch (Lettuce), Cory Henry (Snarky Puppy), and Maurice \u201cMobetta\u201d Brown (Tedeschi Trucks Band).\n\nIn addition to the band, Clyde and Gracie Lawrence also work in other artistic fields.

Sarah Peacock bridges gaps between Country, Blues, Americana, and Rock-N-Roll. Her music is raw and truth telling, sometimes with kindness, sometimes with a dark side, but always fiercely unique. Essentially, at all times, Peacock is victoriously defeating the forces of evil with glorious Amazonian strength, passion, and determination.\n\nHeld hostage by a record label at 21, the troubadour life came with a rude awakening for the young Georgia native. Peacock made her home in a \u201892 Volvo with her dog and a guitar, and for nearly seven years earned a living in the corner shadows of American dive bars.\n\nThe tables turned in 2011 when an anonymous fan helped her buy out her recording contract. Since then she has released six albums, winning multiple awards for her songwriting. \u201cHurricane\u201d won Best Song in the American Songwriting Awards, and \u201cBeautiful\u201d was a winner with International Unsigned Only. \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d and \u201cAre We There Yet\u201d have nominated her for Best Female Artist and Best Song in a number of songwriting competitions. Peacock was also named Listening Room Network\u2019s Artist of the Year.\n\nBut the dark side takes another swing. And, big Nashville promises are especially good at grave digging. From RCA Studio A golden child to street orphan practically overnight, Peacock was ghosted by her entire team and producer without explanation. Spirits crushed, she hit the road. Solo. Again. That was the catalyst that launched her next album, \u201cDream On,\u201d and landed Sarah her first tour bus. But less than 4 months later, she was watching it burn to the ground at a California truck stop. Sarah\u2019s fans quickly came to the rescue with a fundraiser, which is what kept her on the road. That special connection between Sarah and her fans is what put her in Hank Williams Jr.\u2019s former tour bus, one year after the devastating loss. \u201cYou have to be unstoppable, even when you don\u2019t believe you are.\u201d That\u2019s the Modus Operandi for the now half Tennessean, half Texan road warrior.\n\nWhen she\u2019s off the road, Peacock is active in the anti-bullying and animal rescue communities. She helped start a rock school for kids and recently formed her own 501(c)3, The Band Waggin,\u2019 benefiting animal health and rescue programs.\n\nIn 2017, she signed with In Tune Entertainment and American Roots Records. Peacock is sponsored by Taylor Guitars, Fender, 1964 Audio, Strymon, and Mississippi Cold Drip Coffee. Her upcoming EP, \u201cHot Sheet Motel,\u201d is a collection of 5 songs that reveal the secrets of one woman\u2019s journey through the shadows.\n\n\u201cSarah Peacock has a voice that\u2019s a force of nature, at times soft and nuanced and occasionally rafter-rattling powerful. \u201d\n\u2014 Sam Gazdziak (Engine 145)", "otherInfo": "Sarah Peacock - Album Release Show at The Lost Church"}, {"Address": "17 Broadway Blvd, Fairfax, CA 94930", "Artist": "Scott Guberman", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8809008.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.587997, 37.986787], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Rock, Rock, Beyond, Roll", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "19 Broadway", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Guberman performs regularly with Grateful Dead's founding bassist, Phil Lesh.\n\nScott Guberman has become an outstandingly important member of the Bay Area music scene in between his shows with Phil Lesh, appearing most often at Terrapin Crossroads.

CUBE was born in the summer of the 2011 when, during the recording of their debut LP, the band decided to change the name with a name that it rappresent in a better way the sounds of the 9 songs that they were recording. The sound that CUBE proposes is new-thrash death of the 90s but revisited in a modern way influenced by new metal. The band has recorded his debut LP at Flameout Studio and it contains 8 CUBE's tracks and a song originally recorded by NAPALM DEATH (\u201cBreed to Breathe\u201d). The title of this album is \"Napalm for Breakfast\". it's self-product and is available from January 2013. In \u201cNFB\u201d the components were JESTER (voice), BRAS (guitars), KKTZ (bass) and ALEX (drums). All the members have more then ten years of experience and they played in important bands of the underground of the north-est Italy (Zero SIgnal, Ensoph, Bleed in Vain). To promote in a better way this work, CUBE records a video clip of the track \"I'm just a drunkard\". At the end of the 2014 spring KKTZ and JESTER decided to leave the band. BRAS and ALEX didn\u2019t loose time, so ZABI (bass \u2013 ex Soulpit) and MIKE (voice) become part of the band: the structure of the Cube is recomposed and enhanced. At the end of July the band entered in studio to record the new single \u201cNo Disguise\u201d to show to the world, as screamed in the first verse, the new face of the Cube. The band is promoting in live gigs and is preparing new tracks. Il progetto CUBE \u00e8 la naturale evoluzione dovuta a qualche cambio di line up di una precedente band (Wrong). CUBE nasce nell'estate 2011 quando, durante la registrazione dei brani del debut LP, la band decide di darsi un nome che rappresenti maggiormente il sound dei 9 brani presentati da questo combo. Il sound proposto da Cube \u00e8 un NEW THRASH DEATH anni 90 ma rivisto e modernizzato da influenze NEW METAL. La band ha all'attivo un LP autoprodotto registrato presso i Flameout Studio nel quale sono registrati 8 brani inediti e una cover della band inglese Napalm Death (\u201cBreed to Breathe\u201d). Titolo di questo lavoro \u00e8 \u201cNAPALM FOR BREAKFAST\u201d presentato a fine gennaio 2013. CUBE \u00e8 composto in questo EP da JESTER (voce), BRAS (chitarra), KKTZ (basso) ed ALEX (batteria); tutti i componenti hanno decennale esperienza musicale (Live e Studio) e facevano parte di importanti metal band dell'Underground Veneto (Zero Signal, Bleed in Vain, Ensoph). Per promuovere maggiormente CUBE \u00e8 stato realizzato nel mese di dicembre 2013 il video clip del brano intitolato \u201cI\u2019m Just a Drunkard\u201d. Al termine della primavera 2014 KKTZ e JESTER decidono di lasciare la band per motivi personali. BRAS e ALEX non perdono tempo e trovano immediatamente ZABI (basso \u2013 ex Soulpit) e MIKE (voce) che ricompongono e rafforzano la strutturadel cubo. Con questa nuova line up entrano in studio a fine Luglio 2014 per registrare il singolo intitolato \u201cNo Disguise\u201d per presentare al mondo, come cantato nel primo verso della canzone, la nuova faccia del cubo.

Despite dramatic lineup changes, a vast array of influences, and a rebellious attitude Modestep remains both a hot name in EDM and an authentic producer of fun, interesting tracks. Modestep's debut album \"Evolution Theory\" made a big splash and gave the band momentum to basically quit day jobs and live on the road, while their follow up \"London Road\" had a completely different sound and displayed influences of emo, garage, and reggae rock along with standard EMB subgenres like jungle.

In an era where it is challenging for original music to gain and keep people\u2019s attention, this singer/songwriter breaks through the ubiquitous white noise that crowds the musical landscape. Audiences willingly submit to her infinite energy and fiery passion while they are captivated by her hypnotic vocals. Take some Tina Turner, add a dash of Rage Against the Machine, along with a sprinkling of Alanis Morissette, and you have the perfect combination of Rock and Roll and Motown personified by Steff Chris.\n\nA native of Detroit, Michigan, Steffanie is a natural born singer who was blessed to begin performing at local events around the city while she was a young child. At age nine, Steffanie secured her first professional gig as a paid performer at boxing legend, Tommy Hearns\u2019 birthday party. Her Detroit roots have cultivated her music; giving birth to collaborations with local legends like, Big Proof from D12 and J Dilla\u2019s original producing partner, Amp Fiddler.\n\nSteffanie was 18 years old when she explored the concrete jungle of New York City. After signing to Famous Music Publishing, she spent a few years writing with some of the industry\u2019s top songwriters and producers. Yet, Steffanie yearned to fulfill her creative destiny by expressing her own unique musical talent. She returned home to Detroit and immediately reconnected with fellow artists who were close to her heart, including Big Proof.\n\nWith an unwavering work ethic, Steffanie has performed at hundreds of events. A popular staple in poet, jessica Care moore\u2019s Black Women Rock collaborative, she is also the former front woman of the rock band, FluxPhonic. As a solo performer, she has toured with regional funk and soul bands and has opened for a diverse range of acclaimed artists including Tom Morello, Thousand Foot Krutch, Erykah Badu and Talib Kweli. Her highly anticipated debut album, Way Too Much was released in 2014. It was a fitting reflection of her signature style.\n\nIn 2015, Steffanie toured nationwide with Talib Kweli and internationally with the Sisters, Songwriters and Sirens tour created by the Black Rock Coalition, a New York based artists\u2019 collective and non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the creative freedom and works of black musicians.\n\nDedicated to honing her craft, Steffanie became a full-time artist in 2016, after leaving her 9-5 job as a Marketing Coordinator. This year represented an evolution for her as she toured with seminal acts such as, Taylor Mac and worked on her second album, It\u2019s Complicated. Featured in Mac\u2019s A 24-Decade History of Popular Music, Steffanie contributed to what The New York Times deemed as one of \u201cthe best performances of 2016.\u201d\n\nSteffanie\u2019s recent sold out tribute concert to rock icon Tina Turner, Nice and Rough: A Night with Steffanie and Tina was a dynamic display of her bold artistry.

He has said that he is of Choctaw descent, and he was born in a region originally inhabited by the Choctaw. However, in a 2005 interview[citation needed], he said his mother had told him he was actually Cherokee.\n\nHis family considered it normal to play music, with his father playing guitar and harmonica, his mother playing piano, and a relative who was a one-man band. At the age of three, Musselwhite moved to Memphis, Tennessee. When he was a teenager, Memphis experienced the period when rockabilly, western swing, electric blues, and some forms of African American music were combining to give birth to rock and roll. The period featured legendary figures such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, as well as minor legends such as Gus Cannon, Furry Lewis, Will Shade, Royal Bell, Memphis Willie B., Johnny Burnette, Red Roby, Abe McNeal, and Slim Rhodes. Musselwhite supported himself by digging ditches, laying concrete and running moonshine in a 1950 Lincoln. This environment was Musselwhite's school for music as well as life, and he acquired the nickname \"Memphis Charlie.\"[citation needed]\nIn true bluesman fashion, Musselwhite then took off in search of the rumored \"big-paying factory jobs\" up the \"Hillbilly Highway\", legendary Highway 51 to Chicago, where he continued his education on the South Side, making the acquaintance of even more legends including Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Sonny Boy Williamson, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Big Walter Horton. Musselwhite immersed himself completely in the musical life, living in the basement of, and occasionally working at Jazz Record Mart (the record store operated by Delmark Records founder Bob Koester) with Big Joe Williams and working as a driver for an exterminator, which allowed him to observe what was happening around the city's clubs and bars. He spent his time hanging out at the Jazz Record Mart at the corner of State and Grand and the nearby bar, Mr. Joe's, with the city's blues musicians, and sitting in with Big Joe Williams and others in the clubs, playing for tips. There he forged a lifelong friendship with John Lee Hooker; though Hooker lived in Detroit, Michigan, the two often visiting each other, and Hooker serving as best man at Musselwhite's wedding. Gradually Musselwhite became well known around town.\n\nIn time, Musselwhite led his own blues band, and, after Elektra Records' success with Paul Butterfield, he released the classic[citation needed] Stand Back! album in 1966 on Vanguard Records (as \"Charley Musselwhite\"), to immediate and great success. He took advantage of the clout this album gave him to move to San Francisco, where, instead of being one of many competing blues acts, he held court as the king of the blues in the exploding countercultural music scene, an exotic and gritty figure to the flower children. Musselwhite even convinced Hooker to move out to California.\n\nSince then, Musselwhite has released over 20 albums, as well as guesting on albums by many other musicians, such as Bonnie Raitt's Longing in Their Hearts and The Blind Boys of Alabama's Spirit of the Century, both winners of Grammy awards. He also appeared on Tom Waits' Mule Variations and INXS' Suicide Blonde. He himself has won 14 W. C. Handy awards and six Grammy nominations, as well as Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Monterey Blues Festival and the San Javier Jazz Festival in San Javier, Spain, and the Mississippi Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts.\n\nIn 1979, Musselwhite recorded The Harmonica According to Charlie Musselwhite in London for Kicking Mule Records, intended to go with an instructional book; the album itself became so popular that it has been released on CD.\n\nUnfortunately, Musselwhite, as with many of his peers, fell victim to alcoholism; by his own admission[citation needed], he had never been on stage sober until after he stopped drinking entirely in 1987.\n\nIn 1990 Musselwhite signed with Alligator Records, a step led to a resurgence of his career.\n\nOver the years, Musselwhite has branched out in style. His 1999 recording, Continental Drifter, is accompanied by Quarteto Patria, from Cuba's Santiago region, the Cuban music analog of the Mississippi Delta. Because of the political differences between Cuba and the United States, the album was recorded in Bergen, Norway, with Musselwhite's wife ironing out all the details.\n\nMusselwhite believes the key to his musical success was finding a style where he could express himself. He has said, \"I only know one tune, and I play it faster or slower, or I change the key, but it\u2019s just the one tune I\u2019ve ever played in my life. It\u2019s all I know.\"[1]\n\nHis past two albums, Sanctuary and Delta Hardware have both been released on Real World Records.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2925 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Soul Funky", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.417909, 37.764929], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Slate Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Soul Funky\" w/ resident DJ Kevin Garcia"}, {"Address": "924 Gilman St, Berkeley, CA 94706", "Artist": "Skunk Funk", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9037138.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299296, 37.879505], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Funk, Hip Hop, Ska Punk, Reggae", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "924 Gilman", "moreBioInfo": "Eclectic, funky and pure irie, Skunk Funk sprung up from the streets of Vallejo, California to bring every crowd they woo an inspiringly animated experience.

What remains to be seen is where they get their influences, which can range anywhere from Sublime, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Primus to Mac Dre, Fishbone and Bob Marley. What the band\u2019s members see, feel and experience, transcends into the crowd in such a way that every event they are given the opportunity to perform is sure to be an amazing musical and party atmosphere. Over the course of the last 4 years with their established line-up, they have managed to independently release an EP entitled \u201cToo Fresh to Function\u201d and a full-length album entitled \u201cPossession 4 Sale\u201d. August 17th, 2018 they released a 2 song EP based around the single and music video \"Cirque Du Skank\". They plan on recording and performing live in 2019.\n\nSkunk Funk\u2019s diverse sound and energetic live shows has earned them chances to perform at numerous venues including the 924 Gilman (Berkeley), the Cow Palace (SF), Smiley\u2019s Schooner Saloon (Bolinas), The NOS event center (San Bernardino), The Blue Lamp (Sacramento) breweries like Napa Smith Brewery (Vallejo), theater venues like the Assembly in Sacramento and Blue Note (Napa), underground punk rock venues like the Burnt Ramen (Richmond) to Napa Valley wineries such as Stag\u2019s Leap Winery (Napa). No matter the event, they connect with any crowd in any setting. They\u2019ve had the pleasure to play numerous festivals such as Bottle Rock Napa Valley, Chalice Festival, Hemp Con, Heart and Soulstice Festival, Reggae in the Trees (OR), Sacramento Hemp Fest and more. In their travels they have shared the stage with many different acts including The Black Keys, Zac Brown Band, Primus, Violent Femmes, Joan Jett, Cake, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Train, Michael Franti, Bad Religion, The Black Crowes, The Flaming Lips, The Aggrolites, RBL Posse,Indubious, Mystic Roots, Prezident Brown, Marlon Asher, Baby Bash, Paul Wall, Fortunate Youth, Yukmouth, B-Legit and many more to come in the near future.\n\nWith dynamism and music like theirs, your party, show, event, wedding, concert, anything is sure to be a hit and full of the most positive, high energy and groove filled tunes.

He is the older brother of Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\nJimmie Vaughan's style was influenced by Freddie King who gave him personal advice. Also two other blues guitarists, Albert King and B. B. King, were important influences. Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson was another important early influence (Jimmie says that he and his younger brother Stevie studied Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson more than any other single guitarist).\n\nJimmie Vaughan developed his own personal style that is easily recognized. He formed the band The Fabulous Thunderbirds with singer and harpist Kim Wilson, bassist Keith Fergusson, and drummer Mike Buck. (The initial Fabulous Thunderbirds members were all proteges of Austin, Texas blues club owner, Clifford Antone.) The band's first four albums, released between 1979 and 1983, are ranked among the most important 'white blues' recordings. Sadly, since those early albums did not sell well, the band was left out without a recording contract for a couple of years (during the times when Jimmie's younger brother achieved popular success).\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds got a new contract in 1986 and made several albums that featured more commercial pop-music sound and production styles. Jimmie left the band in 1989 and made a \"duo album\" called Family Style with his younger brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Before the album was released, Stevie died in a helicopter crash in Wisconsin on August 27, 1990. The album was released a few days after the tragic accident (the listed artist on the album was \"Vaughan Brothers\"). The album was light blues-influenced rock with Jimmie singing on several tracks.\n\nVaughan released his first solo album Strange Pleasure in 1994. The album contained a song \"Six Strings Down\" that was dedicated to the memory of his brother. He has continued his solo career since then. Vaughan's solo albums contain mostly blues-rock material that he writes himself.\n\nIn 2001, Vaughan paid an installment on his (and the Fabulous Thunderbirds') huge debt to harmonica swamp blues when he contributed guitar to the Lazy Lester album Blues Stop Knockin'.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "The Jacks (US)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8010304.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Rock n Roll", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "THE JACKS\n\nJonny Stanback (lead vocals/rhythm guitar)\nTom Hunter (lead guitar, vocals)\nScott Stone (bass guitar, vocals)\nJosh Roossin (drums/percussion)\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to playing rock & roll with a heavy influence from the British Invasion of the \u201860s and \u201870s mixed with Southern Rock, The Jacks simply don't have a choice. \"It's what we listen to, it's what we play,\" bassist Scott Stone says, \"and when you stick four guys like us in a garage with instruments, it's just the kind of music we are going to make.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to push the boundaries of the rock & roll genre by incorporating modern elements, but still keeping the core structure of a four-piece band,\u201d Stanback says. \u201cWe are creating a sound that feels familiar, but is completely ours.\u201d\n\nThe way they see it, playing rock at a time when pop and hip-hop are dominating the charts is an act of defiance. If any band is poised to help bring authenticity back to rock & roll, it's The Jacks. The quartet has been making a steady ascent since forming in Los Angeles in the summer of 2016, selling out gigs at legendary hometown venues like the Troubadour, Roxy and Viper Room, and playing big festivals like Aftershock and Sonic Temple.\n\nThe Jacks got their name from a fan telling them early on that they were \"jacks of all trades\" when it came to playing different styles and blending their songs with those of their idols. They often performed four-hour shows covering songs from almost every era to make money to pay for their early recordings. Each of their tracks shows off a different side of the ensemble. From the hard-edged rockers to the more melodic numbers, you can hear how the band members have poured their hearts into each of the songs.\n\nAfter relentless gigging and self-releasing singles, the band entered a local radio station\u2019s battle-of-the-bands competition in 2017 \u2013 and won a recording contract. They passed on the offer and continued to tour and work on their songs waiting for the right opportunity. They found that opportunity when EDGEOUT Records signed them and put them in the studio with producer Matt Wallace (Maroon 5, Faith No More). The group released their debut self-titled EP with EDGEOUT / UME after working with Wallace at Los Angeles' famed Sunset Sound Recorders.\n\nAs Wallace declares, \u201cThe Jacks deliver lean, rugged rock & roll with songs that feel like instant classics that make you want to move, with earworm hooks and melodies that will have you kinda upset when you find yourself unintentionally and inappropriately humming their songs at work, in church, in court, or at wakes. If the Strokes, Cage the Elephant, and the Stones had an equally talented, but more handsome baby, it would be named The Jacks!\u201d\n\nWhile their self-titled debut EP and first single, \u201cWalk Away,\u201d racked up almost three million streams and the release of a reimagined version of the holiday classic, \u201cIn The Bleak Midwinter,\u201d cleared almost a million streams, the band spent much of the past year on the road touring including a West Coast run with The Shelters, and a nationwide tour supporting \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d finalist Wade Cota. They also performed at the NFL pre-Super Bowl and NHL Winter Classic events, and \u201cWalk Away\u201d was chosen to be heard during the 2019 Stanley Cup playoff games\u2019 broadcasts, highlight reels, and commercial bumpers.In spite of their rigorous touring The Jacks somehow made time to spend time in the studio creating new music.\n\nFor The Jacks\u2019 second EP REMEMBER YOU, multiple GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli (The Raconteurs, Weezer, Frank Zappa) was at the helm. The band once again delivers original songs infused with their passion for guitar-driven, groove-propulsive rock \u2018n\u2019 roll that is sung with sassy grit (\u201cThrew It All Away\u201d), heartfelt angst (\u201cWe Were Only Young\u201d) and emotion (\u201cOlivia\u201d), or soaring anticipation (\u201cThe Only One\u201d).", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Reid Genauer", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9918137.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Rock, Jam Rock, Indie Folk, Americana, Psychedelic Rock, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "Reid Genauer is best known in his role as lead singer, songwriter, storyteller in Assembly of Dust and Strangefolk.

Known as an inspiration to Jimi Hendrix and other 1960s blues and rock legends, Guy is considered as an imporant proponent of Chicago blues made famous by Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. He has influenced both widely known and local blues guitarists.\n\nGuy is known for his showmanship; for example, he plays with drumsticks and walks into the audience whilst playing, the latter being a gimmick he picked up from a local blues guitarist at an early age (joining or leaping into the audience has also long been common in both American popular and gospel music, as in the earlier work of Big Jay McNeely or the Dixie Hummingbirds).\n\nGuy grew up in Louisiana where he learned to play guitar. In the early 1950s he began performing with bands in Baton Rouge. Soon after moving to Chicago in 1957, Guy fell under the influence of \"Mighty\" Muddy Waters. In 1958 he won a record contract with Artistic Records after beating the West Side guitarists Magic Sam and Otis Rush in a \"Head Cutting Contest\" at the Blue Flame Club. Soon afterwards he recorded for the Cobra label.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Guy was a session guitarist for Chess Records. He recorded on Junior Wells sessions for Delmark Records under the pseudonym Friendly Chap in 1965 and 1966. His career took off during a blues revival period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was sparked by Eric Clapton's request that Guy be part of the '24 nights' all-star blues guitar lineup at London's Royal Albert Hall and Guy's subsequent signing with Silvertone Records.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Walnut Creek, CA", "Artist": "Sarah Peacock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9226807.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.065, 37.9063], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Country Rock, singer-songwriter, Roots Rock, Acoustic", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Private Event", "moreBioInfo": "If you think Wonder Woman is a badass, you\u2019ll definitely want to meet Sarah Peacock. 1.2 million miles, 2,800 shows, and fourteen years of nonstop crushing it while flying solo is one heck of a road trip. Sarah Peacock bridges gaps between Country, Blues, Americana, and Rock-N-Roll. Her music is raw and truth telling, sometimes with kindness, sometimes with a dark side, but always fiercely unique. Essentially, at all times, Peacock is victoriously defeating the forces of evil with glorious Amazonian strength, passion, and determination.\n\nHeld hostage by a record label at 21, the troubadour life came with a rude awakening for the young Georgia native. Peacock made her home in a \u201892 Volvo with her dog and a guitar, and for nearly seven years earned a living in the corner shadows of American dive bars.\n\nThe tables turned in 2011 when an anonymous fan helped her buy out her recording contract. Since then she has released six albums, winning multiple awards for her songwriting. \u201cHurricane\u201d won Best Song in the American Songwriting Awards, and \u201cBeautiful\u201d was a winner with International Unsigned Only. \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d and \u201cAre We There Yet\u201d have nominated her for Best Female Artist and Best Song in a number of songwriting competitions. Peacock was also named Listening Room Network\u2019s Artist of the Year.\n\nBut the dark side takes another swing. And, big Nashville promises are especially good at grave digging. From RCA Studio A golden child to street orphan practically overnight, Peacock was ghosted by her entire team and producer without explanation. Spirits crushed, she hit the road. Solo. Again. That was the catalyst that launched her next album, \u201cDream On,\u201d and landed Sarah her first tour bus. But less than 4 months later, she was watching it burn to the ground at a California truck stop. Sarah\u2019s fans quickly came to the rescue with a fundraiser, which is what kept her on the road. That special connection between Sarah and her fans is what put her in Hank Williams Jr.\u2019s former tour bus, one year after the devastating loss. \u201cYou have to be unstoppable, even when you don\u2019t believe you are.\u201d That\u2019s the Modus Operandi for the now half Tennessean, half Texan road warrior.\n\nWhen she\u2019s off the road, Peacock is active in the anti-bullying and animal rescue communities. She helped start a rock school for kids and recently formed her own 501(c)3, The Band Waggin,\u2019 benefiting animal health and rescue programs.\n\nIn 2017, she signed with In Tune Entertainment and American Roots Records. Peacock is sponsored by Taylor Guitars, Fender, 1964 Audio, Strymon, and Mississippi Cold Drip Coffee. Her upcoming EP, \u201cHot Sheet Motel,\u201d is a collection of 5 songs that reveal the secrets of one woman\u2019s journey through the shadows.\n\n\u201cSarah Peacock has a voice that\u2019s a force of nature, at times soft and nuanced and occasionally rafter-rattling powerful. \u201d\n\u2014 Sam Gazdziak (Engine 145)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1807 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Guapdad 4000", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9514605.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Rap", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Fox Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Pepper", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9088364.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Dub, Ska, Kona Dub ROCK, Rock, Reggae Rock, Reggae", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Cornerstone Craft Beer & Live Music", "moreBioInfo": "We are a 3 piece band from Kailua-Kona, HI.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "8915 MacArthur Blvd, Oakland, CA 94605", "Artist": "Desolation Row (CA)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10223433.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.16172, 37.75626], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Metalcore, Punk, Metal, Melodic Hardcore", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Savage People HQ", "moreBioInfo": "SF Metal/Punk/Hardcore-influenced something or other", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4444 Railroad Ave, Pleasanton, CA 94566", "Artist": "Sideline", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9372310.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.873553, 37.661082], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Firehouse Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "Sideline is a pedigreed six-piece powerhouse whose style has set the pace in Bluegrass for over two decades.

This album follows their 2009 studio release, Pacific Dust, and a four-disc retrospective compilation, Days of Sun and Grass, both of which garnered critical praise from outlets including The New Yorker, Mojo, Relix, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and cemented the band's reputation as creators of \"California Soul.\" Co-founded by principal songwriter/lead vocalist Tim Bluhm and guitarist/vocalist Greg Loiacono, the Mother Hips has spawned its own community and even its own rock festival, Hipnic. Held at Big Sur, Hipnic is now in its fifth year and has featured like-minded California bands including Cass McCombs, Jackie Greene, Al Jardine, Neal Casal, Dawes and others.\n\nIt's been a long, winding journey since their 1993 debut on Rick Rubin's American Recordings, Back to the Grotto, through to the present day, which finds them in full charge of their own careers. Through it all, the Mother Hips are self-sustaining and, 20 years in, continue to operate as a cottage industry. The band also has its own beer and its own wine.\n\nBehind Beyond, recorded over the past year at Mission Bells Studio in San Francisco with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, finds Bluhm wading cautiously into midlife, exploring thoughts of mortality as if it were a hazy dream. Loiacono, the man behind the many instrumental passages that weave through the album, says that this album \"stretches out a lot more than any of our other records.\" There's a sense of ease with these songs, from the laid-back feel of \"Isle Not of Man\" to the psychedelic guitar interplay of \"Jefferson Army.\"\n\n\nBluhm is the tall, rugged, frontman that pulls the listener in while Loiacono is the compact, explosive guitar ace that drives the music. But it's their partnership -- the unique, almost brotherly way they sing and play together -- that defines the band.\n\nWhen asked what makes this album special, the two bandleaders come at it from a different angle. Loiacono references the second track, \"Freed From A Prison,\" a song he wrote but that Bluhm sings, citing the ability to let go of the song that made it work. \"That song is about the concept of being freed from a prison you didn't even know you were in,\" he says. \"It's this idea of finally opening up to an experience that was there for you the whole time. To me, a lot of this album is like that.\"\n\nBluhm says that making the music meaningful -- going beyond just having a solid, well-played tune -- is the most important thing for him. \"It's about making creative choices that are unconventional but that are still appealing that hopefully can reach the listener in a way they didn't expect and affect parts of their heart and mind they didn't expect to be affected by rock music, he says. I'm trying to make music that has a spiritual aspect where it's more than just a good song and more than just a rocking band or a commodity, an emotional experience that you might not even know is happening because it's surrounded by a loud rock band.\"\n\nIt all started in 1990 at California State University in Chico when Bluhm and Loaicano found themselves living in the same house, teaching each other guitar chords and experimenting with harmony. They didn't realize it but they were laying the foundation for a sound, a style and a partnership that would last their entire lives. The Hips were signed to Rick Rubin's American Recordings while still in college and released their debut in 1993, followed by 1995's Part Timer Goes Full and 1996's Shootout. The band found themselves swept up into the life of major label touring, along with the heavy partying and relentless grind that has destroyed countless bands. Little promotion from the label found the Hips self-releasing 1998's Later Days and regrouping as a band.\n\nSince then, they've gone on to release independent studio albums (Green Hills of Earth, Kiss The Crystal Flake, and Pacific Dust) and have cultivated one of the most rabid and loyal fan bases in rock today. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, the Hips returned from a four-year hiatus (2001 - 2005) to find that they were more popular than ever. The core line-up of the band has remained stable since 2004, Bluhm, Loiaconco and drummer John Hofer. In 2011, Paul Hoaglin left the band and Frank Zappa and Fear bassist Scott Thunes joined the Hips. These days, the Mother Hips have changed their approach to touring, playing 80 shows a year rather than hundreds, concentrating on well-defined tour markets rather than staying out for long hauls.\n\nToday the Hips are free; they make their own schedule, recording and touring when it feels right. They're a successful independent business as well, having built up a loyal following and community for their sound and gaining the respect of their peers and critics along the way.

Born in London, England, Allison has played music for most of his life, but really began focusing his skills when he opened a recording studio, Electraplay, in Columbus, Ohio. At Electraplay, Allison produced various projects including the Donewaiting.com series, \u201cLive at Electraplay,\u201d with touring acts such as Phantogram, Maps and Atlases, and Ezra Furman. Electraplay quickly built a reputation as a hub for the Columbus music scene to make records, and that gave Allison the opportunity to collaborate with a wealth of talent. He produced and performed with multiple acts in genres ranging from electronicore to soul, and opened for acts like Weezer, Crystal Castles J Roddy Walston & the Business. While reaching various levels of success with other bands, Allison started to get the itch to step out of a complimentary role and start his own project. Digisaurus was born.\n\nWith a sound somewhere between the lines of Chromeo, Daft Punk, and Nine Inch Nails, Digisaurus produced his first EP, \u201cNo More Room For Love,\u201d with Michael Landolt (Maroon 5, Michael Franti) which included breakthrough single \u201cWithout Me\u201d (currently at over 300,000 streams) in 2015.\n\nThe EP was well received and helped Digi secure spots in lineups at CMJ, CD102.5\u2019s Summerfest and the first of two Daytrotter sessions.\n\nFollowing a quick start, Digisaurus had to plan the next phase of his musical evolution. He became frustrated by the lack of performance opportunities at home and found the new path to fame for an independent artist in the music industry expensive, unsustainable, and sociopathic. Digi wanted to improve as a performer and found inspiration in the story of the Beatles humble beginnings in Hamburg (in which they played five hour gigs, seven nights a week, for two years). So he closed his studio, bought a van, and hit the road.\n\nDigisaurus has played over 400 shows in the past two years at dives, houses, coffee shops, breweries, wineries...wherever would have him to hone his skills as a performer. His progress has been reciprocated in 2018 with club gigs and festival appearances alongside acts like tuneYards, Parquet Courts, Joywave, and Japanese Breakfast.

He left Van Halen at the pinnacle of his tenure with them in 1985 (being replaced by Montrose's Sammy Hagar) and formed a solo band. After some time spent performing lounge jazz to small audiences, Roth recruited a super group of Steve Vai (guitar), Billy Sheehan (bass) and Greg Bisonette (drums), and released the wildly successful 'Eat 'em and Smile' album in 1986. For a while, Roth's success equaled that of his own band; but while Van Halen became huge with Hagar behind the mic, DLR's star faded over time. After the impressive dream-team line-up of the David Lee Roth band imploded due to ego, guitar prodigy Jason Becker (formerly of Cacophony) was bought into the fold in 1989. Sadly, Becker contracted Lou Gehrig's Disease (a form of paralysis) and can no longer play, having only performed on one DLR album A Little Ain't Enough (1991). Since then, Roth has employed a revolving line-up of musicians, and has never risen back to his former level of success.\n\nIn 2007, David Lee Roth rejoined Van Halen for a semi-reunion with the Van Halen brothers, along with Eddie Van Halen's son (Wolfgang Van Halen) on bass (replacing Michael Anthony from the original lineup).", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Benefits", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Friends with Benefits w/ Miles Medina, Jazzy Jim"}, {"Address": "155 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Gaucho", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7519822.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.405592, 37.796778], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Acoustic, Swing", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Comstock Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "Gaucho is a masterful Bay Area band that combines the influence of gypsy jazz of 1930\u2019s Europe with the rhythmic drive and collective improvisation of New Orleans swing music, gutbucket blues and elements of ragtime.

Named after an ancient Celtic harvest festival in honour of the Irish god Lugh, the group that Folk Roots magazine once called an \u201cIrish music dream team\u201d was formed from members of some of Ireland\u2019s greatest bands and over the years has proven its mettle time and again, having sold over a quarter of a million records, performed more than 2,000 shows in high-profile concert venues across 36 countries, and collaborated with many notable artists outside the tradition. Two decades ago they ascended to the forefront of contemporary Irish music, and there they\u2019ve remained, a leading voice in the genre and the standard against which others are compared.\nThe seeds were sown in 1996, when all-Ireland fiddle champion Se\u00e1n Smyth (Donal Lunny\u2019s Coolfin), bassist Trevor Hutchinson (The Waterboys) and guitarist Donogh Hennessy (Sharon Shannon Band) embarked on a series of trio gigs in Scandinavia. Together, they began to develop a new sound that they sensed had incredible promise. Upon returning home to Ireland, they invited flute player Michael McGoldrick (Flook, Toss the Feathers) and uilleann piper John McSherry (Coolfin) in to add sonic depth. A tour of Ireland as \u201cSe\u00e1n Smyth and Friends\u201d followed that yielded a series of live recordings that would become the basis of their critically acclaimed eponymous CD debut.\n1997 was the pivotal year. It began with a tour of Australia, the first under the L\u00fanasa flag, which included virtuoso flute player Kevin Crawford (Moving Cloud) as a temporary stand-in for McGoldrick. Hennessy recalled how the band \u201cwent down a bomb\u201d there, a feeling the Sydney Morning Herald echoed when it marveled at the group\u2019s live energy and how excitement for their heavy, rhythmic sound \u201c[sent] shock waves through the audience.\u201d These tours cemented the band\u2019s musical approach and established their sterling reputation as a live act. But it was the release of L\u00fanasa later that year that put it all together: the album was a fast best-seller, topped Hot Press magazine\u2019s folk charts, and made the band a darling of the traditional music scene. The band\u2019s new musical direction proved fertile artistic ground, indeed.\nL\u00fanasa\u2019s second album Otherworld followed in 1999 and raised their profile further, with New York\u2019s Irish Voice newspaper declaring them \u201cIreland\u2019s newest supergroup\u201d and \u201cthe hottest Irish acoustic band on the planet.\u201d By this time, Crawford had not only become a full time band member, but the group\u2019s live show was attracting significant international attention. The Times of London praised them for demonstrating \u201cthat there is far more to the Celtic tradition than the cliches of Riverdance,\u201d while the South China Morning Post described how the band \u201cget[s] all but the dead up and dancing.\u201d The Japan Times recommended them \u201c[to] any fan of real Celtic music who wants to work up a sweat.\u201d\nThe addition of master uilleann piper and whistle player Cillian Vallely (Riverdance, Bruce Springsteen) in early 1999 galvanized the group\u2019s sound and led to their celebrated third album, The Merry Sisters of Fate (2001). A hit with critics, the album\u2019s strength led MOJO magazine to name the band \"the new gods of Irish music,\u201d adding that \u201cnobody since the Bothies has wielded such a thrilling rhythmic underlay.\u201d Billboard raved that \u201canybody who listens can\u2019t help but find them contagious.\u201d It seemed like the band the Washington Post once said was \u201cdetermined to drag Irish folk music kicking and screaming into the 21st century\u201d had achieved what they set out to do. \u201cEven the final fade promises much,\u201d Roots World wrote. \u201cYou know they're heading into the future, not obscurity.\u201d\nL\u00fanasa\u2019s next two releases, 2003\u2019s Redwood and the 2004 live album The Kinnitty Sessions, continued to deliver on the band\u2019s promise. They toured heavily for both and received much deserved accolades for their efforts. The 2003 Quebec City Summer Festival awarded them with the \"Coup de Coeur Miroir\u201d prize for their performances while The Kinnitty Sessions won Irish Music Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest Traditional Album\u201d award for 2005 and was nominated for \u201cFolk Album Of The Year\u201d at the 2004 BBC Radio 2 Awards. \u201cThe results,\u201d Australia\u2019s Daily Telegraph wrote of The Kinnitty Sessions \u201care a wonderful affirmation of the powers of this band and this tradition.\u201d\nThings changed a bit for the band with their sixth album, S\u00e9. It was the first Hutchinson produced, which gave them an increased measure of control over their sound, but it was also the first without Hennessy, who left shortly before the album was recorded. Instead of finding Hennesy\u2019s replacement right away, they filled the lacunae he left with three guitarists, Tim Edey, Paul Meehan (who stayed on to tour), and Conor Brady, and the results were spectacular. In its review, Hot Press lauded S\u00e9, saying \u201cL\u00fanasa are at that place where the past meets the future,\u201d adding \u201cthey reveal a spirit few of their contemporaries can equal, as they seem to choose from a palette containing a range of sounds and moods not available to more mortal players.\u201d The concert reviews were better than ever, too, with NPR\u2019s All Things Considered hailing the band\u2019s live show, saying \u201cL\u00fanasa's trademarks have always been the subtle rhythmic segues between tunes and the way they ratchet up the intensity during each set of music. [\u2026] There\u2019s real passion in the performances.\u201d\nAfter The Story So Far\u2026, a 2008 \u201cbest of\u201d compilation, the band followed in 2010 with L\u00e1 Nua, their first self-released album since L\u00fanasa. L\u00e1 Nua featured more original compositions than any of the band\u2019s previous albums and was seen as a breath of fresh air, with Sing Out magazine calling it \u201canother ineffable masterpiece\u201d and the Irish Echo newspaper ranking it second on its list of the \"Top Ten Traditional Albums of 2010.\u201d That year, the group also appeared on the opening track of singer-songwriter Natalie Merchant\u2019s Leave Your Sleep, an album the Wall Street Journal called \u201can ideal fit between poetic and musical rhythms.\u201d L\u00fanasa\u2019s contribution to it was roundly praised.\nThen, in, 2013 the band released L\u00fanasa with the RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra, a bold collaboration with the in-house orchestra of Ireland's national broadcaster, RT\u00c9. With a new guitarist Ed Boyd (Flook, Kate Rusby, and Cara Dillon) in the fold and a set of remarkable arrangements written by Niall Vallely, the album \u201c[built] on the group\u2019s immediately recognizable sound and [gave] their music an exciting new dimension\u201d (Irish Echo). Its release led to groundbreaking performances in Ireland, France, and the US that critics called \u201ca successful blend of articulation and raw nerve-end pulse\" (fRoots). While there have been collaborations between orchestral and traditional groups before, none have matched this album\u2019s excitement or intensity.\nIn recent years, L\u00fanasa has continued to tour, dazzling crowds all over the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe. In addition to major collaborations with the likes of legendary singer-songwriter Mary Chapin Carpenter (2015) and bluegrass superstar Tim O\u2019Brien (2016), they\u2019ve introduced star musician Colin Farrell (Project West, Grada) to the band, who has been sharing fiddle duties with Smyth and who brings enormous talent and an innate understanding of the group\u2019s sound.\nLegendary Irish fiddler Kevin Burke once said that \u201cmaintaining the unique, intimate qualities of a musical tradition while at the same time meeting and fulfilling the demands of the contemporary music world is a difficult juxtaposition to achieve, yet L\u00fanasa have managed to accomplish exactly that.\u201d From the start, the band\u2019s complex arrangements and unique sound reshaped the boundaries of traditional music and energized audiences the world over. Twenty years on, the group continues to evolve, playing new music that is as state-of-the-art and aggressively infectious today as it was so long ago. With their new album \"Cas\" realised to great acclaim in 2018 , L\u00fanasa continues to set the standard and will lead the way for decades to come.\n\nwww.lunasa.ie", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "561 1st St, Brentwood, CA 94513", "Artist": "Tony Saunders Bassist & Producer", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8650825.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.693812, 37.931203], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Jam Band And Pop, Gospel, R&B, New-jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Mannheim Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "Two-time Emmy Award Winner Bassist Tony Saunders has released his 3rd CD Uptown Jazz on San Francisco Records.

Born in London, England, Allison has played music for most of his life, but really began focusing his skills when he opened a recording studio, Electraplay, in Columbus, Ohio. At Electraplay, Allison produced various projects including the Donewaiting.com series, \u201cLive at Electraplay,\u201d with touring acts such as Phantogram, Maps and Atlases, and Ezra Furman. Electraplay quickly built a reputation as a hub for the Columbus music scene to make records, and that gave Allison the opportunity to collaborate with a wealth of talent. He produced and performed with multiple acts in genres ranging from electronicore to soul, and opened for acts like Weezer, Crystal Castles J Roddy Walston & the Business. While reaching various levels of success with other bands, Allison started to get the itch to step out of a complimentary role and start his own project. Digisaurus was born.\n\nWith a sound somewhere between the lines of Chromeo, Daft Punk, and Nine Inch Nails, Digisaurus produced his first EP, \u201cNo More Room For Love,\u201d with Michael Landolt (Maroon 5, Michael Franti) which included breakthrough single \u201cWithout Me\u201d (currently at over 300,000 streams) in 2015.\n\nThe EP was well received and helped Digi secure spots in lineups at CMJ, CD102.5\u2019s Summerfest and the first of two Daytrotter sessions.\n\nFollowing a quick start, Digisaurus had to plan the next phase of his musical evolution. He became frustrated by the lack of performance opportunities at home and found the new path to fame for an independent artist in the music industry expensive, unsustainable, and sociopathic. Digi wanted to improve as a performer and found inspiration in the story of the Beatles humble beginnings in Hamburg (in which they played five hour gigs, seven nights a week, for two years). So he closed his studio, bought a van, and hit the road.\n\nDigisaurus has played over 400 shows in the past two years at dives, houses, coffee shops, breweries, wineries...wherever would have him to hone his skills as a performer. His progress has been reciprocated in 2018 with club gigs and festival appearances alongside acts like tuneYards, Parquet Courts, Joywave, and Japanese Breakfast. While touring, Digisaurus continues to release new content through a monthly single series, a weekly blog, and a podcast.

It is a dark, pressing and lively album that reflects on a sense of loss, of time slipping away through your fingers. MTT mixes up influences from Kate Bush, Michael Jackson, The Knife and Portishead and draws inspiration from horror movies, ghost stories blending the otherworldly with universal feelings of anxiety, melancholy and hope. [DUTCH] Na een veelgeprezen debuut komt MTT (voorheen Minus The Tiger) in het voorjaar van 2014 met de opvolger, Years From Now. Het sfeervolle, persoonlijke album is zowel muzikaal als inhoudelijk een spannende stap vooruit. Een intensieve periode waarin onder meer de geboorte van een dochter voor een nieuw perspectief zorgde, krijgt een introspectieve, bij vlagen melancholische invulling. Vrees niet, het album blijft ver uit de buurt van een muzikale versie van het wanhopigere segment van de ingezonden brievenrubriek van de Ouders van Nu. Sterker, MTT heeft een knap, doorleefd en urgent album gemaakt, speciaal voor iedereen die weet hoe het voelt als de tijd je door de vingers glipt. De gloedvolle en wonderlijk geslaagde poging de jaren tachtig te mixen met een actuele sound, zijn een voorlopige kroon op de samenwerking tussen zangeres Anne Broekman, producer Maarten Besseling en drummer Jos Terlingen. Het resultaat sluit nog nadrukkelijker aan bij de internationale ambities die de band met het debuut over de grenzen al op de kaart zette. Met het secuur afgestelde samenspel tussen diepe bassen en vervreemdende sounds ontpopt MTT zich nog meer als \u00e9\u00e9n van de meest verfrissende Nederlandse acts.

A passionate guitarist since middle school, he began his music career in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area upon graduating from TCU.\n\nPlaying in the vibrant Metroplex gospel and R&B scene led Lettieri to join jazz/world group Snarky Puppy in 2008, where he contributes as guitarist, as well as arranger and composer. The group has earned three GRAMMY Awards: Best R&B Performance for \"Something\" feat. Lalah Hathaway in 2014, and twice for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album (Sylva in 2016, and Culcha Vulcha in 2017). Snarky Puppy tours constantly, having performed on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nAside from the Pups, Lettieri has spent time on the road with neo-soul icon Erykah Badu, gospel singer/actress Tamela Mann, and American Idol: Season 11 winner Phillip Phillips. He's also performed with a myriad of other artists, including Anthony Evans, Chrisette Michele, Myron Butler, N'dambi, Bilal, and even Pat Boone.\n\nAn in-demand session guitarist, recent work includes David Crosby, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Adam Levine, Kirk Franklin, Marvin Sapp, Fred Hammond, Ledisi, Anthony Evans, Eric Roberson, Lecrae, Lupe Fiasco, Keyshia Cole, Xzibit, as well as numerous radio and television jingles. Lettieri is also a member of Team SKP, a production collective led by GRAMMY Award-winning producer Symbolyc One (Kanye West, Beyonce).\n\nSince 2010, he has been a member of the house band for the Marcus & Joni Show, a Christian morning talk/variety show broadcast in 200 countries on the Daystar Television Network.\n\nLettieri has released three albums as a leader, Knows in 2011, Futurefun in 2013, and most recently, Spark and Echo in 2016 (Ropeadope Records). Spark and Echo climbed to #11 on Billboard's Jazz Albums Chart, and #2 on iTunes' Jazz Chart. Through tours with Snarky Puppy and social media network shares, these records have created a sizable buzz among fans of instrumental music worldwide. He performs frequently in a trio setting featuring a revolving rhythm section of world-class Dallas musicians, and has begun touring this music in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\n\nFor more information, multimedia, and tour dates, visit: www.marklettieri.com", "otherInfo": "Mark Lettieri: guitar\nUriah Duffy: bass\nDame Drummer: drums"}, {"Address": "1131 N Lawrence Expy, Sunnyvale, CA 94089", "Artist": "Adrian", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/259697.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.996727, 37.3974], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Metal, Heavy Metal", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Parranda Night Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "119 Utah St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "2NITE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.406803, 37.768186], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Great Northern", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "LIMITED TICKETS HAVE BEEN RELEASED!"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Chris", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7559704.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Progressive Rock, Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "Chris was born and raised in Romania.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

At a young age his favorite things to do were going to the Rodeo, listening to country music, singing and playing guitar. Soon enough, Brodie formed and fronted a southern rock band and had the good fortune of touring the country opening up for big artists in front of sold out arenas. His band even charted on Billboard. With his southern rock roots, Brodie returned to what he loved the most, \"country music\". While working on tracks for his own band Brodie also wrote and produced songs for various other artists such as \u201cSweet Isabel\u201d recorded by Enrique Iglesias for his (Interscope Records) Release entitled \u201cInsomniac\u201d. Shortly after placing Sweet Isabel with Enrique, Martin Kierszenbaum (President of Cherrytree/Interscope Records) signed Brodie to a song/production deal to the label. Quickly following, Brodie signed a publishing deal with (Warner Chappell Music Publishing). Since that time Brodie has written and produced several tracks for various artists. Currently 100% of Brodie's attention is on The Brodie Stewart Band's country music endeavor. On his debut album \"Born American\", Brodie teamed up with guitarist/ producer/ songwriter \"Adam Shoenfeld\" (Jason Aldean, Tim Mcgraw, Luke Bryan, Keith Urban, Jake Owen, Big and Rich,Florida Georgia Line and many more..) to co-produce and play on the album along with several top players, including working with one great engineer \"Aaron Chmielewski\" in Nashville.

His warm vocals and authentic writing style combined with a bold grit give Chris James and the Showdowns that classic-infused deep-rooted Americana rock sound. Beginning as a local performer in Portland, Maine, James knew that he had to get his name heard in bigger cities. He left for San Francisco with nothing more than a guitar in hand to find work. Eventually, he joined forces with The Showdowns, a Bay Area-based group comprised of Matt Berg (drums), AJ Leighton (bass), John Paterson (keys), and Whitt Vicena (lead guitar). The unity amongst the band can be felt at every show through their synergized performances.\nSongs from their debut album, Lucky Breaks, and music from James\u2019 solo work have been played generously on SiriusXM Radio, radio stations throughout California, and placed in TV commercial promos. Chris James and the Showdowns\u2019 second album, Somewhere out in California, is authentic, dance-driven, heartfelt, and has been getting loads of attention from various media outlets. They have a packed tour schedule for the rest of the year, including full band and solo performances.\nDriving down the open road can get us lost in our thoughts when surrounded by the right views and accompanied by the right music. The title track off the album, \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d begins with an acoustic guitar solo then joined by elegant piano keys. The intimate video is characterized by the natural beauty of California: the views, the ocean, and the forests. \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d is the narration of a restless heart, reminiscing on all the possible \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of life. Every day we are forced to make hundreds of choices, big and small. After making a decision we sometimes have afterthoughts, imagining how life would be if different decisions were made and if different things were said. The lyric, \u201cDid you ever feel like we missed the bus\u201d is the metaphorical concern of making the wrong choices in the past and missing prime opportunities or possible new adventures. It is essential to remind ourselves to take risks: if not, we will regret all the possibilities that could\u2019ve been.\n\n--\"James' style of writing is hard to deny as it rings of times and life situations we can all relate to.

The Dresden-born artist has racked up numerous achievements, although it was his 2013 breakthrough hit \u2018My House\u2019, on OFF Recordings, that really propelled Purple Disco Machine into new heights; landing the #1 spot within Beatport\u2019s deep house chart and, at its peak, #3 overall. The track remains one of Beatport\u2019s best ever sellers and Purple Disco Machine ranks #18 in the online retailer\u2019s all-time Top 100 Artists chart. Since then, the German native has continued to recreate his previous chart domination with a series of original tracks including; his collaborations with Boris Dlugosch on Defected, \u2018L.O.V.E.\u2019 and \u2018Set It Out\u2019, his collaborations with Aeroplane on Spinnin\u2019 Deep, \u2018Sambal\u2019 and \u2018Counting On Me\u2019 featuring Aloe Blacc, plus his incredible double Pete Tong Essential New Tunes, \u2018Yo\u2019 on Kittball and the unforgettable \u2018Magic\u2019 on Exploited. As well as boasting an impressive back-catalogue of solo and collaborative productions, Purple Disco Machine has also offered up remixes for numerous A-list musicians, including: Jamiroquai, Two Door Cinema Club, New Order, Claptone, Tom Odell, Faithless, Shapeshifters, Hercules & Love Affair, Sigma Feat. Paloma Faith, Blonde and most recently, Gorillaz \u2013 reworking \u2018Andromeda\u2019 off their latest LP, \u2018Humanz\u2019. However, it\u2019s important to mention that Purple Disco Machine\u2019s impressive disco house grooves might not have even existed if it wasn\u2019t for his father introducing him, at an early age, to the classic funk sounds of the 70s and 80s. This early exposure had real influence on Tino and by the time he was a teenager, he didn\u2019t just want to listen to great music but also play it, produce it and be connected to the scene. Tino says \u201cThis was a really important time for me as I managed to land a job at a local record store and gain a DJ residency at my local club in Dresden. Neither job paid me any money but I could have as many records as I wanted from the record shop, so I had more than enough new music to play out on the weekend.\u201d With a rapidly expanding record collection and a DJ residency on-going, Tino craved to make his own music thus spending many years in the studio honing his sound and releasing tracks via a number of different projects/pseudonyms before giving birth to Purple Disco Machine. Outside the studio, Tino is a very in-demand touring DJ and his schedule has never been busier. Bringing his unparalleled sounds and unique mix of disco, nu disco, funk, house and deep house straight to the dancefloor at some of the world's finest clubs, festivals and events in countries, including; UK, USA, Australia, Russia, Germany, Holland, Spain, France plus many more. Purple Disco Machine is also a longstanding resident at the hugely successful \u2018Glitterbox\u2019 events in Ibiza which continues this year, plus the talented German has recently made his debut at the White Isle\u2019s iconic venue, Pacha. Indeed, 2017 is shaping up to be Purple Disco Machine\u2019s most prolific year to date, with the announcement of his debut album, \u2018Soulmatic\u2019, forthcoming via Australia\u2019s tastemaker label, Sweat It Out. Aiming to cover all aspects of \u2018disco\u2019 influenced dance music; the album will combine traditional disco house club tracks with funk, soul, boogie and indie disco jams. Collaborations include the likes of Faithless, Hip Hop legend Kool Keith, Bag Raiders, Duane Harden and Karen Harding as well as a number of very exciting newcomers. The album\u2019s pre-campaign club-focused taster single \u2018Body Funk\u2019, released in early May, has set the tone and the bar high by becoming BBC Radio 1\u2019s most played dance record of the month and scoring double #1 chart success on Beatport and Traxsource. Throw in a number high-profile remixes such as the aforementioned rework of the Gorillaz as well live dates in countries from Ibiza to America, and it\u2019s clear to see why this year is one of the German funk machine\u2019s most exciting chapters in his already illustrious career.

These musicians, along with classic troubadours from his father's record collection like James Taylor, would serve as the initial inspiration for writing his own songs.\n\nFollowing a long post-college musical hiatus, Rob moved from New York City to Arizona and, encouraged by his wife, started to take songwriting seriously for the first time. After a year of experimenting with a variety of genres and discovering his voice, he developed his own blend of folk, rock and reggae infused with a heavy serving of conscious lyrics.\n\nWith a newfound focus and a fresh batch of songs, Rob recorded his debut full-length album in 2017, The Calm Within, a collection of rootsy tunes inspired by his yoga and meditation practice, as well as his love of the outdoors.

Among its many awesomely quirky attractions (beyond dope AF lobster rolls, of course), the mini-metropolis boasts the International Cryptozoology Museum and even served as the site of the nation\u2019s first chewing gum factory. Suffice it to say, the town possesses all kinds of character and charm. It also makes perfect sense as HQ for Weakened Friends. Three alternative rock wiseasses and snack food connoisseurs, the trio\u2014Sonia Sturino [vocals, guitar], Annie Hoffman [bass], and Cam Jones [drums]\u2014first congregated in their adopted hometown during 2014. Sonia had recently relocated from Toronto and holed up in a house with Cam and a bunch of other dudes before witnessing Annie play live and asking her to join the band. As they released two independent EPs, Gloomy Tunes and Crushed, they stirred up a palpable buzz (between consuming sour spaghetti and causing trouble). Gigs followed with everyone from CHVRCHES and Silversun Pickups to Beach Slang and Juliana Hatfield as they made their 2017 debut at SXSW and earned praise from Vanyaland, CBS, If It\u2019s Too Loud, and many more. A wiry, whimsical, and wild fusion of disarmingly pop hooks and fuzzed-out riffery that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the Reality Bites soundtrack or in a modern Brooklyn bar fueled this quiet rise. \u201cIf something is ear catching and interesting, I\u2019m drawn to it,\u201d says Sturino. \u201cI love pop hooks, but I have this truly weird and shaky voice. I started to embrace that, and I think people connect to the sound.\u201d For the uninitiated, they\u2019ll definitely connect to the group\u2019s 2017 single \u201cHate Mail\u201d featuring J Mascis. On the track, a buzz of feedback slips into melodic guitar and an unshakable rhythm as the frontwoman captivates with the confessionally catchy refrain, \u201cI hate everything you\u2019re saying, get away from me. I hate everything we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a waste of me.\u201d It\u2019s the perfect backdrop for an epic Mascis cameo. \u201cIt\u2019s about when I was miserable in this other band,\u201d recalls Sturino. \u201cThis is the most important thing to me. I don\u2019t live comfortably. I don\u2019t have a lot of money. I don\u2019t have a lot of free time, because I\u2019m putting all of my effort, passion, and self into music. So, it has to be the right situation. At the time, I just wasn\u2019t working with the right team. The song is about those corrosive relationships with emotionally abusive assholes. J is a guitar god for indie rock. He\u2019s an obvious inspiration, and he killed it.\u201d \u201cHate Mail\u201d hints at a lot more to come from Weakened Friends. For Sturino, the band brings everything full circle. In tow with her best friend Cam and wife Annie, she encodes a powerful message in the lyrics. \u201cA lot of times, you hear expressions like, \u2018Find your happy\u2019,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI think you should find yourself. Our music is about self-awareness and finding that. Sometimes, you\u2019re having a shitty day. It can be hard, and that\u2019s beautiful in its own way. In the North American mentality, if you\u2019re depressed or sad, you have to just get rid of it. This is less about getting rid of that feeling and finding those things causing the feeling and dealing with them. It\u2019s self-awareness, believing in yourself, finding yourself, and defining how you feel. That\u2019s what this band is to me.\u201d We're three tall young adults making some songs and eating some snacks.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Lubbock, Texas is an unlikely environment for a boy to dream of being a jazz musician. Fortunately, Tom had a direct link to this creative art form through his dad, James (\"J.T.\") Braxton.\n\nAfter graduating valedictorian from high school, Tom attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas on track and music scholarships. \u201cI love to run, and the 200, 400, and 1600-meter relay were my events.\u201d During his college years, Braxton formed the jazz fusion band \u201cNo Compromise\u201d which toured the southwest and opened concerts for Joe Sample, Stanley Clarke, George Howard, and many others. The band performed many of Tom\u2019s original compositions which helped to fine-tune his writing style.\n\nAs his college years came to a close, the band fizzled out and Tom launched a solo career. His first act of business was to join forces with keyboardist and producer Bernard Wright to release his solo debut, Your Move. \u201cThe highlight of my first release was having the opportunity to record a duet with long-time friend Kirk Whalum on the song \u201cPeacemaker.\u201d Bernard Wright not only produced Braxton\u2019s first CD, but was instrumental in connecting him to a gifted musician/producer who would elevate Tom to the national touring circuit. \u201cI have to credit Bernard Wright with getting me the gig with Wayman Tisdale. \u2018Nard was in Sacramento working with Wayman on some projects. Tisdale told \u2018Nard that he was starting a band and my name came up. I flew to Sacramento and played with Wayman at the Red Lion Hotel where we opened a concert for the Yellowjackets. I\u2019ll never forget it . . . it was 1992!! Except for a few years off during the births of my sons, I\u2019ve been playing with Wayman ever since.\u201d\n\nBraxton\u2019s second album, Katallasso, mixed memorable, lite-funk melodies with some unique production touches. In April 1998, the CD was released nationally on Positive Music Records and featured the talents of Kirk Whalum, Paul Jackson Jr., Bill Maxwell, and Bill Cantos. For Tom\u2019s third album, he took a brief departure from mainstream smooth jazz and in 1999 released an instrumental praise and worship CD entitled Face to Face. Two years later, he followed it up with the release of Comfort and Joy, a Christmas album that presented Braxton\u2019s fresh arrangements of traditional and contemporary holiday favorites. His fifth release, Bounce, was produced by Wayman Tisdale for Dave Koz\u2019s label, Rendezvous Entertainment. \u201cWayman approached me with the idea of doing a project together,\u201d recalls Braxton. \u201cI was very excited and the creative juices began to flow. We had a lot of fun in the studio playing with grooves and melodies and the CD, Bounce, was born.\u201d In 2007 the CD Imagine This was released.\n\nTom has shared the stage with many well-known artists including Luther Vandross, Phillip Bailey, Kirk Whalum, Jonathan Butler, Dave Koz, George Duke, Jeff Golub, Marcus Miller, and Paul Brown. Tom has opened concerts for numerous jazz greats including Dave Brubeck, Cab Calloway, Spyro Gyra, Najee, Rippingtons, David Benoit, Norman Brown, Pieces of a Dream, Boney James, Michael Franks, and The Crusaders.\n\nOver the years, Braxton has been featured in several publications including JAZZIZ, Smooth Jazz News, and the international Italian music magazine, New Sounds. He has also appeared on CBS\u2019s The Saturday Early Show, B.E.T.\u2019s Jazz Central, TBS, TNT, ESPN, CNN, NBC\u2019s Inside Stuff, Positively Texas, Good Morning Texas, and the Fox Network\u2019s Good Day Dallas.\n\nSeasoned with experience and gifted with a fresh sound that has widespread appeal, Tom Braxton is destined to be a key player in the music industry in the 21st century.\n\nTom Braxton's Official site: www.tombraxton.com\nTom Braxton's My Space site: www.myspace.com/tombraxton", "otherInfo": "Full Food and Bar Menu Available in all sectionsThis versatile instrumentalist and gifted composer is a seasoned performer who has the amazing ability to grab the heart-strings of the audience within the first few minutes of his show; engage them with his exceptional skill, wit, and charm; and leave them astounded, clapping, and on their feet screaming for more!

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "180 Eureka Sq, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "Thrive", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9730407.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.48864, 37.63265], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Dub, RnB, Reggae Roots, Soul, Reggae, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Longboard Margarita Bar", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cDon\u2019t be a follower when you can be a leader.\u201d\n\n-Thrive, \u201cFreedom of speech\u201d\n\nThrive is an American Reggae group founded in 2008 by singer/songwriter duo Aaron Borowitz and Kenneth Rogers.

This album follows their 2009 studio release, Pacific Dust, and a four-disc retrospective compilation, Days of Sun and Grass, both of which garnered critical praise from outlets including The New Yorker, Mojo, Relix, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and cemented the band's reputation as creators of \"California Soul.\" Co-founded by principal songwriter/lead vocalist Tim Bluhm and guitarist/vocalist Greg Loiacono, the Mother Hips has spawned its own community and even its own rock festival, Hipnic. Held at Big Sur, Hipnic is now in its fifth year and has featured like-minded California bands including Cass McCombs, Jackie Greene, Al Jardine, Neal Casal, Dawes and others.\n\nIt's been a long, winding journey since their 1993 debut on Rick Rubin's American Recordings, Back to the Grotto, through to the present day, which finds them in full charge of their own careers. Through it all, the Mother Hips are self-sustaining and, 20 years in, continue to operate as a cottage industry. The band also has its own beer and its own wine.\n\nBehind Beyond, recorded over the past year at Mission Bells Studio in San Francisco with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, finds Bluhm wading cautiously into midlife, exploring thoughts of mortality as if it were a hazy dream. Loiacono, the man behind the many instrumental passages that weave through the album, says that this album \"stretches out a lot more than any of our other records.\" There's a sense of ease with these songs, from the laid-back feel of \"Isle Not of Man\" to the psychedelic guitar interplay of \"Jefferson Army.\"\n\n\nBluhm is the tall, rugged, frontman that pulls the listener in while Loiacono is the compact, explosive guitar ace that drives the music. But it's their partnership -- the unique, almost brotherly way they sing and play together -- that defines the band.\n\nWhen asked what makes this album special, the two bandleaders come at it from a different angle. Loiacono references the second track, \"Freed From A Prison,\" a song he wrote but that Bluhm sings, citing the ability to let go of the song that made it work. \"That song is about the concept of being freed from a prison you didn't even know you were in,\" he says. \"It's this idea of finally opening up to an experience that was there for you the whole time. To me, a lot of this album is like that.\"\n\nBluhm says that making the music meaningful -- going beyond just having a solid, well-played tune -- is the most important thing for him. \"It's about making creative choices that are unconventional but that are still appealing that hopefully can reach the listener in a way they didn't expect and affect parts of their heart and mind they didn't expect to be affected by rock music, he says. I'm trying to make music that has a spiritual aspect where it's more than just a good song and more than just a rocking band or a commodity, an emotional experience that you might not even know is happening because it's surrounded by a loud rock band.\"\n\nIt all started in 1990 at California State University in Chico when Bluhm and Loaicano found themselves living in the same house, teaching each other guitar chords and experimenting with harmony. They didn't realize it but they were laying the foundation for a sound, a style and a partnership that would last their entire lives. The Hips were signed to Rick Rubin's American Recordings while still in college and released their debut in 1993, followed by 1995's Part Timer Goes Full and 1996's Shootout. The band found themselves swept up into the life of major label touring, along with the heavy partying and relentless grind that has destroyed countless bands. Little promotion from the label found the Hips self-releasing 1998's Later Days and regrouping as a band.\n\nSince then, they've gone on to release independent studio albums (Green Hills of Earth, Kiss The Crystal Flake, and Pacific Dust) and have cultivated one of the most rabid and loyal fan bases in rock today. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, the Hips returned from a four-year hiatus (2001 - 2005) to find that they were more popular than ever. The core line-up of the band has remained stable since 2004, Bluhm, Loiaconco and drummer John Hofer. In 2011, Paul Hoaglin left the band and Frank Zappa and Fear bassist Scott Thunes joined the Hips. These days, the Mother Hips have changed their approach to touring, playing 80 shows a year rather than hundreds, concentrating on well-defined tour markets rather than staying out for long hauls.\n\nToday the Hips are free; they make their own schedule, recording and touring when it feels right. They're a successful independent business as well, having built up a loyal following and community for their sound and gaining the respect of their peers and critics along the way. Bluhm coined the term \"California Soul\" back in 1998 with the song \"Gold Plated\" when he sang: \"There's some boys I know/ who play that rock & roll / they've slept on a lot of floors / to get that California Soul.\" Flash forward nearly two decades. The term has stuck and they're proud of the monicker.\n\n\"California isn't just a state,\" explains Bluhm. \"It's a psychic idea ... the end of the frontier. It's not just a place; it's a style and a state of mind.\"\n\nThe same thing can be said about the Mother Hips.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1807 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "The Wood Brothers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8297629.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk Rock, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Fox Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Two brothers decide to form a band, adapting the blues, folk and other roots?music sounds they loved as kids into their own evocative sound and twining their voices in the sort of high?lonesome harmony blend for which sibling singers are often renowned.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "427 Mendocino Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95401", "Artist": "Gill Landry", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9734075.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.715214, 38.441851], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Lost Church Santa Rosa", "moreBioInfo": "Gill Landry is a two-time Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Louisiana.\n\nPrior to releasing his first solo album, Landry and singer Woody Pines formed an old-time jug band called The Kitchen Syncopators in New Orleans, LA.

Kenneth\u2019s musical styling and dynamic live performances also attracted the attention of some of his mentors like Lucinda Williams, Billy Gibbons and current bandmate Steve Ferrone of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Since 2013, he spent two years touring with multi-Grammy winner Lucinda Williams, who describes the sound of the live band as \u201csomewhere between Lynyrd Skynyrd and Drive-By Truckers\u201d. He has also opened for ZZ Top, Steve Winwood, and Blackberry Smoke.

Kenneth and Steve met a couple of years ago at a gathering thrown by a mutual pal. Not long after, he needed a drummer for a Hollywood gig and Steve sat in with the band. He has worked with Kenneth to hone the sound and helped him the right players. And as they say, the rest is history. Handpicked by Steve, drummer Chris Cano plays with the KBB when Ferrone is on the road with the Heartbreakers. Popular session bass guitarist and Disresputable Few member, Paul Ill, joined the band at Steve\u2019s urging and perfectly rounded out the Kenneth Brian Band sound. \u201cThose two were the perfect combination for what I do,\u201d said Kenneth. \u201cTheir influence has helped elevate my playing and just being around Steve is a master class on how to be a successful artist and a decent human being,\u201d he continued. In true KBB form, the sound of the new album honors a distinctive blend of Southern Rock that is both progressive and rooted in tradition.\n\nWhile Kenneth currently resides in Los Angeles, he originally hails from the South. Born in Virginia, he spent some of his formative years in Alabama before his family settled in the musically rich town of Gainesville, Florida. From a very young age, he realized his passion for creating music and has pursued it with vigor. He penned his first country song on an old guitar at the ripe age of 4 and became serious about the guitar at age 11.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville in 2001, Kenneth hit the road with a new sound steeped in tradition.\n\n\u2018With Lions,\u2019 out May 19, 2017 on Robo Records, was recorded at Dave\u2019s Room Studio in Hollywood, California.

This album follows their 2009 studio release, Pacific Dust, and a four-disc retrospective compilation, Days of Sun and Grass, both of which garnered critical praise from outlets including The New Yorker, Mojo, Relix, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and cemented the band's reputation as creators of \"California Soul.\" Co-founded by principal songwriter/lead vocalist Tim Bluhm and guitarist/vocalist Greg Loiacono, the Mother Hips has spawned its own community and even its own rock festival, Hipnic. Held at Big Sur, Hipnic is now in its fifth year and has featured like-minded California bands including Cass McCombs, Jackie Greene, Al Jardine, Neal Casal, Dawes and others.\n\nIt's been a long, winding journey since their 1993 debut on Rick Rubin's American Recordings, Back to the Grotto, through to the present day, which finds them in full charge of their own careers. Through it all, the Mother Hips are self-sustaining and, 20 years in, continue to operate as a cottage industry. The band also has its own beer and its own wine.\n\nBehind Beyond, recorded over the past year at Mission Bells Studio in San Francisco with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, finds Bluhm wading cautiously into midlife, exploring thoughts of mortality as if it were a hazy dream. Loiacono, the man behind the many instrumental passages that weave through the album, says that this album \"stretches out a lot more than any of our other records.\" There's a sense of ease with these songs, from the laid-back feel of \"Isle Not of Man\" to the psychedelic guitar interplay of \"Jefferson Army.\"\n\n\nBluhm is the tall, rugged, frontman that pulls the listener in while Loiacono is the compact, explosive guitar ace that drives the music. But it's their partnership -- the unique, almost brotherly way they sing and play together -- that defines the band.\n\nWhen asked what makes this album special, the two bandleaders come at it from a different angle. Loiacono references the second track, \"Freed From A Prison,\" a song he wrote but that Bluhm sings, citing the ability to let go of the song that made it work. \"That song is about the concept of being freed from a prison you didn't even know you were in,\" he says. \"It's this idea of finally opening up to an experience that was there for you the whole time. To me, a lot of this album is like that.\"\n\nBluhm says that making the music meaningful -- going beyond just having a solid, well-played tune -- is the most important thing for him. \"It's about making creative choices that are unconventional but that are still appealing that hopefully can reach the listener in a way they didn't expect and affect parts of their heart and mind they didn't expect to be affected by rock music, he says. I'm trying to make music that has a spiritual aspect where it's more than just a good song and more than just a rocking band or a commodity, an emotional experience that you might not even know is happening because it's surrounded by a loud rock band.\"\n\nIt all started in 1990 at California State University in Chico when Bluhm and Loaicano found themselves living in the same house, teaching each other guitar chords and experimenting with harmony. They didn't realize it but they were laying the foundation for a sound, a style and a partnership that would last their entire lives. The Hips were signed to Rick Rubin's American Recordings while still in college and released their debut in 1993, followed by 1995's Part Timer Goes Full and 1996's Shootout. The band found themselves swept up into the life of major label touring, along with the heavy partying and relentless grind that has destroyed countless bands. Little promotion from the label found the Hips self-releasing 1998's Later Days and regrouping as a band.\n\nSince then, they've gone on to release independent studio albums (Green Hills of Earth, Kiss The Crystal Flake, and Pacific Dust) and have cultivated one of the most rabid and loyal fan bases in rock today. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, the Hips returned from a four-year hiatus (2001 - 2005) to find that they were more popular than ever. The core line-up of the band has remained stable since 2004, Bluhm, Loiaconco and drummer John Hofer. In 2011, Paul Hoaglin left the band and Frank Zappa and Fear bassist Scott Thunes joined the Hips. These days, the Mother Hips have changed their approach to touring, playing 80 shows a year rather than hundreds, concentrating on well-defined tour markets rather than staying out for long hauls.\n\nToday the Hips are free; they make their own schedule, recording and touring when it feels right. They're a successful independent business as well, having built up a loyal following and community for their sound and gaining the respect of their peers and critics along the way. Bluhm coined the term \"California Soul\" back in 1998 with the song \"Gold Plated\" when he sang: \"There's some boys I know/ who play that rock & roll / they've slept on a lot of floors / to get that California Soul.\" Flash forward nearly two decades. The term has stuck and they're proud of the monicker.\n\n\"California isn't just a state,\" explains Bluhm. \"It's a psychic idea ... the end of the frontier. It's not just a place; it's a style and a state of mind.\"\n\nThe same thing can be said about the Mother Hips.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "180 Eureka Sq, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "Thrive", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9730407.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.48864, 37.63265], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Dub, RnB, Reggae Roots, Soul, Reggae, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Longboard Margarita Bar", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cDon\u2019t be a follower when you can be a leader.\u201d\n\n-Thrive, \u201cFreedom of speech\u201d\n\nThrive is an American Reggae group founded in 2008 by singer/songwriter duo Aaron Borowitz and Kenneth Rogers.

The decision to put their respective bands (JT\u2019s \u201cJT & The Clouds\u201d & Allison's \"Po' Girl\") on hiatus and tour together was a pivotal move, applauded by their fans, and growing numbers of new listeners.\n\nAfter a year of hard touring, and much buzzed about appearances at summer festivals (Strawberry, High Sierra, Kerrville, Hillside, Delfest, Vancouver Island among others) the band decided to record a live album in front of their hometown fans. The result \"Live from Space,\" released January 2014, captures this rising band in absolute top form. By turns raw, raucous, whispered and hushed, it revealed the bands full dynamic range.

It\u2019s a musical relationship that has endured for over two decades, with band members playing in numerous projects together and apart. Following the 2012 release of their freewheeling Sounds Like This, the band took time off to work on various side projects. Zach Gill (keys/vocals) toured the world with the band\u2019s college pal Jack Johnson; Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar/vocals) played shows with the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh; Steve Adams (bass/vocals) toured and recorded with Nicki Bluhm & the Gramblers; Dave Brogan (drums/vocals) joined up with Utah band, Mokie. These and other endeavors have influenced the band\u2019s new album Tangle Of Time.\n\nMore than previous releases, Tangle Of Time really taps into what makes ALO unique. It\u2019s that special blend of classic songwriting and the ability to stretch out jams and distill dance floor grooves. It's heartfelt lyrics that make you smile, reflect and just want to sing along either way. It's four great musicians who all write and sing. And four friends who've been through a lot together and still support, challenge and inspire one another.\n\nEntering Allegiant Records in San Anselmo, California this past January with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, the four members decided they\u2019d take a different recording approach. Instead of spending pre-production days jamming and co-writing, each member brought in their own demos, roughly three dozen in total, for the group to listen to, pick apart and eventually whittle down to the 11 songs that make up Tangle Of Time. Once they narrowed their focus, they turned their attention to arrangements and production techniques. Songs were tightened up, layers made more experimental and the end results validated their new approach.\n\nLebo described the shared respect and admiration the band felt during the recording process this way: \"There are four strong opinions in the room, but playing together for so long we've all become pretty good at the empathy thing at this point; we can be very Zen about it. We truly value being together at this point in our careers, and whatever we get from our solo and side gigs, no matter how much fun we have, it's not this.\"\n\nThat sort of maturity, the ability to take stock of your friends, loved ones, and collaborators, and truly appreciate them is certainly one of the cornerstones of Tangle Of Time. Lebo, Adams and Gill first started playing music together in middle school, and then with Brogan right after college. Somehow, these relationships have lasted, evolved and been made stronger every year. One can almost hear the group releasing a satisfied existential sigh throughout the album, finding acceptance, love and contentment with the world they've built.\n\n\"I really appreciate the guys right now, more so than ever,\" Gill shared, excitedly adding, \"Years ago the feeling was, 'I wanna get to my songs and see how they sound while we're all here', whereas now I'm rooting for everyone else's songs. It's great.\"\n\nThat approach of supporting each other\u2019s songs worked like a charm, capturing each member\u2019s distinct songwriting voice, while simultaneously expanding the notion of what an ALO song or album can be. Take for instance the one-two-punch of the synth-filled, spacey jam vehicle \"The Ticket\" and the pedal steel-driven easy-going happiness of \"Simple Times\". Although two ends of the sonic spectrum, both are classic Gill songs at their core but stretched wide and far by the band\u2019s collective effort.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lebo's guitar epic \"Undertow\" is a song that practically begs to be stretched out live, with its swirling double guitar outro intoxicating the listener to such a degree that you might find yourself on the band's website, dreamily purchasing tickets for an entire run of shows just to see where the song ventures live. Lebo pairs this with \"Push\", a jaunty yet thoughtful number with a playful guitar riff that's basically the musical equivalent of joy.\n\n\"Not Old Yet\" and \"Keep On\", Adams\u2019 contributions to the album, are also touchstones to the spirit of Tangle Of Time. The first is a light-hearted romp about keeping a positive perspective on life\u2019s long road of hurdles and surprises, while the second is an upbeat, forward-thinking sing-along with lines that could be the album's mantra: \"Wherever this takes us, I know/That we've got each other, we've still got a long way to go.\"\n\nBrogan's \"Coast To Coast\" is among the most intriguing songs on the record. He, along with co-writer buddy Ben Malan, came up with a layer-upon-layer soundscape consisting of beautifully esoteric textures. The funky but ominous track tells the surreal tale of a band on the run, with more ideas and energy than know-how. Brogan shared that the theme of \u201ctangled time\u201d materialized unexpectedly over the course of the sessions, elaborating: \"There's a point where there is more behind you than ahead of you, and you realize that time becomes a limiting factor.\"\n\nPut the record on your turntable, and you can clearly hear the band\u2019s excitement to get back on the road and explore these songs with their audience. Improvisation is a staple of what the band does, and as Adams stated: \"Being in that unknown is such a great life lesson beyond just the music. For all the careful planning and preparing we do, being in the moment is really when it all matters.\"\n\nThe band is also planning new ways to expand the theatrical shenanigans that have become a fantastic complement to the live show. From confetti canons to 12-foot beach balls, pre-show skits to elaborate theme nights, bubble suits to a laser-shooting ukulele (yes, really)... ALO is always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to interact with fans to make their shows truly special. Gill, the band's head prankster, put it this way: \"I want people to come to a show expecting to be engaged in a fun and creative way. When I see someone dancing or singing along or reaching out to hit a giant beach ball, I start playing to the dancer and at that point, it's really a circle of energy traveling back and forth from the stage. The larger theatrical concepts are ways of interacting with the audience on another level.\"\n\nOn Tangle Of Time the band has reached that other level, and are ready to bring everyone along.", "otherInfo": "All ages show."}, {"Address": "1600 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "SUPER WHATEVR", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9663752.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399885, 37.765168], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Thee Parkside", "moreBioInfo": "For SUPER WHATEVR, sincerity is a surround-sound experience.\n\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s guided Orange County, California\u2019s Skyler McKee to this point, and now, with a debut full-length Never Nothing due January 19 on Hopeless Records, it\u2019s a trait he\u2019s not about to abandon.\n\nOn its surface, Never Nothing is the sound of an up-and-coming artist developing his style, bursting with nervous energy, buoyant rhythms and earworm melodies. But spend some time with the songs, and you\u2019ll begin to uncover the weighty themes McKee has expertly hidden inside them.\n\nSuper Whatevr\u2019s songs don\u2019t seek to push away the darkness. Instead, they invite it in, realizing the only way to move past life\u2019s problems is to tackle them head-on. They\u2019re songs that force listeners to confront the ugliness in ourselves (\u201cTelelelevision\u201d) and those closest to us (\u201cFor You\u201d). They come from a dark place, but they\u2019re undercut with a ray of hope.\n\n\u201cAll my songs are happy,\u201d McKee explains. \u201cThey have a sad tone, but it\u2019s all in a positive manner. I want to help people grow and be vulnerable. If it\u2019s got to be dark, then it\u2019s going to be dark. It doesn\u2019t hurt me, because I know it\u2019s going to help me grow and help other people grow.\u201d\n\nSuper Whatevr was born as a vehicle for McKee\u2019s poetry in 2013. Up until that point he had only played bass, but began studying the craft of songwriting with the help of a friend and penning songs of his own. Armed with a trio of influential albums (Cage the Elephant\u2019s Thank You, Happy Birthday, Tokyo Police Club\u2019s Champ and Manchester Orchestra\u2019s COPE), his songwriting foundation took roots in emotive, dynamic rock\u2014all undercut with hyper-personal lyricism. 2016\u2019s Good Luck EP introduced Super Whatevr to the world, and Never Nothing is poised to help McKee become a force in the underground.\n\nFrom the album\u2019s title (\u201cThe concept of the album title is that [what might be wrong with you] is never \u2018nothing,\u2019\u201d McKee says) and symbolic artwork (a piece called \u201cOut Of You Becomes Me\u201d) to the songs themselves, Never Nothing is a comprehensive, cathartic work about pushing past your demons on the way to self-betterment. Above all else, McKee hopes it\u2019ll serve as a conduit for happier lives\u2014and not only his own.\n\n\u201cI plan on starting an online therapy session with the therapist who got me through what I was dealing with,\u201d McKee says. \u201cI\u2019ll be directing anyone who needs help to that. I can be the surrogate that helps you get to a place that gets you comfortable. I don\u2019t need to be your savior, but I can be the person who can push you to the place where you can get better.\u201d XX", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "401 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "William Kanengiser", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/244373.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420688, 37.779613], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Latin, Classical, World Fusion, Classical Crossover", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Herbst Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Recognized as one of the USA\u2019s finest classical guitarists, William Kanengiser instills each piece he plays with a dramatic, narrative intention.

This is just one more factor that gives their performances an energy and immediacy that backing tracks and sequencers can\u2019t.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the Beatles\u2019 later work and the fact that it was never intended to be performed live, what The Fab Four do onstage is phenomenal.

Pepper/psychedelic era, and the Abbey Road period and beyond, with many shows also including a Shea Stadium set.\n\nThe band typically changes costumes twice, for a total of three period-perfect looks: the identical black chesterfield suits worn by the original lads during their Ed Sullivan Show debut, the colorful satin Sgt. Pepper uniforms and regalia worn by the Beatles during their psychedelic era, and the totally divergent clothing styles that marked the later Beatles and post-Beatles years. Select shows also feature the beige safari-style jackets and black trousers that have come to be known as the Beatles' Shea Stadium suits.\n\nThe band also periodically plays specialty shows for various Beatles-related anniversaries, such as shows that feature an entire Beatles album, played from start to finish, along with additional selections from the rest of the Beatles' extensive catalog. True to the material and era they cover, each of these shows brings in additional, highly authentic costumes from the period.\n\nThe Fab Four truly are The Ultimate Tribute to The Beatles -- the most accurate representation of the originals you'll find this side of the 1960s!", "otherInfo": "Emmy Award-winning Beatles tribute band The Fab Four is a highly polished tribute act that has been wowing audiences across the U.S. and around the world with its dynamic portrayal of the Beatles for over two decades.

Mastering the craft of songwriting far preceded his accomplishments as an actor and best-selling author.\n\nWith 25 million records sold, a Grammy\u00ae Award for his No. 1 smash-hit Jessie\u2019s Girl, and whopping 17 Top-40 hits including Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers, An Affair of the Heart, I've Done Everything for You, Love Somebody and Human Touch, Springfield has no intention of taking his foot off the accelerator. \u201cI put everything I've got into making records,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes people think they have you pegged but I trust my music show them otherwise.\u201d\n\nNever one to be confined to the recording studio where the music is born, Springfield has toured for over 30 years, hand-delivering the hits to millions of fans worldwide during his legendary, high-energy live shows. Hardly content walking in his own footprints for very long, fall 2013 saw Springfield reinvent himself yet again performing for the first time as a purely solo act. Rick Springfield\u2019s \u201cStripped Down\u201d performances offer an intimate glimpse in to the amazing life he\u2019s experienced through music, with personal stories introducing each song in the set. \u201cSome are favorite songs that I\u2019ve written that I\u2019ve never performed live because they\u2019ve never quite fit into the full band live show. I think fans are as excited to now hear these songs live as I am to play them.\u201d\n\nExcited fans, sell-out shows and overwhelming critical acclaim have made Rick Springfield \u201cStripped Down\u201d one of the must-see shows of 2014. \u201c\u2026fans came in droves, selling out both shows practically from the get go\u2026the night as a whole achieved its purpose of revealing several unseen sides of Springfield beyond the most obvious\u2026\u201d says the Illinois Entertainer.\n\nSpringfield will take a short hiatus from his successful \u201cStripped Down\u201d solo tour this summer, hitting the road with his band on a co-headlining tour with friends Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo. The multi-city tour kicks off June 28th in Atlanta, GA with additional dates across the U.S. through July. This tour marks the first time that Rick will tour with Pat & Neil. Springfield says, \u201cAlthough I first met Pat and Neil when Neil played on the original recording of Jessie\u2019s Girl in 1980, it took 35 years before we got together to tour. It should be one for the books.\u201d Following his summer tour, Springfield will return to his native Australia this October for his first headline tour there in 20 years. Springfield will wrap up 2014 with an additional string of \u201cStripped Down\u201d performances.\n\nOn May 6th 2014, Simon & Schuster\u2019s Touchtone imprint will publish Springfield\u2019s fiction debut, MAGNIFICENT VIBRATION. Already receiving rave reviews, Booklist says, \u201cCaptivating, poignant, and hilarious, MAGNIFICENT VIBRATION proves that some of the most interesting stories can come from pretty unlikely places.\u201d The deeply meaningful and over-the-top novel features a hero who has hit a dead end in his life but who serendipitously receives an 800 connection to God via an inscription in a mysterious self-help book and who just may have a shot at saving the planet. \"The only good grades I ever got in school before I was kicked out were for creative writing,\u201d says Springfield. \u201cI thought that fiction might be in my future but then my career took a different path once the Beatles showed me what a blast being in a band could be. Writing my memoir reminded me how much I love the craft. So I decided to give fiction a shot again. MAGNIFICENT VIBRATION is the result. I\u2019m still not quite sure where it came from, but once I got going, it practically wrote itself. I\u2019ve heard writers I admire speak of that phenomenon, so maybe I\u2019m on the right track.\u201d\n\nSpringfield\u2019s autobiography, Late, Late at Night (Touchstone 2010) entered The New York Times best-seller list at No. 13 while also landing on the Los Angeles Times and Publishers Weekly top-sellers lists. Rolling Stone named it one of the top-25 rock memoirs of all time. In Late, Late At Night, which Springfield wrote entirely himself, Rick speaks frankly about the depression he\u2019s battled throughout his life. \u201cI\u2019m not the shiny, happy guy people think I am. I suppose they confuse who I really am with my stage persona,\u201d says Springfield. \u201cBut good can come from hardship. Depression causes me to over-analyze events in my life, and that\u2019s actually a bonus when it comes to songwriting. Hey, if things had gone my way at the time and I\u2019d gotten laid, Jessie\u2019s Girl would never have been written.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Springfield teamed up with Dave Grohl on Grohl\u2019s multi-faceted passion project, Sound City, which encompassed a documentary (Sound City), an album (Sound City: Real to Reel), and the Sound City Players tour, a string of critically acclaimed shows with fellow documentary subjects including Stevie Nicks, Trent Reznor, John Fogerty, and Lee Ving among others. The Foo Fighters served as backing band for Rick\u2019s set with Dave Grohl\u2019s notable declarations during the performances as, \"I want to be Rick Springfield!\" and \u201cBucket list. Check!\" CraveOnline called Sound City: Real to Reel \u201ca powerhouse collection of some of the greatest musical talent ever assembled.\u201d Springfield and Grohl co-wrote The Man That Never Was, which was inspired by a true story from World War II. \u201cWriting music can be a solo endeavor but at its heart, rock is collaborative. Working with Dave and the Foo Fighters was collaboration at its best. Those guys are true musicians: creative, spontaneous, generous, and talented. Working with them was a great experience.\u201d The Man That Never Was has been widely recognized by critics as one of the best songs on the Sound City soundtrack. \u201cThe highlights\u2026 are led by Stevie Nicks and, yes, Rick Springfield.\u201d (People) Springfield has also been hailed for his part in the documentary: \u201cThe film's breakout story is arguably Rick Springfield.\u201d (Rolling Stone) The Sound City: Real to Reel CD also won the 2014 Grammy\u00ae for Best Compilation Soundtrack.\n\nIn October 2012, Springfield released, Songs for the End of the World, his 17th studio recording and collaboration with songwriter Matt Bissonette. Songs for the End of the World addresses the need to be consoled and cherished in an age of anxiety about the future of the planet. Filled with personal lyrics and giant hooks, it\u2019s a pop/rock tour de force. \u201cIt's high energy,\u201d Rick explains about the album\u2019s mix of moods. \u201cAt its core, it\u2019s about looking for love and solace while the world around us\u2014everything we once felt sure about\u2014disintegrates. Even with the end so palpably imminent, we\u2019re still human beings, filled with longing and\u2014maybe against all odds\u2014hope. I believe music is healing,\u201d says Springfield. The Tampa Bay Times said, \u201cSpringfield remains one of the best live entertainers of his generation -- maybe the top dog -- so if he wants to explore darker closets on studio albums, I'm not going to discourage him one bit. Especially when the result is a project I enjoy as much as this one.\u201d\n\nAlso in 2012, an independently produced documentary titled An Affair of the Heart captured the relationship between Rick Springfield and his loyal fanbase. The documentary debuted at numerous film festivals, winning special jury awards at the Nashville, Florida, Boston, and Daytona Film Festivals. An Affair of the Heart premiered to record numbers on the EPIX channel in May 2013 and is now available on DVD.\n\nIn the early \u201970s, Springfield had a handful of hit records in his native Australia before emigrating to the United States. Bouncing between record labels and looking to make ends meet until his musical career took hold in the US, he resorted to acting and eventually landing the role of Dr. Noah Drake during the heyday and cult phenomenon of daytime TV\u2019s General Hospital. Simultaneously, the explosive success of his breakthrough 1981 album Working Class Dog was followed by Success Hasn\u2019t Spoiled Me Yet, Living in Oz, Hard to Hold soundtrack and Tao, establishing Springfield as a multi-platinum superstar. Despite his original and unwavering passion for music, many at the time mistook Springfield for a soap star hoping to convert daytime success to a faux and possibly fleeting music career. History proves that nothing could have been further from the truth. Springfield is content to let his music and four decades of productivity speak for itself. \u201cIf you pay attention to where I\u2019ve put my time, who I really am becomes clear.\u201d In addition to General Hospital, Rick\u2019s other notable TV roles include a 4-episode arc on Californication, Hawaii Five-O, Drop Dead Diva, Hot In Cleveland and the 1994-1997 TV series High Tide.\n\nSpringfield\u2019s current musical career renaissance can be traced back to the albums Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance (2004) and Venus in Overdrive (Ume, 2008), which entered the Billboard sales charts at No. 28, his highest debut in 20 years. In 2005, Sony Legacy\u2019s released the retrospective double CD Written in Rock: The Rick Springfield Anthology.\n\nOfficial web site: http://www.rickspringfield.com\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/rickspringfield\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/rickspringfield\nOn Instagram: http://instagram.com/rickspringfield\nOn YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/rsadmin", "otherInfo": "Concert to benefit Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), Friends of Camp Concord (FCC), Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS), and Boys and Girls Club (BGC).

But spend some time with the songs, and you\u2019ll begin to uncover the weighty themes McKee has expertly hidden inside them.\n\nSuper Whatevr\u2019s songs don\u2019t seek to push away the darkness. Instead, they invite it in, realizing the only way to move past life\u2019s problems is to tackle them head-on. They\u2019re songs that force listeners to confront the ugliness in ourselves (\u201cTelelelevision\u201d) and those closest to us (\u201cFor You\u201d). They come from a dark place, but they\u2019re undercut with a ray of hope.\n\n\u201cAll my songs are happy,\u201d McKee explains. \u201cThey have a sad tone, but it\u2019s all in a positive manner. I want to help people grow and be vulnerable. If it\u2019s got to be dark, then it\u2019s going to be dark. It doesn\u2019t hurt me, because I know it\u2019s going to help me grow and help other people grow.\u201d\n\nSuper Whatevr was born as a vehicle for McKee\u2019s poetry in 2013. Up until that point he had only played bass, but began studying the craft of songwriting with the help of a friend and penning songs of his own. Armed with a trio of influential albums (Cage the Elephant\u2019s Thank You, Happy Birthday, Tokyo Police Club\u2019s Champ and Manchester Orchestra\u2019s COPE), his songwriting foundation took roots in emotive, dynamic rock\u2014all undercut with hyper-personal lyricism. 2016\u2019s Good Luck EP introduced Super Whatevr to the world, and Never Nothing is poised to help McKee become a force in the underground.\n\nFrom the album\u2019s title (\u201cThe concept of the album title is that [what might be wrong with you] is never \u2018nothing,\u2019\u201d McKee says) and symbolic artwork (a piece called \u201cOut Of You Becomes Me\u201d) to the songs themselves, Never Nothing is a comprehensive, cathartic work about pushing past your demons on the way to self-betterment. Above all else, McKee hopes it\u2019ll serve as a conduit for happier lives\u2014and not only his own.\n\n\u201cI plan on starting an online therapy session with the therapist who got me through what I was dealing with,\u201d McKee says. \u201cI\u2019ll be directing anyone who needs help to that. I can be the surrogate that helps you get to a place that gets you comfortable.

Pepper and Abbey Road eras and beyond.\n\nBased in the Los Angeles area, the band has toured extensively since its founding in 1997 -- performing at hundreds of venues throughout the U.S. and in many countries across the globe, including Japan, Malaysia, France, Hong Kong, The United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil -- where they've skillfully recreated the Beatles' music multiple thousands of times, yet always with a freshness and excitement that audiences love.\n\nWhat makes The Fab Four unique among Beatles tribute bands is the not-so-simple fact that the four band members play all their own music live. This is just one more factor that gives their performances an energy and immediacy that backing tracks and sequencers can\u2019t.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the Beatles\u2019 later work and the fact that it was never intended to be performed live, what The Fab Four do onstage is phenomenal. Without a \u201cfifth Beatle\u201d anywhere in sight to make their job easier, these four highly accomplished musicians recreate all the sounds of an incredibly diverse catalog of Beatles favorites 100 percent live and in real time -- and their technical precision, musical artistry, and onstage chemistry make every concert a stunning performance!\n\nAudiences will appreciate their dynamic stage presence and the almost boundless energy that keeps them moving around the stage practically non-stop throughout the night, as they systematically move through the different Beatles eras, changing costumes between sets to represent the early Beatlemania years, the Sgt. Pepper/psychedelic era, and the Abbey Road period and beyond, with many shows also including a Shea Stadium set.\n\nThe band typically changes costumes twice, for a total of three period-perfect looks: the identical black chesterfield suits worn by the original lads during their Ed Sullivan Show debut, the colorful satin Sgt. Pepper uniforms and regalia worn by the Beatles during their psychedelic era, and the totally divergent clothing styles that marked the later Beatles and post-Beatles years. Select shows also feature the beige safari-style jackets and black trousers that have come to be known as the Beatles' Shea Stadium suits.\n\nThe band also periodically plays specialty shows for various Beatles-related anniversaries, such as shows that feature an entire Beatles album, played from start to finish, along with additional selections from the rest of the Beatles' extensive catalog. True to the material and era they cover, each of these shows brings in additional, highly authentic costumes from the period.\n\nThe Fab Four truly are The Ultimate Tribute to The Beatles -- the most accurate representation of the originals you'll find this side of the 1960s!", "otherInfo": "Emmy Award-winning Beatles tribute band The Fab Four is a highly polished tribute act that has been wowing audiences across the U.S. and around the world with its dynamic portrayal of the Beatles for over two decades.

They got a gig together one night at a tiny club in Oakland, and everyone there seemed to think their music was too weird. It didn't matter to them though. They immediately became close friends, and eventually brothers. They formed a partnership and decided to start throwing their own weird events in San Francisco that would cater to other like minded weirdos. They worked their asses off, and just kept booking more and more of their favorite weirdos. What started in a gritty hole in the wall in 2010, blossomed into the biggest reoccurring bass event in the country.\nRitual has hosted over 200 events, booked nearly 600 artists, and at our peak had up to 700 attendees every week. We expanded into LA, worked with festivals, threw big off-shoot events, and collaborated with many other major promoters. This party has always been fueled by the people who attend it, and we have been insanely lucky by our amazing crowd who became our friends over the years. There were never any fights at Ritual, and although scenes come with their share of dramas, our crowd has always been all about the music. We kept our events affordable so nearly everyone had access, and we learned everyone's name because we had genuine conversations and experiences. You all became our family.

He took this brisk pace into to a fall tour with Bear Grillz and a Ganja White Night tour at the beginning of this year that sold out nearly every date.\n\nAs a pioneer in the dubstep and bass music genres, Dirt Monkey has garnered support from many of his peers: Skream, Benga, Rusko, Excision, Zeds Dead, Griz, Virtual Riot, Annie Nightingale (BBC Radio 1), Flux Pavilion, Downlink, Ganja White Night, and Protohype. Dirt Monkey\u2019s recent remix of Rusko\u2019s \u201cWoo Boost\u201d (SubCarbon) was supported by Rusko himself, and his recent \u201cWubula\u201d album gained wide support across the festival circuit from broad swaths of well-known DJs.\n\nHe has worked and collaborated with a wide-variety of artists such as: Ganja White Night, DMVU, Illenium, Party Wave, Run DMT w Barrington Levy, AMP Live, and Jantsen. Dirt Monkey has performed at a countless number of breathtaking venues, including Red Rocks Amphitheatre, clubs in France, and Beta Nightclub in Denver, CO (where he has held a residency for the last 5 years). Also, for the past four years, he established and ran the record label, Kairos Audio, before handing it off to label partner and co-founder, Jantsen Robertson.\n\nFresh off a sold out co-headline tour with Subtronics, he used that momentum to go full steam into a headlining set at Shambhala. The wubs-master also made stops at EDC Las Vegas, Global Dance Festival, Nocturnal Wonderland, and Lost Lands and he\u2019 currently in the middle of a 40+ date fall tour in support of his most recent release on Rise of the Octopeel.\n\nDirt Monkey has always strived to fuse the wonky, high-energy sounds of old school dubstep, and the crisp sounds of IDM. Now, he\u2019s succeeding in bringing that sound to a global audience.", "otherInfo": "Liquid Stranger"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Twin Tribes", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Clan of Xymox at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Inzo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8751261.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Liquid Stranger"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Tyme", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ritual SF, Bootie Mashup & PLUR Alliance present\nRITUAL SF: NOTIXX & NOYA\nAbove DNA:\nNotixx\nNoya\nMr. Kitt\nWooSah\nLP Chilen\nDazzle Room:\nStaley\nPendaison\nJust Trees\nKoby\nMain Room: Bootie: Disney mashups with:\nDisney-themed burlesque from Hubba Hubba Revue\nAdrian A\nTyme\nJupiter Gatling\nand more!\nRitual, San Francisco's premier bass music event returns on March 7th at DNA Lounge! Nebakaneza and Johnny 5 were just two random DJs who were obsessed with music of all kinds, but what brought them together was their love of Dubstep, and bass heavy music. They met online after hyping each other up, because they listened to each other's mixes so much. They got a gig together one night at a tiny club in Oakland, and everyone there seemed to think their music was too weird. It didn't matter to them though. They immediately became close friends, and eventually brothers. They formed a partnership and decided to start throwing their own weird events in San Francisco that would cater to other like minded weirdos. They worked their asses off, and just kept booking more and more of their favorite weirdos. What started in a gritty hole in the wall in 2010, blossomed into the biggest reoccurring bass event in the country.\nRitual has hosted over 200 events, booked nearly 600 artists, and at our peak had up to 700 attendees every week. We expanded into LA, worked with festivals, threw big off-shoot events, and collaborated with many other major promoters. This party has always been fueled by the people who attend it, and we have been insanely lucky by our amazing crowd who became our friends over the years. There were never any fights at Ritual, and although scenes come with their share of dramas, our crowd has always been all about the music. We kept our events affordable so nearly everyone had access, and we learned everyone's name because we had genuine conversations and experiences. You all became our family. We never had a separate line for guest list because we never wanted anyone to feel less important than anyone else. Without you, we are nothing, and we are excited to re-capture that magic once again.\nNotixx is the musical conscience of Ryan Sinatra.

Norton and Edward A. Williams had been through a number of musical endeavours individually - including duos - and the prospect of a new project sounded intriguing. As details were hashed out, the core principles became readily evident: have fun and tour often. With a large stable of strong self and co-written songs and a prominent mission statement, Ash and Ed were ready to embark on a new journey. All that was needed was a name.\n\nAgain, a question: \u201cHow about \u2018whitherward\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe name took quickly, gaining a life of its own; within days, a website was created, local shows were booked, recordings were done, and a small tour was constructed. It was exciting and validating; a musical project where the sky was the limit, and no challenge seemed insurmountable.\n\nThen, after surveying the current outlook of their career, a new question arose: \u201cWhat if we toured full-time?\u201d\n\nIt would mean a lot of sacrifice - regular work schedules would be scuttled, permanent housing foregone, and material possessions reduced to a minimum. The performance requirements of sustaining a full-time tour would be grueling, and the workload more than doubles when considering the financial commitment required of being on the road indefinitely.\n\nBut amongst all the new responsibilities and stresses, there\u2019s an inherent mystery about the open road - from a typical human vantage, it\u2019s impossible to see what is around the next bend, over the next hill. In an ironic twist, this provides a startling clarity about life and how it can be lived - as so many people profess - day by day. When you can only see as far as the next hill, it somehow manages to decrease the amount of worry about what\u2019s on the other side. Rather, it helps to build a sense of wonder for what\u2019s over there, and you want to keep pushing to see it for yourself.\n\nThe duo now has four self-produced, self-published EPs full of intricate, thoughtful music, putting the emotions of life on the road and outside of the box on display. A full length album is in the works. New collaborations with bassist Patrick Hershey and violinist Stephanie Groot on both the 4th EP and the upcoming full-length album expand the sonic landscape of the duo\u2019s efforts. In addition to playing over 200 shows a year, their travels enable them to reach a number of diehard fans, new destinations, and old friends that serve to grow an ever-expanding audience.\n\nWhitherward is an Old English adverb that means \u201cin which direction\u201d. The word seems to invite an eternal question; it feels like the perfect fit for a duo that constantly seeks to reinvent itself in every aspect of its existence, always looking for the next impossible question to answer. There is forward; there is backward; and then there is Whitherward.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Clan of Xymox", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618593.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Post Punk", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "Clan of Xymox (also known as Xymox) blend an eclectic and vibrant mix of electronic pop, gothic rock, and acoustic folk. From the Netherlands, Xymox was established in 1985 by frontman Ronny Moorings and then-livein Anke Wolbert. Their first EP, Subsequent Pleasures added Pieter Nooten afterwards on keyboards and left a mark on an emerging Euro-wave market.\n\nA chance meeting with Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance led to an invitation to support that band on a UK tour, and then a recording contract with their record label, 4AD.\n\nTheir first two full length albums, self-titled Clan of Xymox and Medusa, comfortably settled Xymox into their own niche of blooming melodics and smooth grey lyrical originality, with Ronnie's songwriting coming as a fresh and very welcome abstract to the plastic and packaged synthpop of the late 80s. In 1989, Ronnie saw a chance to evolve and left 4AD, releasing Twist of Shadows which proved to be their most complete and mature offering thusfar, and was their most successful yet.\n\nWith the next two albums, Phoenix and Metamorphosis, fans were left with something of an out of body experience - as Xymox was sounding nothing like themselves. Metamorphosis was truly that however, its failure created a catalyst for Moorings to jump to yet another label, part ways with his bandmates, and pickup Mojca Zugna on bass. Zok records re-released Metamorphosis and a new EP - Headclouds. Moorings took a four year break to introspect and write, and gave fans the wondrous gift that is Hidden Faces, admittedly the logical followup to Medusa.\n\nThe new millenium ushered in success for Creatures, Notes From the Underground, Farewell , Breaking Point, The BEst Of Clan Of Xymox and the latest DVD release Visible ( 2008) which serve to define what Clan of Xymox has become now - a velvet lined room smelling of roses and clove, the distant chime of crystal engaging crystal, and the slow lilting line of smoke forming nameless shapes as it draws you ever in.\n\nCurrent Lineup:\nRonny Moorings - words, guitar, piano, voice\nMojca Zugna - bass, voice\n\nYvonne de Ray - keyboards\nMario Usai - guitar\n\nDiscography (sans singles)\nSubsequent Pleasures LP 1984\nClan of Xymox 1985\nMedusa 1986\nTwist of Shadows 1989\nPhoenix 1991\nMetamorphosis 1992\nHeadclouds 1993\nSubsequent Pleasures 1994\nOut of the Rain EP 1997\nHidden Faces 1997\nCreatures 1999\nLive 2000\nNotes from the Underground 2001\nRemixes from the Underground 2001\nFarewell 2003\nThe Best of Clan of Xymox 2004\nBreaking Point 2006\nHeroes single 2008\nVisible DVD 2008", "otherInfo": "Clan of Xymox at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "398 12th St., San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Spit Roast", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.41342, 37.769983], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "S.F.

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing, and performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dance floor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 10 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark and sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, \"The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best, and for me this is the new wave in house music.\" He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater\u2019s booty shake. Growing up in Washington DC, Worthy was inspired by the early American rave scene. Upon moving to New York in the late 90\u2019s, he was exposed to artists like LTJ Bukem and Stacey Pullen whose music inspired him to play records across multiple genres, from techno and breaks to hiphop and drum n\u2019 bass. In 2001 he swapped coastlines, moving to San Francisco to pursue his music career. There he teamed up with Claude Von Stroke and Justin and Christian Martin, becoming one of the four founding fathers of the Dirtybird party, Worthy\u2019s breakout track, Irst Te, released on the Dirtybird label in 2007, quickly established his notoriety as a producer. With other bangers like Shy Look, Tric Trac (co-produced with Eats Everything) and the recently release track, Dip, Worthy has been rocking the \u201cDirtybird\u201d sound for nearly a decade now. Concurrently, Worthy has established his own label, Anabatic Records, which has allowed him to be a bit more experimental with his production, and expand his reach as an artist. Some of the songs that have charted on sites such as Beatport include Concubia, Work The Walls, and Flashin. In 2014 Worthy released his debut full-length album, Disbehave, a genre-defying rebellion against the house producers status quo. Breaking down rules and boundaries, Worthy has sought to set himself apart from the mundane world of expectation, striking out to release something unexpected. Disbehave was accepted with critical acclaim and received notable press attention. Early Spring 2015, Worthy will release a two part remix album of Disbehave with artists including Thugfucker, Stanton Warriors, Yolanda be Cool, Matt Tolfrey, and a slough of other amazing producers. He is also back with another Dirtybird release called \"So Delicious\", among other tracks that will be due out later this year. listen to tracks here: www.soundcloud.com/worthy See my Tour dates in the About Section", "otherInfo": "A special event welcoming global superstars Gorgon City.

They got a gig together one night at a tiny club in Oakland, and everyone there seemed to think their music was too weird. It didn't matter to them though. They immediately became close friends, and eventually brothers. They formed a partnership and decided to start throwing their own weird events in San Francisco that would cater to other like minded weirdos. They worked their asses off, and just kept booking more and more of their favorite weirdos.

Then the guitar comes out and kicks the show into an even higher gear with songs about the bright future (and dark past) of babies and what he would do if he woke up one morning as an actual woman.\n\nOn stage, Phil\u2019s playful humor and likeable, endearing manner allow him to shake things up without antagonizing the audience.

Her voice and songs can be heard on Christian and Country Music Radio, in the U.S. and overseas, including the UK, France, Australia, and Germany. She has been invited to perform on world stages, including the 2010 AA World Convention in San Antonio, TX, with over 60,000 people in attendance. \"When my life hit bottom over a decade ago, I felt lost, confused, and wondered why I was even breathing. But at my lowest point was where I discovered I was a songwriter! I'd never been taught how to write songs... and all these songs just started coming because of the pain I was in... songwriting became my therapy and my connection with God. As far back as I can remember, I have always LOVED singing. I sang all the time as a youngster (I'm sure I drove my parents crazy!)... I knew just about every song on Country Radio in the 70's and 80's, as well as those 50's and 60's Rock/Pop hits on my mom's old albums. But life can take its toll after a while, and sometimes what we're meant to do in life can bring the most heartache and pain. I quit singing for almost 10 years in my young adulthood, a result of getting made fun by listeners and friends. It was a sad time in my life... and I take full responsibility... It was my fault... I chose to listen to the negative voices in my life, instead of listening to my own heart. I was also suffering from scars and buried pain from severe abuse I endured earlier in my teens, and I struggled to find my identity. When my life hit bottom in my late twenties, a friend of mine invited me to a 12-step recovery group, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I had a glimmer of hope. I realized I was here on planet earth for a reason. I also realized God wasn't mad at me, but rather, He loved me, He wanted to help me, and had a plan for my life. As I began to get real and face the pain in my past and present, one day at a time, I began to discover a new purpose for my life. The leader of this 12-step recovery group asked me if I would share one of the new songs I had recently started writing. I was scared beyond words, but I sang my heart out one night in front of about 150 people. I became the Music Leader at that 12-step recovery group in Central California, and a dream that had always existed in my heart... to sing and play guitar... became a reality. God was restoring what I was meant to have, and I realized I was born to do this! I've been playing and singing at 12-step recovery programs (i.e. Celebrate Recovery), rescue missions, Teen Challenge events, coffee houses, fairs, music venues, women's events, and churches since 2001. I have been amazed to see God bring hope and encouragement to others' lives through my songs... the very songs that have helped bring tremendous healing to my own life. In 2016, we (my husband, Dennis, who is my road manager, drummer, and has also worked the 12 steps for his struggle with alcoholism), continue to share our lives and music with others. We are truly grateful and living proof that broken lives and broken people can be restored... there is always hope when God is on the scene.\" Heather's song \"Close Your Eyes\" was officially released nationwide and overseas in September 2010. It is still receiving airplay from Country Music Radio stations world-wide, and at one time was playing over 2000 times per week in the United States alone. \"Back Roads\" was released as a single in the Spring of 2011 to the UK, and landed at #20 on the Country Music Charts. Heather's music can be found on her website, under the \"Music\" Tab, iTunes, and Amazon.com. Check out Heather's song \"AMAZING GRACE\"... inspired by stories from female inmates who have endured the shame and regret of prostitution. The song can be heard under the \"Music\" tab at www.heatherlayne.com. Heather Layne's music reflects her life journey... \"I write out of my own life experiences... I also write songs about the lives of those around me... we all have a story. I believe music has a way of expressing the thoughts and feelings of thousands of people at one time, in one song. For me, that's what songwriting is all about... taking life's ups and downs and creating a song that can encourage someone else. We all need to know that we're not alone... we all need to know that there is someone out there who understands.\" - See more at: http://www.heatherlayne.com \"Heather Layne is a gift to the Body of Christ. Her message and music has become a bridge, helping those who are broken to find healing. Her ability to minister hope to both the church and the secular is real, candid and refreshing.\" - Pastors Bruce and Dori Bannister, Hillside Christian Fellowship, Hollister, CA \"Heather's music touches you. Jesus comes and sits with you through her songs. You know that there is a God of love and compassion who cares for you. Then, you look around at the people who are listening, crying, and being healed. Because Jesus changes everything, He can take the mess and make His message out of it.

Mike is always smiling. He is honest and expresses his feelings openly, probably because he is a Capricorn. Surrounded by the inspiration from his favorite tour locations, this California native maintains a blend of laid back coastal attitude, hustle of the big city life, drive of Silicon Valley, and refinement and sophistication of wine country. Mike started playing guitar and writing songs as a child. After the encouragement from friends throughout his high school and college days, he formed and fronted several bands. He discovered his passion in life on a stage performing original music. He is not the typical Polytechnic University graduate who landed a tech job in Silicon Valley, rather he sewed his roots and paved a path with a musical career. Mike wrote and independently released The One (2016), Mike Annuzzi (2013), and Paradise (2012). In 2013, Mike was chosen West Coast Songwriters International Song Contest Singer/Songwriter of the Year for his single, \u201cPay No Mind.\u201d He also received Honorable Mention for \u201cYou Make Me Fall.\u201d Mike's first single \u201cParadise\u201d was chosen as West Coast Songwriters San Francisco\u2019s Song of the Year in 2010.

He finds himself grateful to have a career around his passion and knows it is attributed to the support of his family, friends, and fans. Mike is always looking forward, developing his craft as a songwriter and performer, and sharing his positive energy and passion at live shows.

Chris Rosi and Corey Cunningham had become friends when the pair toured together in their bands Plateaus and Terry Malts in 2011. By 2015 both had moved to Los Angeles where they began the band in earnest with Rosi on guitar and Cunningham on bass. After getting their sea legs playing the bars and bowling alleys of Southern California, the duo recruited engineer/drummer Jon Greene to help them commit their shambolic paeans to kiwi pop onto tape. Recorded in a disused dairy factory and mixed in mono, their self-titled debut came out on Cunningham\u2019s label Parked In Hell in February of 2017 and was reissued by Spain\u2019s Meritorio Records later that summer.\n\nAfter the passing of Jon Greene, the pair re-grouped with drummer Brice Bradley and bassist Jenny Moffett, a move that enabled Cunningham to switch to lead guitar and keyboards. The group worked tirelessly, nurturing their sound and writing batches of songs with steadfast dedication. They soon decamped to Primitive Ears, a small studio in North Hollywood, where they tracked the 10 songs that make up \u201cUsed To Yesterday.\u201d After a handful of quicksilver sessions, the group brought the tapes to producer Kyle Mullarky (The Allah-lahs) who created a final mix that really captures the band\u2019s rhythmic drive and melodic verve.\n\n\u201cUsed To Yesterday\u201d continues Smokescreen\u2019s zeal for New Zealand pop but also incorporates influences from the more melodic side of Messthetics-era DIY pop and expands into classic indie pop territory, a natural fit for the group\u2019s new label Slumberland Records. First single \u201cThe Lost Song\u201d perfectly encapsulates where the band is coming from on this new record; literally a lost demo from the group\u2019s earliest days, it is here given a NZ-meets-Athens GA arrangement, galloping along at an urgent clip and packed with guitars that strum and jangle in magical unison.\n\nWhere Smokescreens really excel is in the quality of their songwriting and the ability to incorporate a disparate set of influences while still forging their own sound and identity. The song \u201cUsed To Yesterday\u201d is classic power-pop, riding a chunky three chord riff and leavened by a bright, clanging lead. Elsewhere we find nods to The Velvet Underground (\u201cFool Me\u201d), The Clean (\u201cSomeone New\u201d) and SF\u2019s beloved The Aislers Set (\u201cWaiting For Summer\u201d). Smokescreens are such skilled writers and keen students of sound that their cover of the \u00fcber-obscure NZ band Wasp Factory\u2019s \u201cSteel Blue Skies\u201d fits in seamlessly. Album closer \u201cFalling Down\u201d could be a lost single from LA\u2019s paisley underground and definitely leaves the listener itching to hear where the band goes next.", "otherInfo": "Slumberland Records 30th Anniversary Celebration!!\n2 pm doors\n$12 adv / $15 doors"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Tony Molina", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Pop Punk, Pop, Indie, Alternative, Punk", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Slumberland Records 30th Anniversary Celebration!!\n2 pm doors\n$12 adv / $15 doors"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Papercuts", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6268209.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Indie Pop, Pop, Indie", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "Papercuts are a soft indie pop project centered around Jason Robert Quever, who was brought up in a commune in Humboldt County, CA.

A band that was started as an off-season fun experiment has become a full-time dream team of players and singers.\n\nThe band, recorded or live, move dynamically from well chosen, hard-hitting neo-traditional covers of classic songs to new material curated by a band with a perfect sense of who they are and what they have to say.

Initially working under the name \u2018Hearing Is Our Concern\u2019, he was actually the first person the newly-founded FatCat label ever received a demo from. We talked with him for a while about putting a release out, but Olivier wanted to work further on his tracks and in the end nothing happened. The name was changed to Ensemble and a chance meeting with Rephlex Records in 2000 resulted in the release of his first album, \u2018Sketch Proposals\u2019.\n\nWhile not widely released, \u2018Sketch Proposals\u2019 did gain a small, dedicated audience, not least of which included Bjork, who had the album on heavy rotation while working on her 2001 album \u2018Vespertine\u2019. We put Olivier in touch with her and in 2002, Ensemble\u2019s remixes of Bjork\u2019s \u2018Sun In My Mouth\u2019 and \u2018Cocoon\u2019 were released as b-sides. Their collaborative relationship eventually led to Olivier\u2019s co-writing of the song \u2018Desired Constellation\u2019 on Bjork\u2019s 2004 album \u2018Medulla\u2019, and still more remixes on the \u2018triumph of a heart\u2019 single.\n\nAround this time, Olivier continued work on a follow-up to \u2018Sketch Proposals\u2019, aiming to collide symphonic walls-of-sound with intimate folk-pop vocal pieces. Recorded over a period of 3 years, and composed mainly in Montreal, where he now resides, Olivier travelled from Canada, to Atlanta, then to a countryside farm in French Dordogne, and finally to Berlin for his recordings, with each disparate environment absorbed into the moods of each track. Expanding on his collaborative spirit, 2006\u2019s new album (\u2018Ensemble\u2019) features beautiful vocal performances by Chan Marshall (Cat Power), Lou Barlow (Dinosaur Jr.) and UK-based Mileece, as well as drums by Adam Pierce from Mice Parade and orchestral arrangements by Johannes Malfatti, performed by the Babelsberg Film Orchestra in Germany.\n\nOlivier has also composed music for several exhibitions at the V&A museum; contributed to an Audio-Video installation by Doug Aitken at the Centre Georges Pompidou; and received an honorary mention at the Ars Electronica Festival for his noise side project, Chlorgeschlecht.", "otherInfo": "In 2020, E4TT performs our annual commissions concert on International Women's Day.

Davina Sowers and the Vagabonds have created a stir on the national music scene with their high-energy live shows, level A musicianship, sharp-dressed professionalism, and Sowers\u2019 commanding stage presence. With influences ranging from Fats Domino and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to Aretha Franklin and Tom Waits, the band is converting audiences one show at a time, from Vancouver to Miami and across Europe. In 2011 Davina released her first full length, all original album Black Cloud . It was named one of the 10 best releases of the year by the Minneapolis Star & Tribune and awarded 4 \u00bd stars from Downbeat Magazine. Their next release in 2014, Sunshine, hit number 13 in the Billboard Blues Chart and led them to be a musicial feature on the hit BBC show, Later with Jools Holland. DATV\u2019s shows are filled with New Orleans charm, Memphis soul swagger, dark theatrical moments that evoke Kurt Weill, and tender gospel passages. Davina\u2019s voice and stage presence defy category in a different way. Davina has been compared to Etta James, Amy Winehouse, Janis Joplin, Billie Holiday and Betty Boop, but comparisons don\u2019t suffice: Sowers is a true original. Bringing you 100 years of American music and Davina\u2019s originals, which lend themselves to the American Songbook, the band brings edgy nostalgia to older generations and fresh new music to younger ears. This rollicking quintet is held together by Sowers\u2019 keyboard playing, with acoustic bass, drums, and a spicy trumpet and trombone horn section. The group\u2019s focused, clean sound and emphasis on acoustic instruments is novel to both blues and jazz worlds, and sets the show closer to New Orleans than to Chicago. This has set the Vagabonds apart at festivals in Thunder Bay, Ontario; Sighisoara, Romania; Sierre, Switzerland; Kemi, Finland; the 2012 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and 2013 Monterey Jazz Festival ( in 2014 was asked back to play their main stage in 2014, Vache de Blues in France, and North Sea Jazz Festival.

After years of dishonest living\u2014consumed by drugs, alcohol, and addiction\u2014such sincerity is jarring from the 30-year-old Chicago-based musician. Liberated from a self-destructive past and born anew in sobriety, Francis has captured an inspired collection of songs steeped in New Orleans rhythms and Chicago blues. His music evokes a bygone era of R&B\u2019s heyday while simultaneously forging a new path on the musical landscape. Ohio-based Karma Chief Records (a subsidiary of rising soul label Colemine Records) will release two songs, \u201cThese Are The Days\u201d and \u201cChanges, Pt. 1,\u201d in early 2019 with the full LP to follow in summer 2019.\n\nThere is a deep connection between Francis\u2019s childhood\u2014his obsession with boogie woogie piano, his father\u2019s gift of a dusty Dr. John LP\u2014and the songs he\u2019s created. The result is an astonishing collection of material without parallel in the contemporary funk and soul scene. The influences are unmistakable: the vocal stylings of Allen Toussaint and Leon Russell; the second line rhythms of The Meters and Dr. John; the barroom rock \u2018n\u2019 roll of The Rolling Stones; the gospel soul of Billy Preston; the roots music of The Band. Francis pays tribute to the masters but has his own story to tell: \u201cIt\u2019s the life I\u2019ve lived so far.\u201d\n\nAnd what a life it\u2019s been. Born Neal Francis O\u2019Hara, the piano prodigy found himself touring Europe by the age of 18 with Muddy Waters\u2019 son and backing up other prominent blues artists coast-to-coast. In 2012, Francis joined popular instrumental funk band The Heard. With Francis at the creative helm, The Heard transformed into a national act, touring with boogaloo progenitors The New Mastersounds and chart toppers The Revivalists and appearing at Jazz Fest and Bear Creek. As The Heard\u2019s star rose, however, Francis sunk deeper into addiction. Once a promising sideman, by 2015 he had been fired from his band, evicted from his apartment, and was perilously close to self-destruction. \u201cWhen you get close to death like that you can feel it,\u201d Francis recalls. An alcohol-induced seizure that year led to a broken femur, dislocated arm, and, finally, the realization that he needed to get clean.\n\nThe journey from a hospital bed to launching his solo career was neither predictable nor straightforward. There were musical fits and starts, relapses, and broken relationships. Yet the overwhelming passion driving Francis in this second act has been an overabundance of creative energy. \u201cDrinking held my music in a half-cocked slingshot. I was always so consumed by drugs and alcohol that I didn\u2019t have the time, money, or creative energy to do it. Sobriety let it loose.\u201d\n\nDetermined to realize the songs swirling in his head, Francis assembled a crack team of musicians, calling on bassist Mike Starr (The Heard) and drummer PJ Howard (The Revivalists, The Heard). He linked up with producer and analog-obsessive Sergio Rios (Orgone, Cee Lo Green, Alicia Keys) and self-funded a trip to Killion Sound in Los Angeles to record the initial batch of material. \u201cI learned to trust my instincts in that room,\u201d says Francis. Buoyed by classic horn arrangements and Rios\u2019 fierce guitar work, the resulting tracks illuminate a lifetime spent studying the masters of soul music.\n\nFrom the RMI electra-piano riff that kicks off \u201cShe\u2019s A Winner\u201d to the screaming organ swells of \u201cThis Time,\u201d Francis and company let it all hang out. This is fun music, dance music. Yet verse after verse and chorus after chorus, Francis wrestles with his past in a straightforward manner: \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I\u2019m not home/ I\u2019m surrounded by people, but I\u2019m really alone.\u201d Like Toussaint and Russell before him he\u2019s married the upbeat rhythms of New Orleans R&B with the lyrical approach of a confessional singer/songwriter. The refrain on \u201cThis Time\u201d serves as a foxhole prayer for a better future: \u201cLet me get it this time/I won\u2019t let you down/Let me get it this time/I won\u2019t fool around.\u201d\n\n2018 has been a busy year. In February Francis finished recording basic tracks for the yet-to-be named debut album in Los Angeles and spent the following months doing overdubs in Chicago with engineer Mike Novak (who also recorded demos for the project). After playing his first show in November, Francis was signed by Paradigm Talent Agency. He is now preparing to tour relentlessly to promote his own music. \u201cI\u2019m doing this to fulfill a drive within myself, but also to pay tribute to the gifts I\u2019ve been given. And it comes from a place of immense gratitude. I\u2019ve been given so much in my life, especially in the last two years, that this feels like a bonus.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Free Throw", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9008522.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Emo, Punk, Indie", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "After two studio albums and nearly seven years as a band, Free Throw is making a significant change to their identity. The group \u2014 who has sung openly of personal struggles related to substance abuse and body image \u2014 is holding nothing back on What\u2019s Past is Prologue, their third full length record, due out March 29, 2019 on Triple Crown Records.\n\nPast releases may have provided small glimpses into Free Throw\u2019s history as a band and personal lives outside of music, but What\u2019s Past is Prologue is the group at their most forthcoming. The 12 tracks contained on the album detail the continuing mental health struggles of lead singer Cory Castro, and serve as a complete story of what happens when you decide that everything in your life needs to change.\n\n\u201cThis album is very much about me hitting rock bottom from a mental health standpoint and the process I took in building myself back up,\u201d Castro explained. \u201cWith the last record, I was trying to talk about my mental health, but at the time I was actually going through it. The last album felt like I was yelling from the void. This time I\u2019m looking back into the void and I\u2019m able to understand what was going on.\u201d\n\nThe beautiful anguish that often comes with personal growth and an unexpected reckoning of self is palpable from the album\u2019s outset. Beginning with \u201cSmokes, Let\u2019s Go\u201d \u2014 a track of transition that features surprisingly delicate vocals and simple strings switches to impassioned shouts and furious instrumentals \u2014 Free Throw lead us out of the darkness and into the light.\n\nAs Castro explains, the record is split into two parts. The first half of What\u2019s Past is Prologue explores the weight of personal blame, with singles \u2014 including the gunning and practically unstoppable \u201cTail Whip, Struggle\u201d and the limitless, swaying tenderness of \u201cStay Out Of The Basement\u201d \u2014 setting the stage for an impactful finale. As the album nears its conclusion, \u201cToday Is Especially Delicious\u201d provides a tumultuous turning point, with the band tearing through Castro\u2019s shouted confession of \u201cIs this what I had planned for my life/I need a hand of some type to pull me up and break this cycle of drinking for breakfast.\u201d\n\nThat frank sincerity propels the album forward, and serves as a catalyst of change for the band. As a group, Free Throw has consistently turned their darkest days into moments that fans can sing and dance-along to, and for the first time, the band has arrived at this place where it\u2019s all coming together, and maybe this is really only just the beginning. \u201cThis is the first Free Throw record with a happy ending,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThe album leads to an ending of where the band stands today. We\u2019re all happy to be doing what we\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s kind of the happy moment where we\u2019ve become the band we were always meant to be.\u201d", "otherInfo": "The Wonder Years"}, {"Address": "1984 Bonita Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Diana Rowan", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272093, 37.871966], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Back Room Music", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Celebrate International Women's Day with True Life Trio & Diana Rowan"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Nancy Wright", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "General Admission."}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Guest", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8275393.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "There are 2 Bands that have the name \"Guest\" :\n\n1) Guest is a duo of two siblings, Brittany and Brandon Hargest (formally of Jump5).

William Reames and Willard Logan both picked up the guitar at an early age, took lessons from the same teacher in town, went to the same school, and even played in the same middle school band together.\n\nA shared love for bluegrass, folk, and singer/songwriter music sparked a different musical friendship for Reames between him and banjo player, Barton Davies. Before long, the two youngsters enthusiastically bounced songs off each other and discovered some of their favorite bands like The Steel Drivers, John Hartford, and The Infamous Stringdusters together. In no time at all, they were writing and performing songs of their own, an at the age of 16, they formed their own band. Only, they needed a mandolin player. That's when they called Logan - and the two longtime friends, and now, Davies, were bandmates once again.\n\n\"We were still too young to step foot inside a bar when we first started to play,\" Davies recalls, \"so we'd set up shop on the sidewalk outside of Robert's Western World in downtown Nashville and play our own songs for whomever would listen.\" According to Davies - about halfway through one of their sets, a man came stumbling out of Robert's, got in Barton's face and yelled \"play that thing, Banjo Boy! Faster now, ya hear? C'mon, Banjo!\"\n\nReames texted Davies later that night - \"Boy Named Banjo.\"\n\nWith a brand new band name and a bunch of original songs, the trio recorded The Tanglewood Sessions, an honest, emotional, roots-driven look into the lives of the young outfit. Unexpectedly, the debut album was received quite well and now has over 3 million streams on Spotify.\n\nIn 2013, BNB invited drummer Sam McCullough to join the group, before recording its sophomore album, Long Story Short (2014). The band got its first breakthrough by earning a spot on the 2015 Bonnaroo lineup, which led to some hometown love for the native Nashvillians, including a nomination for Best Local Band by The Tennesseean. Shortly after releasing Lost on Main EP in 2015, Boy Named Banjo found its missing piece - Ford Garrard (bass), hit the road, and hasn't stopped touring since.\n\nBoy Named Banjo's sound has grown up alongside them into an energetic blend of rock, folk-pop, and alt-country that will keep listeners smiling, clapping, and dancing along for many years to come.

She was influential in the birth of punk rock with her 1975 debut album Horses which was produced by John Cale. Called \"Godmother of Punk\" she integrated the beat poetry performance style with three-chord rock. Smith is most widely known for the song Because the Night, which was co-written with Bruce Springsteen and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978. In 2005 Patti Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, and in 2007 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nSmith was born in Chicago. Her mother, Beverly, was a jazz singer, and father, Grant, worked at the Honeywell plant. She spent her entire childhood in Woodbury, New Jersey. Raised the daughter of a Jehovah's Witness mother, she claims she had a strong religious education and a very good Bible education, but left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining and much later wrote the opening line of her cover version of Them's \"Gloria\" in response to this experience. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964. The family was not wealthy and Smith went to work in a factory.\n\nIn 1967 she left Glassboro State Teachers College (now Rowan University) and moved to New York City. She met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe there while working at a book store with friend, poet Janet Hamill. Mapplethorpe's photographs of her became the covers for the Patti Smith Group LPs, and they remained friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989. In 1969 she went to Paris with her sister and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to New York City, she lived in the Hotel Chelsea with Mapplethorpe; they frequented the fashionable Max's Kansas City and CBGB nightclubs. The same year Smith appeared with Wayne County in Jackie Curtis's play \"Femme Fatale\". As a member of the St. Mark's Poetry Project, she spent the early '70s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed \u2013 for one night only \u2013 in Sam Shepard's \"Cowboy Mouth\". (The published play's notes call for \"a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow\".) She collaborated with Allen Lanier of Blue \u00d6yster Cult, who recorded several of the songs to which Smith had contributed, including \"Debbie Denise\" (after her poem \"In Remembrance of Debbie Denise\"), \"Career of Evil\", \"Fire of Unknown Origin\", \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\", and \"Shooting Shark\". During these years, Smith also wrote rock journalism, some of which was published in Creem magazine.\n\nBy 1974 Patti Smith was performing rock music herself, initially with guitarist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and later with a full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl, on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia, fleeing in 1968 after the fall of Alexander Dub\u010dek. Financed by Robert Mapplethorpe, the band recorded a first single, \"Hey Joe / Piss Factory\", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard with the addition of a spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst (\"Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women...\"). The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations.\n\nPatti Smith Group was signed by Clive Davis of Arista Records, and 1975 saw the release of Smith's first album \"Horses\", produced by John Cale amidst some tension. The album fused punk rock and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of Van Morrison's \"Gloria\", and Smith's opening words: \"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine.\" The austere cover photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe has become one of rock's classic images. As Patti Smith Group toured the United States and Europe, punk's popularity grew. The rawer sound of the group's second album, \"Radio Ethiopia\", reflected this. Considerably less accessible than Horses, Radio Ethiopia received poor reviews. However, several of its songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them regularly in concert. On January 23, 1977, while touring in support of the record, Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida and fell 15 feet into a concrete orchestra pit, breaking several neck vertebrae. The injury required a period of rest and an intensive round of physical therapy, during which time she was able to reassess, re-energize and reorganize her life. Patti Smith Group produced two further albums before the end of the 1970s. \"Easter\" (1978) was her most commercially successful record, containing single \"Because the Night\" co-written with Bruce Springsteen. \"Wave\" (1979) was less successful, although songs \"Frederick\" and \"Dancing Barefoot\" both received commercial airplay.\n\nBefore the release of Wave, Smith, now separated from long-time partner Allen Lanier, met Fred Sonic Smith, former guitar player for Detroit rock band MC5 and his own Sonic's Rendezvous Band, who adored poetry as much as she did. (\"Wave\"'s \"Dancing Barefoot\" and \"Frederick\" were both dedicated to him.) The running joke at the time was that she only married Fred because she would not have to change her name. Patti and Fred had a son, Jackson, and later a daughter, Jesse. Through most of the 1980s Patti was in semi-retirement from music, living with her family north of Detroit in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. On June 1988 she released album \"Dream of Life\", which included song \"People Have the Power\". Fred Smith died on November 4, 1994. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the unexpected death of her brother Todd and original keyboard player, Richard Sohl. When her son Jackson turned 21, Smith decided to move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her to go back out on the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe).\n\nIn 1996, Smith worked with her long-time colleagues to record the haunting \"Gone Again\", featuring \"About a Boy\", a tribute to Kurt Cobain. Smith was a fan of Cobain, but was more angered than saddened by his suicide. That same year she collaborated with Stipe on \"E-Bow the Letter,\" a song on R.E.M.'s \"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\", which she has also performed live with the band. After release of \"Gone Again\", Patti Smith has recorded two new albums: \"Peace and Noise\" in 1997 (with the single \"1959\", about the invasion of Tibet) and \"Gung Ho\" in 2000 (with songs about Ho Chi Minh and Smith's late father). A box set of her work up to that time, \"The Patti Smith Masters\", came out in 1996, and 2002 saw the release of \"Land (1975\u20132002)\", a two-CD compilation that includes a memorable cover of Prince's \"When Doves Cry\". Smith's solo art exhibition, \"Strange Messenger\" was hosted at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh on September 28, 2002.\n\nOn April 27, 2004 Patti Smith released \"Trampin'\" which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith's mother who died two years before. Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of \"Horses\" in its entirety. Guitarist Tom Verlaine took Oliver Ray's place. This live performance was released later in the year as \"Horses/Horses\". In August 2005 Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Arthur Rimbaud and William Blake. On July 10, 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In addition to her influence on rock music, Minister also noted Smith's appreciation of Arthur Rimbaud. On October 15, 2006, Patti Smith performed at CBGB nightclub, with a 3\u00bd-hour tour de force to close out Manhattan's music venue. She took the stage at 9:30 p.m. (EDT) and closed for the night (and forever for the venue) at a few minutes after 1:00 a.m., performing her song \"Elegie\", and finally reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years.\n\nSmith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame March 12, 2007. She dedicated her award to the memory of her late husband, Fred, and gave a performance of The Rolling Stones classic \"Gimme Shelter\". As the closing number of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Smith's \"People Have the Power\" was used for the big celebrity jam that always ends the program. From March 28 to June 22, 2008 the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain in Paris is hosting a major exhibition of the visual work of Patti Smith, \"Land 250\", drawn from pieces created between 1967 and 2007. At the 2008 Rowan Commencement ceremony, Smith received an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture. Smith is the subject of a 2008 documentary film, \"Patti Smith: Dream of Life\".\n\nwww.pattismith.net\nMySpace", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Monday February 24"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "The Grease Traps", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1025 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "A Bowie Celebration", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9394900.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.415665, 37.803702], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bimbo's 365 Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Jose, CA", "Artist": "J.Stalin", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.8261, 37.2751], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Back Bar Sofa", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors: 9:00 pm / Show: 10:00 pm, 21+"}, {"Address": "119 Utah St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Frankie Fictitious", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9164562.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.406803, 37.768186], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Great Northern", "moreBioInfo": "Frankie Fictitious is a World Famous Award-Winning Burlesque Sensation based in San Francisco, California\n\n\"Miss Exotic World 2019\" - Burlesque Hall Of Fame\n\"Most Dazzling 2019\" - Burlesque Hall of Fame\nTop 50 Burlesque Industry Figures - 21st Century Burlesque\n\"Miss Viva Las Vegas 2017\" - Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekend\n\"Best Burlesque 2017\" - Arizona Burlesque Festival\n\u201cBest Small Group 2017\u201d- Burlesque Hall of Fame", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Rotciv", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Return Of The Cypher (No Cover) Hip Hop, Bands, Rap Battles"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Gemstone", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Return Of The Cypher (No Cover) Hip Hop, Bands, Rap Battles"}, {"Address": "San Jose, CA", "Artist": "Keak da Sneak", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.8261, 37.2751], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Back Bar Sofa", "moreBioInfo": "Keak Da Sneak (full name Charles \"Kunta\" Kinte Bowens commonly referred to as Keak) is a rapper from Oakland, California.

That was reinstated at the Iceland Music Awards that took place on February 20th, Asgeir making an impressive sweep of the board, picking up Best Pop/Rock Album, Best Newcomer, Icelandicmusic.com Award for online achievement and the Public Choice Award.

In Iceland, the unusual poetry of lyrics have attracted almost as much attention as the music itself, in part because they are mostly written by \u00c1sgeir\u2019s 72 year old father. The songs themselves, however, are all \u00c1sgeir: light and airy, inset with his distinctive melancholic voice their vibrancy elevates their appeal way beyond the folktronica tag.

They had new ideas on how to explore and develop their music. After some member hunting and rehearsals CoL had its first line-up consisting of: Klas Rydberg, Johannes Persson, Magnus Lindberg, Erik Olofsson and Fredrik Renstrom. After a short period of time, Fredrik had to leave due to some personal difficulties.\n\nWhen practice started to pay off, CoL recorded a two-track demo in January 1999. After some more rehearsals, the band felt that to fully live out their wet dream of sound experimenting, an additional member was needed to handle the electronics. Since Magnus had both knowledge and equipment, he was an obvious choice. Given that Magnus had handled the drums earlier they needed a new drummer, who they found in the mutual friend Marco Hilden. A new bass player was also found, named Axel Stattin. Another mutual friend helped CoL release their first record. Tim Bertilsson, head of Trust No One Recordings released a 7\" split vinyl with his own band Switchblade.\n\nWatching a concert at the Trastock Festival, year 2000, UK label Rage of Achilles got in contact with CoL. Pretty soon after that it was agreed that RoA was to release CoL's debut full-length album. Release date was September 14th 2001. In these days Hydra Head Records had also shown interest in CoL, and this co-operation resulted in a two-track 7\" colored vinyl on HHR, released March 24th 2002. These two songs were recorded at the same time as the self titled full-length on RoA. Immediately after the release of the first album, news of the band's mammoth sound worked its way into cult circles and the band received rave reviews. Discerning listeners instantly appreciated the bands unique approach, trading light and dark to create music that hit the heart and the head in equal measures.\n\nAfter the success of the first album, Earache Records contacted CoL and wanted to sign a record deal. After some negotiations CoL finally signed the contract. Immediately after that CoL entered Tonteknik Recording studios, in July 2002, to record their second album The Beyond. After the recording session Andreas Johansson joined in on bass, due to the departure of Axel Stattin. The Beyond was released February 10th 2003, to critical acclaim. CoL proved that they were now ready to bring their soundscapes to a much wider audience. After the release of The Beyond, CoL toured Sweden with The Haunted and the UK with Isis. After this the line up changed, drummer Marco Hilden was replaced by Thomas Hedlund and an additional keyboard player, Anders Teglund, was added as a permanent fixture. Magnus took care of the percussion and additional guitar parts.\n\nAt this point touring became a lot more frequent. Late summer 2003 CoL ventured into Europe with US hardcore sensations Poison the Well, to amazing press reactions. In December the same year CoL returned to the UK for a tour with art noise merchants The Dillinger Escape Plan. The early part of 2004 was mostly dedicated to writing songs for their follow up to The Beyond. They found the time to play a few long awaited shows in Sweden and Finland, before entering Tonteknik Recording studios once again in April 2004.\n\nThe recording of Salvation was done in three different sessions, thus enabling the band to take some rest and think about possible changes that needed to be done. Finally, in late July 2004 the album was complete. Salvation was released October 4th 2004 in Europe and Oct 19th in the US. This album marked a new era in the history of CoL, both visually and sonically. At the same time as Salvation was hitting the stores, CoL embarked on a Europe/UK headline tour, which also included Scandinavian dates. This tour introduced a new member, Fredrik Kihlberg, who joined in on percussion and clean vocals.\n\n2005 was perhaps the most interesting year so far in the history of CoL. It started with a six week European tour, partly with American hardcore act Bleeding Through and partly by their own. This tour also saw a change in the live line-up. As Thomas couldn\u0092t participate due to being busy playing with other bands, Magnus took over the live drumming. When the band came home they had the time to rest for about a month before departing to the US for the first tour over there. CoL supported the mighty Mastodon on the first leg of the tour, and headlined eight shows (supported by Breather Resist) on the latter part. The reception of the American audience was stunningly good for a first ever tour in the US. After the US-tour CoL did some Scandinavian and European festival shows before starting to work on the 4th full-length album Somewhere Along The Highway.\n\nIn November 2005 CoL began the recording of Somewhere Along The Highway. The first session was located to an old octagon barn ten minutes west of Umea. The vibe out there was perfect and seven days were spent there recording basic tracks. After some more sessions in the studio environment, Magnus mixed the last song in January 2006. Somewhere Along The Highway was released April 24th 2006 on Earache Records, followed by a European/UK headline tour.", "otherInfo": "Cult of Luna"}, {"Address": "255 S Almaden Blvd, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Il volo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7166897.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.89192, 37.33001], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "Genres: International, Italian, Progressive Rock, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "San Jose Center for the Performing Arts", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "65 Capp St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Andrea von Kampen", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8182577.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418409, 37.765783], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Folk Revival, Americana, Traditional Folk, Acousic, Indie, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lost Church", "moreBioInfo": "\"We were completely blown away.\" -NPR All Songs Considered\n\nAndrea von Kampen is an independent folk singer-songwriter based in Lincoln, Nebraska, whose effortless vocal delivery has been praised by Hear Nebraska as \u201csoulful and worn-in.\u201d With the successful release of two EP\u2019s, Another Day (2015) and Desdemona (2016), a Christmas EP (2016), an Audiotree Live album (2017), and her debut full-length album Old Country (2019), Andrea has quickly established herself in the recording studio and on the road.

The album was recorded and mastered in Nebraska and features exclusively Nebraska-based musicians. Inspiration for Andrea\u2019s songs often come from literature, art, and nature; in particular the literature and nature of Nebraska and the Midwest. The title track, Old Country, is based on the book \u201cMy \u00c1ntonia\u201d by Nebraska author Willa Cather.\nHer single, Portland, received notable attention including features on The Bluegrass Situation, Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. Additionally, Amazon Music Canada featured Portland in their \u2018Top Songs of 2018\u2019 playlist. In a review of Portland, Ear To The Ground Music said, \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about where you\u2019re going, but that you want to get away. That emotion of \u201cidealistic escapism\u201d is one that listeners can all connect with, whether or not we want to go to Oregon or somewhere else.

Within 24 hours of submission, NPR Music, All Songs Considered tweeted her video as the featured artist of the day, saying \u201cwe were completely blown away.\u201d Ultimately, Andrea finished the competition as a top ten finalist, which lead to the increased popularity of her EP, Another Day, specifically her song Trainsong.

William Reames and Willard Logan both picked up the guitar at an early age, took lessons from the same teacher in town, went to the same school, and even played in the same middle school band together.\n\nA shared love for bluegrass, folk, and singer/songwriter music sparked a different musical friendship for Reames between him and banjo player, Barton Davies. Before long, the two youngsters enthusiastically bounced songs off each other and discovered some of their favorite bands like The Steel Drivers, John Hartford, and The Infamous Stringdusters together. In no time at all, they were writing and performing songs of their own, an at the age of 16, they formed their own band. Only, they needed a mandolin player. That's when they called Logan - and the two longtime friends, and now, Davies, were bandmates once again.\n\n\"We were still too young to step foot inside a bar when we first started to play,\" Davies recalls, \"so we'd set up shop on the sidewalk outside of Robert's Western World in downtown Nashville and play our own songs for whomever would listen.\" According to Davies - about halfway through one of their sets, a man came stumbling out of Robert's, got in Barton's face and yelled \"play that thing, Banjo Boy! Faster now, ya hear? C'mon, Banjo!\"\n\nReames texted Davies later that night - \"Boy Named Banjo.\"\n\nWith a brand new band name and a bunch of original songs, the trio recorded The Tanglewood Sessions, an honest, emotional, roots-driven look into the lives of the young outfit. Unexpectedly, the debut album was received quite well and now has over 3 million streams on Spotify.\n\nIn 2013, BNB invited drummer Sam McCullough to join the group, before recording its sophomore album, Long Story Short (2014). The band got its first breakthrough by earning a spot on the 2015 Bonnaroo lineup, which led to some hometown love for the native Nashvillians, including a nomination for Best Local Band by The Tennesseean. Shortly after releasing Lost on Main EP in 2015, Boy Named Banjo found its missing piece - Ford Garrard (bass), hit the road, and hasn't stopped touring since.\n\nBoy Named Banjo's sound has grown up alongside them into an energetic blend of rock, folk-pop, and alt-country that will keep listeners smiling, clapping, and dancing along for many years to come.

Playing each and every time as if their lives depended on it. If you\u2019ve never seen them live, I urge you to please make the effort. Trust me, it\u2019ll stay with you forever.\n\nSimply, they\u2019re four funny, generous and extremely grounded blokes who still can\u2019t believe their luck and who continually strive for brilliance, but now a decade in it\u2019s time for us to take stock and celebrate just how much their music has shadowed and enriched our daily lives. Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, I give you, the wondrous Keane.\u201d\n\n----\n\nNot many British bands these days have more than one big-selling album, let alone five. Fewer still manage to replicate - and maintain - that success outside the UK. And only a tiny number are able to continually develop their sound as their career progresses. But, in the last decade, Keane have achieved all of those things and a whole lot more. After selling over 11 million copies of their five consecutive Number One records, with their four award winning albums and their 8 track EP \u2018Night Train\u2019, it is no exaggeration to say that Keane are firmly established as one of the world's most successful, innovative and cherished bands.\n\nWhen Keane first got together all those years ago, three of the bands they most admired were the Beatles, Radiohead and Blur. What made all of those acts special was that although nobody could ever predict what they'd do next, you knew it would be worth hearing. Over the release of their five albums that's an exclusive club to which Keane have surely now gained membership.\n\nTracklisting for \u2018The Best Of Keane\u2019 below, revealing the story of one of the biggest bands of the decade;\n\nTrack 1. Everybody\u2019s Changing\n\n1997, Battle, Hastings, seaside small-town England. Keane, a struggling trio from the aptly-named Battle, take five years to be discovered \u201covernight\u201d in December 2002 at the Betsey Trotwood pub, east London, by Simon Williams, founder of the atom-sized though astronomically influential Fierce Panda label. Signed in 2003, that year is dominated by America, a glitzy showbiz caterwaul of Black Eyed Peas, Beyonc\u00e9, Avril Lavigne, Justin Timberlake, Eminem and Christina Aguilera. The quintessentially British Keane, by comparison (also championed by Radio 1's Steve Lamacq) wear their hearts on their vulnerably-fraying sleeves and release debut independent single \u2018Everybody's Changing\u2019 in April 2003 before signing to the mighty Island major and releasing world-class epic piano-rock anthem \u2018Somewhere Only We Know\u2019 in early 2004. Debut album \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019 follows, an instantaneous, British rock phenomenon, a soaring rapture of euphoric melancholy which swathes the planet. A UK No.1 album, Keane bloom in a brand new landscape, a post-Britpop era of emotional sensitivity, which dominates the rest of the decade.\n\n\u201cWe're the post-OK Computer generation,\u201d notes Tim Rice-Oxley, Keane's gifted songwriter, lyricist and pianist, of the '97 Radiohead classic. \u201cFor me, that was the album of our generation. We've grown up appreciating the power of a song that can unlock you. And we're all men, I guess, who probably wouldn't otherwise let go. That's our cornerstone. It's just good to feel you're not alone.\u201d\n\nTrack 2. Somewhere Only We Know\n\n2006-2012, four more albums, four heroically different directions. Post \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019, Keane detonate their own blueprint. Like Blur and Radiohead, they've the confidence to diversify: through \u2018Under The Iron Sea\u2019 (2006, portentous document of splintering inter-band relationships), \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 (2008, ambitious experiment in conscience-rock and glittering electro-pop, recorded in Berlin), the \u2018Night Train\u2019 EP (further sonic experiments and lyrical ennui, recorded on the road) and \u2018Strangeland\u2019 (2012, piano-rock progressions on a rousing, reflective sojourn through human relationships and what it means to be 30-something men). \u2018The Best Of Keane\u2019, therefore, is more than just a greatest hits (and there's plenty of them): a compendium of Classic Keane Anthems plus band favourites, fan favourites, live favourites and two new tracks (\u2018Higher Than the Sun\u2019, \u2018Won't Be Broken\u2019), featuring the stunning hymnal \u2018Hamburg Song\u2019 and the glorious reverie \u2018My Shadow\u2019. To date Keane have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, their five albums to date consecutive UK No.1s.\n\n\u201cI'm very proud of the variety on the \u2018Best Of\u2019,\u201d notes Tim. \u201cYou've got the Keane anthems, then something like \u2018Hamburg Song\u2019 which is deeply emotional. \u2018Atlantic\u2019 is weird, sonically ambitious. Same with \u2018Spiralling\u2019 (voted 2008 Song Of The Year by Q magazine). \u2018Silenced By The Night\u2019 covers my craving for American open highway epic rock songs. It's hasn't just been \u2018Somewhere Only We Know\u2019 times sixteen. There's a lyrical reflection of our lives and the way they've changed, in a really true way.\u201d\n\nTrack 3. Bend and Break\n\n2012, Brazil. Tom Chaplin, a man whose astonishingly powerful archangel vocals puncture the human heart with a shard of purest yearning, awakes in a hotel bed. He's poleaxed, once again, by the malady which typifies the global touring colossus Keane have long become: stratospheric jet lag. \u201cI had literally no sense of self,\u201d he boggles. \u201cI couldn't have told you what my name was, what day it was, what year it was.\u201d\n\nTrack 4. Bedshaped\n\n700 shows in over 40 countries worldwide. Keane have now played in over forty individual countries: America, Russia, South America, Indonesia, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Japan, all across Europe, over and over again. In South Korea they're known as The Autumn Band with all the wistful melancholy, melodic richness and emotional metamorphosis that implies. Their fans unfurl 'Welcome' flags in trees outside their hotels, tattoo their art-work and lyrics on their bodies, hold birthday parties in their honour, in Brazil (when they're not even in Brazil) and send lengthy letters saying their music has \u201csaved my life\u201d. Keane are a universal soul band.\n\nTrack 5. This Is The Last Time\n\n2004, Glastonbury. Newly back from their inaugural tour of America, Keane had left a Britain where their biggest-ever show was at The Forum, Kentish Town (capacity 2,000). \u201cWe got to Glastonbury and 20 thousand people were singing all our songs, it was electrifying,\u201d beams Tim. \u201cBefore that, we had no sense whatsoever what it was like for our music to be everywhere.\u201d\n\nTrack 6. Atlantic\n\n2005, Madison Square Gardens, New York City. Keane support U2 over five nights and Larry Mullen Jnr, shows Keane drummer Richard Hughes how he sets his kit up (with a view to minimising injury). \u201cOne of my absolute heroes,\u201d marvels Rich. \u201cAnd I'm sitting at his drum kit, at Madison Square Gardens. Mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nTrack 7. Is It Any Wonder?\n\nAt the core of Keane lies a precious creative affinity, a vocal gift which interprets emotional music with a stunning synchronicity. \u201cIt's very rare,\u201d notes Tom, \u201cthat both a singer and song-writer have that, together.\u201d Tom feels he can sing like this because he battles, as all proper singers do, \u201cinsecurity, vulnerability and fear of the world, coupled with the ability to stand in front of thousands of people and pour it all out: those two extremes are the beating heart of most singers\u201d. No wonder fellow artists love them: Paul McCartney, Pharrell Williams, Bono, Lily Allen, John Mayer, Nicole Scherzinger, Chris Martin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gwen Stefani, Zach Braff, novelist Brett Easton Ellis, Kanye West and Snoop Dogg.\n\nTrack 8. Nothing In My Way\n\nApril 2013, BBC Radio 2, London. \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019 is voted No.2 in the 100 Favourite Albums Of All Time by listeners of the UK's mighty Radio 2. Nothing stands in their way (apart from Coldplay at No.1), beating their all-time heroes: Simon & Garfunkel, Bruce Springsteen, The Beatles, REM, U2, Abba...\n\n\u201cTen years down the line and our vulnerability has been our saving grace,\u201d decides Tom. \u201cIt's something that can't be affected by changing fashions. Because that's a human truth.\u201d\n\nTrack 9. Hamburg Song\n\n2008, Germany. Keane love Germany, especially Berlin. \u201cA city which has picked itself up time and time again is so inspirational,\u201d says Tim. \u201cIts history, its creativity, its innovation, its spirit of reconciliation, is also the spirit of the band.\u201d They recorded third album \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 at Teldex Studios in Berlin.\n\nTrack 10. Crystal Ball\n\n2006 onwards, everywhere. As well as old-school universal songwriters, Keane are new-school pioneers: one of the first bands ever to release a single on a USB stick (\u2018Nothing In My Way\u2019, 2006): an acoustic gig on the Great Wall of China (in conjunction with the innovative Burberry, 2011): the first band to stream a 3D live show. \u201cNot bad,\u201d notes Rich, \u201cfor a band who started out playing The Crypt in Hastings.\u201d\n\nTrack 11. A Bad Dream\n\n2005, Helioscentric Studios, Rye, Sussex. Keane record second album \u2018Under The Iron Sea\u2019, lyrically much of which is political and social comment on the modern world, songs such as \u2018A Bad Dream\u2019 and \u2018Is It Any Wonder?\u2019 question the heroics of war. These themes are also present on some of the following album \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 in songs \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 and \u2018Better Than This\u2019 for example. In 2007 the band become War Child ambassadors and curate a night at Brixton Academy in aid of the charity, featuring Pet Shop Boys, Lily Allen and Guillemots amongst others.\n\nTrack 12. Try Again\n\n2012, Japan. Tom knows more than most what it's like to try again. \u201cThe good old days didn't really work for me, \u201cI didn't really appreciate how brilliant everything was, in the beginning,\u201d muses the ever-philosophical Tom. \u201cI don't think I was grown up enough, then.\u201d he laughs, over breakfast in Japan. \u201cBut now I feel the happiest I've ever felt. In my whole life.\u201d\n\nTrack 13. Spiralling\n\nFrom the very beginning. Of a decade's extraordinary moments, Tim cherishes the ones with his band mates most. \u201cI've a photo on my sitting room wall where we're in Brazil just completely pissing ourselves, basically,\u201d he smiles. \u201cThat for me is the ultimate. Such a simple thing. Being with my friends, laughing, a lot.\u201d\n\nTrack 14. Perfect Symmetry\n\nArt, always. Keane know how to collaborate, choosing dazzling minds to enhance their singular vision: novelist/force of nature Irvine Welsh (director of the foreboding Atlantic video, 2006), graphic designer Sanna Annukka (the dynamic swirls of the Under The Iron Sea art-work), artist Osang Gwon (the life-size, photo-montage sculptures for the Perfect Symmetry art-work). They've met a myriad heroes on what Tom calls \u201cThe Celebrity Thrill Ride at Disneyland\u201d. In 2011, a \u201cbabbling\u201d Tim met all-time hero Paul Simon two nights in a row, \u201cand his security guard clearly had me earmarked as a potentially dangerous nutter\u201d. In 2011 in Glasgow, they had a backstage photo-op with Paul McCartney, Tim\u2019s greatest hero other than Paul Simon. \u201cWe were stood in line and I thought, I'll let Tim stand next to him,\u201d remembers Jesse Quin, Keane's live bass player turned full-time member in 2011. \u201cAnd Paul McCartney shoved him out the way, pulled me next to him and said (comedy Liverpudlian) \u201cus bass players have gorra stick together, man!\u201d. \u201cTim won't let me forget it.\u201d In 2010, Tom sang with Queen at the Albert Hall, introduced by Brian May with the words: \u201cNo-one's sung this song since Freddie sang it, because they haven't been able to.\u201d\n\nTrack 15. My Shadow\n\n2004. Novelist William Boyd (currently penning the new James Bond novel) has enjoyed, in Keane, a curiously symbiotic connection: in their early years Keane wrote the song \u2018Any Human Heart\u2019, inspired by Boyd's novel of the same name. Never released, word filtered back to the writer anyway who was newly besotted with \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019, beguiled by Tom's \u201cethereal, plangent voice\u201d and Tim's \u201cmelodic generosity that was astounding in contemporary British rock\u201d. William and Tim became friends, by 2012 both individually plundering East Sussex/West Kent for creative inspiration, for the \u2018Strangeland\u2019 album and the \u2018Waiting For Sunrise\u2019 novel. A short story ensued, named after the \u2018Strangeland\u2019 single \u2018Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\u2019 (published on the deluxe CD sleeve-notes). \u201cKeane,\u201d wrote Boyd in a celebratory appraisal in the Guardian in 2012, \u201care a great British band.\u201d\n\nTrack 16. Silenced By The Night\n\n2006/7, Under The Iron Sea Tour, everywhere. Rich sits behind his drum-kit, transfixed, as Tom sings \u2018Try Again\u2019, the staggeringly plaintive piano dreamscape which doesn't require much drumming. \u201cAnd every night I would almost forget to come back in because I was lost, listening,\u201d he remembers. \u201cTom just does it night after night, absolutely beautifully. A remarkable singer.\u201d\n\nTrack 17. Disconnected\n\n\u201cIt sounds pretentious but the whole culture of Keane, to a lot of people, is a vitally positive thing,\u201d decides Tim. \u201cIt's definitely something real. We're brave and honest in our songs and people respond to that. Whether it's teenagers grappling with adulthood, people getting divorced, people stuck in war zones, they find, somehow, inspiration and comfort in our music.\u201d\n\nTrack 18. Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\n\n1980s. As kids in the 80s, the boys who would be Keane drank fizzy drinks in the Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9, Bexhill-on-Sea. As men in 2008, they drank fizzier drinks in Schwarzes Caf\u00e9, Berlin, the 24-hour bar where Keane relaxed most nights, sometimes 'til 6am. For the first time in his life, Tim felt he was truly \u201cliving the dream\u201d.\n\nTrack 19. Higher Than The Sun\n\nNovember 2013, everywhere. Keane's first-ever \u2018Best Of\u2019 is released this November, both a glorious celebration of one of Britain's best-loved bands and a soaring testament to the power of melodic rapture. The jury is in: from the magical, perennial alchemy of melancholy and beauty, this is undeniable evidence of Keane's considerable contribution to the sum of human happiness.\n\n\u201cIt's a classic thing in music, isn't it?\u201d decides Tim. \u201cAll the people I love, most of their songs have a melancholy tint, if not very dark. And yet their music makes you happy. People can get very serious about music. But at Keane gigs, everyone's smiling. Even if you're singing about heartbreak, confusion and desperation. Being able to connect with people, that's really all we care about.\u201d\n\nTrack 20. Won't Be Broken\n\nThe Future. As Keane's five No.1 albums attest, they've never faltered. Tim Rice-Oxley remains ambitious, focused, hungry.\n\n\u201cI think there is an undeniable quality to what we've achieved so far,\u201d he decides. \u201cBut it's in my nature to also feel that there's more we could do. One of those great albums of all time which you don't appreciate until you're older, with the extra wisdom you don't have when you're young. I've had my own ups and downs and feel like I'm just approaching the point where I could write an album like that. The richness is beginning to come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all just want to feel connected, don't we?\u201d concludes Tom, of the power of Keane's singularly emotive music. \u201cTo the world. To each other. I hope if we've done anything we've given people a sense that the world is not such a huge scary place as it can sometimes seem. That we are all in it together. To the end. So you might as well try and understand what it is to be a human being, while we're all here.\u201d", "otherInfo": "There is a delivery delay until 2/24/20."}, {"Address": "500 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "M.O.M.", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.437364, 37.774222], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Madrone Art Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"M.O.M.

With her thoughtful narrative voice, Palehound singer/songwriter Ellen Kempner imbues each song on the album with a radical sensitivity, an unchecked depth of feeling that ultimately sparks a greater open-heartedness within the listener.\n\nCo-produced by Kempner and Gabe Wax (Beirut, Soccer Mommy), Black Friday follows 2017\u2019s A Place I\u2019ll Always Go\u2014a widely acclaimed release that landed on many year-end best-of lists. In creating the album, Kempner and her bandmates Jesse Weiss (drums) and Larz Brogan (bass) recorded at Panoramic House in Stinson Beach, California, tracking most of the songs live and breathing a new vitality into Palehound\u2019s elegantly detailed sound.\n\nUnrestrained in emotion but subtle in sonic flourish, Black Friday opens with the stripped-back intensity of \u201cCompany,\u201d the first of many songs conveying a profound longing for a lost friend. From there, Palehound shift into the joyful wonder of \u201cAaron,\u201d a song Kempner wrote for her partner in the midst of his transitioning process. \u201cIt\u2019s about the past year of him coming out and me helping him through that, and just watching him grow so much,\u201d she says. With her hushed yet urgent vocals, Kempner reveals her ability to draw so much power from a single word, turning \u201cAaron\u201d into an indelibly tender expression of devotion and love.\n\nPalehound examine the intricacies of friendship and partnership all throughout Black Friday, handling the subject with a level of attention rarely found in pop songs. On the quietly hypnotic title track, Kempner captures the specific ache of uneven emotional investment between friends, framing her plaintive acceptance in particularly barbed lyrics (\u201cYou\u2019re Black Friday and I\u2019m going to the mall\u201d). And on \u201cWorthy,\u201d Palehound speak to the challenge of navigating self-confidence issues in relationships, and delicately showcase Kempner\u2019s lyrical finesse (\u201cAnd I\u2019ve won over your mother, darling/And I\u2019ve won over your sister too/And I won over your father, darling/And I still don\u2019t feel worthy of you\u201d).\n\nWhile much of Black Friday unfolds with palpable compassion, \u201cKiller\u201d takes on a vengeful mood as Kempner recounts a fantasy of doing away with a friend\u2019s abuser. \u201cIt came from being so fed up with people who feel like they can take advantage of others sexually or physically or emotionally to get ahead or get what they want, and just wanting to destroy that culture in general,\u201d she says. On the following track, Palehound continue their contemplation of abuse with \u201cWhere We Live\u201d\u2014a striking piece of spoken word from New York City-based poet Melissa Lozada- Oliva; its gritty yet dreamlike storytelling set against Kempner\u2019s sprawling guitar work.\n\nIn bringing Black Friday to life, Kempner spent much of her time holed up in the practice space she shares with a wrestling troupe, pursuing a songwriting process that\u2019s often emotionally fraught. \u201cFor me songs usually start with some really strong anxiety or other bad emotion,\u201d says Kempner. \u201cI generally don\u2019t pick up a guitar when I\u2019m feeling super-happy.\u201d Originally from Connecticut, she first started writing songs at age 10, several years after taking up guitar. \u201cMy dad wrote songs and played guitar and we\u2019re really close, so I always felt inspired to make music too,\u201d she notes. After playing in a punk band in high school, Kempner began putting out songs under the name Palehound at age 18, then released the project\u2019s debut EP Bent Nail in 2013 and full-length debut Dry Food in 2015. Arriving in June 2017, A Place I\u2019ll Always Go earned praise from outlets like Pitchfork (who hailed Kempner\u2019s voice as \u201cspecific and visceral\u201d) and NPR (who stated that Palehound\u2019s \u201cunflinching songs are also a celebration of life and embrace of love, and an empathetic reflection on how endings usually lead to beginnings\u201d).\n\nWith Black Friday building off the emotional complexity of its predecessor, Palehound hope that the album might help others to work through their own troubles in life and love of all kinds. \u201cMaking music\u2019s always been a therapeutic thing for me\u2014that\u2019s such a big part of the reason why I do it in the first place,\u201d says Kempner. \u201cWhat I always want to do with my songs is to help people heal in some way, or come to some new understanding about whatever it is that they\u2019re going through. Even if it\u2019s just hearing a song and feeling less alone than they were before, that would mean so much to me.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3158 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Los Train Wreck", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419467, 37.746817], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "El Rio", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "All-Star Jam with Los Train Wreck at El Rio: With moderately priced (and heavily poured) drinks, a sprawling patio, and an intimate stage in a side room, this Mission District destination is a keystone of indie-hipster nightlife.

That's the story of Ricky Skaggs. By age twenty-one, he was already considered a \"recognized master\" of one of America's most demanding art forms, but his career took him in other directions, catapulting him to popularity and success in the mainstream of country music. His life's path has taken him to various musical genres, from where it all began in bluegrass music, to striking out on new musical journeys, while still leaving his musical roots intact.\n\nRicky struck his first chords on a mandolin over 50 years ago, and this 15-time Grammy Award winner continues to do his part to lead the recent roots revival in music. With 12 consecutive Grammy-nominated classics behind him, all from his own Skaggs Family Records label (Bluegrass Rules! in 1998, Ancient Tones in 1999, History of the Future in 2001, Soldier of the Cross, Live at the Charleston Music Hall, and Big Mon: The Songs of Bill Monroe in 2003, Brand New Strings in 2005, Instrumentals in 2007, Salt of the Earth with The Whites in 2008, Honoring the Fathers of Bluegrass: Tribute to 1946 and 1947 in 2009 and Ricky Skaggs Solo: Songs My Dad Loved along with Mosaic in 2010), the diverse and masterful tones made by the gifted Skaggs come from a life dedicated to playing music that is both fed by the soul and felt by the heart.\n\n2018 was a stellar year for Skaggs, with the addition of three more Hall of Fame inductions: the National Fiddler Hall of Fame, IBMA\u2019s Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and country music\u2019s greatest honor, the Country Music Hall of Fame. Along with his three previous inductions into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Association\u2019s Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Musicians Hall of Fame, all six awards display his ability to masterfully cross genres with versatility in styles and instruments.\n\nRicky Skaggs has often said that he is \"just trying to make a living\" playing the music he loves. But it's clear that his passion for bluegrass puts him in the position to bring this lively, distinctively American form of music out of isolation and into the ears and hearts of audiences across the country and around the world.

This is the path that lead songwriter and multi-instrumentalist-turned-producer, Andrew Vait, to Little Wins. His Seattle powerhouse duo, SISTERS, was formed in 2014 and has enjoyed a four-year run of small victories; opening for Allen Stone at Chateau Ste Michelle within their first four live shows; appearing on the main stages of Sasquatch! Music Festival, Capitol Hill Block Party and NYC Pride; their song, Buck, was placed in a national Toyota ad campaign; and they are now signed to Tender Loving Empire - a boutique record label in Portland, OR.\n\nAfter SISTERS\u2019 first tour of Europe concluded in late 2017, Vait discovered that a surplus of emotions from world-travel (and subsequently returning to the American hotbed of dispiriting political affairs) produced a proportionate surplus in creativity, and, being a student of social justice, Vait began writing songs with a new narrative. Where \u201cjoy as an act of revolutionary defiance in the face of oppression\u201d defines SISTERS, Vait is now carefully considering his complicity in systems of oppression as a white male in the music industry, and he is retracing his own family lines, which includes battles with clinical depression and addiction. Taking major influence from WOC artists; namely, Solange, SZA, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Vait seeks to honor and pay tribute to the black artists who have shaped modern music and culture. He stands tall among other white artists who have followed in similar footsteps - Francis and the Lights, Bon Iver, James Blake, Steve Winwood, Peter Gabriel, to name a few.\n\nAfter writing the bedrock of songs that would become the first Little Wins singles, Vait shared a handful of demos with his friend, Nate Mercereau, who produces and records with the likes of Jay-Z, Leon Bridges, and John Legend. Mercereau persuaded Vait to explore additional production elements and encouraged him to finish the recordings on his own. Armed with a MacBook Air, a MIDI controller, and a Shure SM7b, Vait, who plays guitar, piano, saxophone, flute, clarinet, and drums, and has extensive experience with analog synthesizers, turned Garageband (his DAW at the time) inside-out and produced his first two singles, almost exclusively utilizing Garageband instruments. He brought the tracks to Andy Park (engineer/producer for Pedro The Lion, Ciara, Noah Gundersen), and together, they finished the mixes.\n\nThe lead single, Let Me Into Your Heart, is about recognizing and facing fear; struggling to find a home and a voice while celebrating small victories, like the warmth of the sun and conquering despair.

After spinning at a number of clubs in Chicago\u2019s underground hip-hop scene before being able to legally drink, Toure relocated to Tallahassee, Florida to attend college. It was here in Florida where Toure displayed his taste making pedigree by breaking Rick Ross\u2019s introductory single \u201cHustlin\u201d on his Collateral Payment mixtape. Becoming one of the area\u2019s requested DJ\u2019s, Toure soon found himself spinning at clubs nearly every day of the week.

Developing a cult following, 100.7 FM \u201cThe Beat\u201d owned by media giant Clear Channel came calling. Once 100.7 went defunct, Toure moved on to Cumulus Media owned \u201cBlazin\u201d 102.3 FM where he worked until graduating from Florida A&M with honors.

After being blown away by his immaculate presentation and genre-bending mixing in person, Estelle signed Toure as her official tour DJ, further legitimizing his already elite reputation.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Unlovely, the third full length album from Calin \"Callie\" Peters (vocals, cello, bass), Martin Earley (vocals, guitar), and Devin Mauch (vocals, percussion), isn't about the complete absence of beauty. Instead, the eleven tracks on The Ballroom Thieves latest LP are a sonic encapsulation of emotional and political dissonance, the constant state of discomfort that's enveloped the world for the past few years.\n\n\"We write about the things that are important to us and right now, it's impossible to ignore the inadequate state of the world,\" says Earley. \"We just wrote the songs that came out of us and they happened to be largely political.\" He continues, \"In an ideal world, we would never write a political record-there'd be nothing extreme enough to warrant it.\"\n\nTackling subjects as weighty as greed, inequality, privilege, and narcissism, and as light as fulfillment and adoration, Unlovely offers a track for every occasion, whether you're furious, depressed, exhausted, or hopeful. Songs like \"Homme Run\" and the title track boil over with exasperation and disgust, rage and resentment running through every line in protest of today's global status quo. Others like \"Love is Easy\" and \"Tenebrist\" turn the focus inward onto doubts of purpose and identity.\n\nAs their first album entirely co-written by Peters and Earley, save for Peters' song \"Pendulum,\" Unlovely is a tangible reflection of their evolution from band members to life partners. \"Figuring out how to write as a writing team has been something of an adventure,\" says Earley. \"We used to create songs more separately but found that we complement each other well in almost every sense of the word, including songwriting. Most of the songs I brought to the table were inspired by our dreadful news cycle but tend to involve some sort of hopeful or romantic spin, whereas most of Callie's songs are about smashing the patriarchy and destroying evil forever.\"\n\nSongs like \"Begin Again\" and the Gilberto & Getz-influenced \"Don't Wanna Dance\" serve as a window into Peters' perspective, someone who is, as she says, \"smiling through\" regardless of how difficult and frustrating that facade is to maintain. \"I began writing a few years ago, and when I started, it felt like I opened up this whole verbal world in my head,\" says Peters. \"For a while, I thought that by writing all the time, I was perpetuating my pain, but over time, I've found a way to use words to help ease my mind.\"\n\n\"I wrote a lot of the lines while sitting in the van and having a difficult time as we drove past nondescript highways,\" she says, adding that while some of her notes were unintelligible, others were crafted with more poetic intentions. \"I hope that by getting some of my thoughts down, I could show someone lonely that there might be one other human in the world who feels like they do.\"\n\nIncorporating musical styles that range from Motown to classic rock and metal, Unlovely maintains the recognizable, nostalgia-tinged sound of The Ballroom Thieves' previous outputs while pushing a heightened brashness. Since the release of their first EP and debut full-length, A Wolf in the Doorway, The Ballroom Thieves have consistently and skillfully crossed genres, joining artists like Caamp, Langhorne Slim and Shakey Graves to bridge the gap between folk, rock and soul. With Unlovely, thanks in part to frequent collaborator Ariel Bernstein, the trio took it a step further and grew their instrumental arsenal, amplifying their signature energy and eccentricity. \"Ariel has been a great friend of ours for years now,\" says Earley. \"He's a talented musician, engineer, and unlicensed band therapist, so when we decided to expand our touring party, he was the unanimous first round draft pick.\"\n\nEngineered and produced by Jerry Streeter (Brandi Carlile, The Lumineers, Vance Joy), Unlovely was recorded in and around the northeast, predominantly at HearStudios in Camden, Maine.\n\nIt's their unique brand of powerful and harmonious music, while never shying away from topics and ideas they are passionate about that has charmed fans around the country. Their catalogue has amassed over 85 million streams and they've gained a loyal live following, selling out shows and earning festival spots at Boston Calling, Newport Folk, Moon River, Mountain Jam, and Calgary Folk. Ultimately, Unlovely sets the stage for The Thieves to continue to impact listeners everywhere.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Panic is Perfect", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7206228.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: u tell us", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "PANIC IS PERFECT\n\nSan Francisco based band, Panic Is Perfect, came to be in a very roundabout way. Founders Jeremy Belzer and Mike Hoffman actually formed the project in Southern India by way of travel throughout their relative lives from Kansas City, Portland, Los Angeles, Ghana, Thailand, Korea, China, India eventually settling in the Bay Area and completing the 5-piece live band with the addition of Ty Parker on drums, Joey Hassid on synths and David Monzon on guitar.\n\nJeremy chased the arts and was awarded a scholarship to CalArts taking 1st place in a nationwide painting competition. He spent nights listening to records in the library and wound up majoring in Music Composition. After college, he decided to take to the world with his laptop, guitar and microphone and wrote and recorded hundreds of songs while living in the jungles of Thailand, seeking higher consciousness in India, and sweating in tiny apartments in Korea and China.\n\nMike, a drummer since the age of 10, dropped out after his first year of music school to travel to West Africa and study with a Master tribal drummer in rural Ghana. Mike played heavily in the local African and Afro-pop scene upon returning home, later moving to LA to finish his education at CalArts. It was there that he was turned on to writing and producing music, making his first solo album on an 8-track tape recorder.\n\nMusic became the driver and underneath their syncopated, multi-layered rhythmic arrangements, Panic Is Perfect writes simple indie pop songs with meaningful lyrics and melodies that stay with you long after the songs end. Sharing vocals, Mike and Jeremy sway the listener in and out of catchy vocal and melodic hooks, danceable beats and textures that reflect their well-travelled global tastes and influences. As multi-instrumentalists, they both play most of the instruments on their recordings. They each sing lead vocals on the songs that they contribute as writers, adding more diversity to the overall sound. Ultimately Panic is Perfect writes songs that, when stripped of all their elaborate production, are meaningful, memorable and undeniably unique and infectious.", "otherInfo": "Performing Live: NEON DREAMS \u25cf THIS MODERN \u25cf PANIC IS PERFECT \u25cf GREAT HIGHWAY \u25cf rock. \u25cf doors @ 7pm; show @ 8pm. \u25cf all ages. \u25cf $10 advance; $12 day of show. \u25cf RSVP: https://www.facebook.com/events/1503064916518946 \u25cf Buy tickets: https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2020/03-12d.html \u25cf Watch and listen: Neon Dreams: Marching Bands: http://youtu.be/jPnMSzEOBaQ \u25cf This Modern: Runaway: http://youtu.be/dCRz3OoMXOY \u25cf Panic Is Perfect: Go Go Go: http://youtu.be/q5yzNaeByLU \u25cf Great Highway: The Chase: http://youtu.be/i9TG27xRVrA"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Junior Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Ferreira", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club Crystal Cavern", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Elizabeth Lubin is headlining the Crystal Cavern with some friends!"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Great Highway", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8842733.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Ambitious synth pop live violin", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Ambitious synth pop + live violin and sax.\n\nConnect at: www.takegreathighway.com", "otherInfo": "Performing Live: NEON DREAMS \u25cf THIS MODERN \u25cf PANIC IS PERFECT \u25cf GREAT HIGHWAY \u25cf rock. \u25cf doors @ 7pm; show @ 8pm. \u25cf all ages. \u25cf $10 advance; $12 day of show. \u25cf RSVP: https://www.facebook.com/events/1503064916518946 \u25cf Buy tickets: https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2020/03-12d.html \u25cf Watch and listen: Neon Dreams: Marching Bands: http://youtu.be/jPnMSzEOBaQ \u25cf This Modern: Runaway: http://youtu.be/dCRz3OoMXOY \u25cf Panic Is Perfect: Go Go Go: http://youtu.be/q5yzNaeByLU \u25cf Great Highway: The Chase: http://youtu.be/i9TG27xRVrA"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Pllush", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8631227.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": ":~)", "otherInfo": "GREAT GRANDPA\nAlien Boy\nPllush\n7 pm\n$13 adv / $15 doors\nAll Ages"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Marc Ford", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9478365.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Rockn Roll, Blues, Blues-Rock, Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "Note for note, Marc Ford ranks as one of the world\u2019s preeminent guitarists.

He has the best guitar sound I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s career began in Los Angeles during the 1980s. His group, Burning Tree, captured the essence of his guitar virtuosity and songwriting.\n\nHe joined the Black Crowes in late 1991. Ford toured and recorded on three of the Crowes\u2019 finest albums--The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, Amorica, and Three Snakes and One Charm. Ford\u2019s tenure in the Crowes found the group operating at a zenith. He rejoined the Crowes in 2005-2006 when they toured and released The Lost Crowes--two albums the band never released when he was a member.\n\nIn 2002, Ford released his first solo album, It\u2019s About Time. During this era, Ford experienced the highs and lows of surviving in a cutthroat music business through the years as well as being a dedicated family man. Ford\u2019s following solo albums included Weary And Wired (2007), The Fuzz Machine (2010) and Holy Ghost (2014).\n\nFord won a NAACP award (John F. Kennedy counts as one of the few other Caucasians bestowed the honor) for his work on the Ben Harper and Blind Boys of Alabama album There Will Be A Light.\n\nAlso, Ford\u2019s role as a record producer allowed him to use his gift of tone and a powerful ability to listen. Artists he produced include Ryan Bingham, Pawnshop Kings, Steepwater Band, Chris Lizotte, Phantom Limb and Republique du Salem. Marc Ford exists as a musical architect of the highest order.\n\nThrough his career Marc Ford has performed and recorded with Izzy Stradlin, Gov\u2019t Mule, The Jayhawks, The Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers, Federale, Widespread Panic, Blue Floyd, Booker T. Jones, Ivan Neville and Heartbreaker Mike Campbell.\n\nThe group on The Vulture, The Neptune Blues Club, recorded their debut album in 2009, which charted at #15 for two weeks on the blues charts. This versatile ensemble includes Mike Malone (vocals, harp, keys), John Bazz (bass), Anthony Arvizu (drums) and Ford. Mr. Ford unleashes his hypnotic guitar skills on these soulful tunes.\n\nThe Vulture was recorded on analog tape at mastermind John Vanderslide\u2019s Tiny Telephone Studios located in the mission district of San Francisco. The Vulture emits Ford\u2019s greatest strengths: soulful musicianship, memorable songs and an emotive groove.\n\nFord explained the ethos of these new compositions: \u201cIf Holy Ghost was Sunday morning, then The Vulture is Saturday night\u2026\u201d\n\nThe opening track--\u201dDevil\u2019s In the Details\u201d--emerges as one of Ford\u2019s finest. The tune operates in his electric wheelhouse. He\u2019s like Clint Eastwood with a guitar. The well-crafted \u201cThe Same Coming Up\u201d clocks in at one minute and fifty seconds emitting joyous rock n roll. \u201cAll We Need To Do Is Love\u201d eases the listener into pastoral reflection. \u201cThis Ride\u201d inspires reckless abandon. The title track contains Ford\u2019s signature snakebite guitar work as he delivers a savage truth in the lyrics: \u201cGot a head full of diamonds/And a nose full of snow/You leave a trail of destruction/Everywhere that you go/Got a shrug of the shoulder/For all that you stole.\u201d\n\n\u201cArkansas Gas Card\u201d stands as one of the group\u2019s stellar numbers that transfers with brilliance to a live audience. \u201cOld Lady Sunrise\u201d travels into sonic backwaters of a low-country swamp like some vintage STAX Records jewel. The gospel-laced \u201cDeep Water\u201d explores redemptive sanctuaries where matters of the soul are at stake.\n\n\u201cShalimar Dreams\u201d augments a gritty R&B, rock-n-roll magic in a mesmerizing sound that surrounds the listener. The last cut, \u201cGirl of Mine\u201d, is a love song Ford sings and provides steel on as the group provides a sparse, yet concise musical backdrop.\n\nIt\u2019s harvest time for Marc Ford. Over the years he\u2019s created his own stellar sound that meets all the rigid standards of excellence. The Vulture represents another timeless volume in Marc Ford\u2019s inimitable musical journey...\n\n2017 saw the birth of Marc's new focus, a project called The Magpie Salute, which also features former Black Crowes Rich Robinson and Sven Pipien. The band is in the studio currently, recording a new album for a summer release and subsequent world tour.\n\nJames Calemine", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "400 Eddy St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Keyon Harrold", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.414392, 37.78382], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Black Cat", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "3x Grammy Winner KEYON HARROLD!"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Johnny Stachela", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8588258.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Rock, Jam Bands", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "Guitarist Johnny Stachela is currently on a world wide tour and garnering much attention with the newly formed Allman Betts Band.

Neon Dreams needed to make a change, so Kadillac headed to a healing retreat in Sedona, Arizona, where he was encouraged to open up about his troubled childhood. \u201cIt was the most painful thing ever.\u201d But the experience made Kadillac realize the power he holds as a songwriter, one who has reached millions of listeners. \u201cI always think, \u2018What does the world need?

In 2017, High Pulp emerged from a weekly \u201cFunk Church\u201d residency at Seattle\u2019s historic jazz club The Royal Room. It was here that the collective took shape, grew together, and set about creating their unique style of instrumental music.\n\nSoon thereafter, High Pulp entered the studio to record their debut album Bad Juice, released in June 2018. Featuring 8 tracks, this album whisks the listener on a Bad-Juice-induced stupor of euphoria and narcosis, all the while inducing subconscious head-bobbing.\n\nNow, High Pulp is feverishly producing their next wave of releases. Their Light Fix EP (November 2019) brought vocalists into High Pulp\u2019s extended musical family for the first time, featuring guest appearances by three R&B/soul singers and KEXP favorites: JusMoni, Falon Sierra and Shaina Shepherd (BEARAXE).\n\n\u201cHigh Pulp\u2019s infusion of soul-based hiphop, R&B, and funk cannot be missed\u201d - The Stranger\n\n\"Seattle\u2019s fusion big band High Pulp\u2019s debut... answers the new millennium\u2019s post-trip-hop, -indie, -ambient, -drum & bass, etc. contemporary with vinyl sharp grooves, macram\u00e9 arrangements, and session-level instrumentation\" - Earshot Jazz\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t many bands making music like this right now\u201d - What\u2019s Up!

Each of these artists joined in writing and recording a track with High Pulp, and together the three tracks formulate the Light Fix EP (released Fall 2019).\n\nIn 2020, the story of MUTUAL ATTRACTION continues, with a series of releases in partnership with Portland-based Dutch Records. In the way that music is a grand tapestry of past, present, and future threads woven together, the MUTUAL ATTRACTION series explores what happens when an artist meditates deeply on the influential threads of their musical past and reweaves them into the musical present, repeatedly asking the question: \u201cWhat if?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine throwing on this LP and feeling anything less than joy.

One of the first bands in the cross over thrash metal genre, They released their debut album Fools Game back in 1989. Fool's Game gave birth to the hit single Everyday\u2019s A Holiday, a huge crowd pleaser at the live shows; it also yielded a video which played in heavy rotation on MTV & other music stations internationally in addition to helping secure a successful American/European tour supporting the likes of Sacred Reich, Overkill, Nuclear Assault and Celtic Frost. In 1991 came their second album, In This Life, which garnered 5 star reviews like Kerrang magazine's https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1389669184606211.1073741830.1377819649124498&type=3 This album spawned 2 hit singles, Falling Away & Esse Quam Videri. Both videos for the singles enjoyed heavy rotation on MTV and worldwide. Touring for support of In This Life produced a live home video, In This LIVE, from one of their amazing headlining shows at the Marquee club in London which sold out both nights. 1992 arrived & Mordred release the 6 track EP that was Vision. The EP included a wide variety of the crossover thrash sound & again enjoyed lots of radio exposure.

James quit school in grade 10 and moved to Vancouver in 1980. While trying to hook up with musicians there, he managed to open for Stevie Ray Vaughan for a show back in Regina. Vaughan was quite impressed with Colin's performance and subsequently took James on the road for several tour dates in the USA.\n\nIt was Stevie Ray Vaughan who gave Colin James his stage name.

It is a dark, pressing and lively album that reflects on a sense of loss, of time slipping away through your fingers. MTT mixes up influences from Kate Bush, Michael Jackson, The Knife and Portishead and draws inspiration from horror movies, ghost stories blending the otherworldly with universal feelings of anxiety, melancholy and hope. [DUTCH] Na een veelgeprezen debuut komt MTT (voorheen Minus The Tiger) in het voorjaar van 2014 met de opvolger, Years From Now. Het sfeervolle, persoonlijke album is zowel muzikaal als inhoudelijk een spannende stap vooruit. Een intensieve periode waarin onder meer de geboorte van een dochter voor een nieuw perspectief zorgde, krijgt een introspectieve, bij vlagen melancholische invulling. Vrees niet, het album blijft ver uit de buurt van een muzikale versie van het wanhopigere segment van de ingezonden brievenrubriek van de Ouders van Nu. Sterker, MTT heeft een knap, doorleefd en urgent album gemaakt, speciaal voor iedereen die weet hoe het voelt als de tijd je door de vingers glipt. De gloedvolle en wonderlijk geslaagde poging de jaren tachtig te mixen met een actuele sound, zijn een voorlopige kroon op de samenwerking tussen zangeres Anne Broekman, producer Maarten Besseling en drummer Jos Terlingen. Het resultaat sluit nog nadrukkelijker aan bij de internationale ambities die de band met het debuut over de grenzen al op de kaart zette.

Since then, the band has circled the country another couple of times, toured the South in the spring of 2012 and has toured Alaska once or twice a year for several years now. The duo hunkered down in northern Arizona for a spell where the lawlessness and the cheap booze were fine fodder for a second album.

With this idea of music traveling and music as creative resistance, LoCura takes the trip back again mixing it up with their own Califas Flamenkito, Reggae, and Cuban Son styles.

It\u2019s a friendship and partnership that\u2019s proved pivotal to both of them both personally and professionally. As a duo, their respective skill sets were perfectly matched: Simon was the one with the more traditional musical background while Ben had a penchant for sound engineering. Both loved DJ culture though and both spun. United by a love of underground club nights like Stealth and Detonate in Nottingham, their passion for music from drum \u2018n\u2019 bass to house was honed after many a night and early morning dancing \u2018til dawn. Needless to say, after they graduated, Messrs James and Hall made their way to London. Wasting no time with their electronic ambitions, both acquired computer software. Says Si over coffee in Kings Cross: \u201cBecause we both had the same interests in music, we thought we\u2019d align our knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe dance-floor-fuelled d \u2018n\u2019 b tear-up \u2018Abort\u2019 was their debut release on Viper, which made so much noise that the duo duly signed to Andy C\u2019s Ram Recordings. Quickly establishing themselves as a force to be reckoned with, \u2018Space Time\u2019/Take The Stairs\u2019 solidified their place as low-end bass innovators. But as you\u2019ll soon hear, this is one duo who don\u2019t ever want to be put in a box. Or stand still for too long either. This isn\u2019t an act dwelling on the past, which is why we\u2019re now going to fast-forward to the present day. With a super-successful debut album for Ram Records/BMG (the chart-chomping \u2018Paradise Lost\u2019) [Debuting in both the US and UK iTunes Electronic charts in the top #10 and shifting over 250k+ copies worldwide across streaming and physical product] and Winners of Best Producers as the 2016 DNB Awards, the Delta future is all about music and touring. But beyond \u2013 and also before - that, what they\u2019re really looking for is their own lane.\n\n\u201cWhen we started coming through via Ram, the genre barriers had dropped around bass music a lot and we were keen to bridge those gaps and work across different genres: we said to Ram at the very beginning that we didn\u2019t want to just make pure drum \u2018n\u2019 bass music, we wanted to do something different. Some people aren\u2019t happy when you do a lot of different stuff so finding a way that incorporates different genres that feels like us took some time. When we made our album, we found that comfortable space.\u201d says Simon.\n\nThe American-sounding stuff that we do bridges that Transatlantic divide.\u201d In the end, it\u2019s about balance. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d nods Ben. \u201cWe grew up going to dirty little raves! Because we play so many territories, in some places they like it more underground and others more mainstream. Varying what you play to suit your audience is important. A short high-powered festival set can be great but we also love Fabric. I live in the US now and we have been doing some big shows in America and Australia, but this Friday I headline Fabric \u2013 so I will get to play some old classics that wouldn\u2019t necessarily fit in at a US festival.\u201d So Fabric still means a lot? \u201cI have been going since I was 16! So yes, it\u2019s still a huge deal for us. It also inspires us to go away and write more music, whether that\u2019s a club banger or a track with real depth.\u201d Both Simon and Ben are wary of DJs who \u201cplay the same set for 18 months. The idea of that numbs my mind! I will spend half of Friday preparing songs for Fabric\u2026 it\u2019s not a chore.\u201d\n\nThat same dedication goes into their new radio show, which airs Friday nights on Evolution/iHeartRadio. \u201cAgain, we just wanted to be in our own lane,\u201d says Ben, \u201cand to enhance that was all about playing music we\u2019re into in an outlet or space where we can play whatever we want to play. I wanted to showcase some UK d \u2018n\u2019 b which they might not be hearing elsewhere. We are trying to show everyone tuning in who\u2019ve heard of us, all the different aspects of what we\u2019re into at the moment. DNB from the UK; dubstep from America, trap stuff from Australia and also some bassier, noisier sounds of course! Hopefully what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t replicated by another show. There\u2019s so much good music being made by so many talented people around the planet, and if we can hear a sonic footprint whatever BPM it\u2019s at, our aim is to tie it all together for a cohesive hour.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Delta Heavy have several key releases in the bag, including a collaboration with Dirty Audio which is being released on both Ram and Monstercat from North America.\n\nAre there grand plans? We\u2019ll let Ben have the final word. \u201cWhen we write these tunes, you never know when things are going to pop up! Are there grand plans? Just to keep writing music! So for now, \u2026 the live show, that's the main focus,\u201d smiles Ben.", "otherInfo": "Vital Events & Olympus Events Present\nSequence 03.19 ft.

The result is music that is both familiar and fresh to the listener, offering an unassuming yet explorative convergence of genres and influences spanning American Folk, Soul, Reggae, Rock and Brazilian rhythms. A consummate and electrifying performer, Quetzal exudes a brilliance that is rare in contemporary music. His sound is inspired by the likes of Sting, Jimi Hendrix, and Santana.

D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

While attending college, Tim began to experiment with guitar. He became especially fascinated with song-writing and recording. He began co-writing and recording and producing with the New Jersey based band Dog Show Blues. During this time he also worked on what would later become his debut album. Attributing much of his inspiration to his three older brothers, he named the solo project The Fourth Son. His debut album The Fourth Son EP was released in 2014. In the winter of 2015, The Fourth Son relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, and began developing a live presence. He played at open-mic nights throughout the Bay Area, while teaching elementary physical education by day. He released his second album titled Lavenia in 2016. With an increasing number of tour dates the project has developed a unique and powerful live sound.

After their formation in 1979 and release of the \"I Hate Tourists\" Ep in 1980 they recorded the famous song \"This Is Boston, Not LA\" which became the title of the now infamous comp Lp. Although thought of as a Boston band they were actually from the Cape Cod area orignally. After forming while still in high school, the band went thru many shifting line-ups all revolving around singer/lyricist Clif Hanger and for most of the bands existence, guitarist and co-writer Bill Close. In 1983 they released the classic hardcore Lp \"Land Of The Lost\" and then were more or less successful at producing a new Lp every couple years or so up thru the \"personal troubles\" period of the \"Misery Loves Company\" record and ending with their last full-length in 1999, \"One False Move\" on Dr.Strange records. The Freeze music is driving hardcore at it's roots but always has a solid melodic ring thanks to the more-than-competent musical ability of guitarist Bill Close. Clif's lyrics are dark, twisted, unstable, paranoid and at their best are fantasy stories from the scary corners of his mind.\n\n2) The Freeze is also a punk band formed in 1976. The Freeze formed in 1976 and initially consisted of Gordon Sharp (vocals), David Clancy (guitar), Keith Grant (bass), and Graeme Radin (drums). (Later line-ups would see the addition of a guitarist/saxophonist/clarinetist Tony Wallis, alternate drummer/keyboardist Neil Braidwood and alternate bassist Mike Moran.) The band was active from 1976 to 1982, gigging continuously throughout their homeland of Scotland, and supporting a wide range of acts, from the likes of Sham 69 to Echo & The Bunnymen. On stage they were quite the lively bunch - with an unusually diverse spectrum of sound, glam-punk gender-bending theatrics, and a knack for random song improvisation - it was a package that often left onlookers enthusiastically scratching their heads in astonishment.\n\nThe group had two official releases \u2013 1979\u2019s debut 7-inch EP In Colour, and 1980\u2019s 7-inch single Celebration, both of which were self-financed on their own A1 label. And although The Freeze would prove that they undoubtedly had both the musical talent and vision needed to propel their name into the greater new wave market, it was their eclectic and unpredictable nature that ultimately barred them from capturing proper label interest. Not to say their wasn't any interested\u2026 John Peel noticed the band and in late 1980 invited them to do their first BBC radio session, followed by another session in 1981, both of which have yet to see any official release. By 1982 Gordon had become increasingly dissatisfied with the confines of the band\u2019s musical format, wishing to instead give focus to more experimental song structures, a desire which eventually lead him to forge a new union with fellow core-member David Clancy, move to London and change the band\u2019s name to Cindytalk.\n\n(text taken from http://lifeonthedot.blogspot.com/2007/08/freeze-in-colour-ep-1979.html)", "otherInfo": "MORTIFIED \u25cf Mortified is a comic excavation of adolescent writing, art & media.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "420 1st St, Santa Rosa, CA 95401", "Artist": "The Freak Accident", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9973434.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.715159, 38.437583], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Shady Oak Barrel House", "moreBioInfo": "The Freak Accident is a Punk/Math/Garage/Pop/Surf/Rock collision led by Victims Family/Jello Biafra and GSM guitarist-vocalist Ralph Spight.

After\nthe Gay Gay\u2019s went on hiatus, Freeman moved forward with forming a band that could be as\ngood as AC/DC.\n\nFreeman began by recruiting lightning-speed guitarist, Steve McKnight after meeting him online\nand sharing similar musical tastes. McKnight has been a part of the LA music scene since the\nlate \u201880s in Cry Wolf, a melodic hard rock band that made their mark on the Sunset Strip and\nbeyond with several major albums under their belt.\n\nAlso recruited was Karl Rumpf on rhythm guitar, who Freeman had met while on tour with\nPansy Division and later worked with in a band/project called Dart. Rumpf was also in the last\nincarnation of the Gay Gay\u2019s, along with drummer Brian Welch who Freeman had also met\nwhile on tour. Welch had spent years touring with Extreme as their drum tech, so he was a\nnatural fit.\n\nThis four-piece spent months looking for a gay vocalist to no avail. Finally, Freeman asked the\nothers if HE could audition. Nervously, he did, the band agreed, and they were off\u2014but now\nthey needed a bassist, so Freeman recruited bass player extraordinaire, Glen Pavan, once again\nsomeone Freeman had met while on tour. Pavan had previously been keeping the low end down\nfor LA queer punk rockers Best Revenge (who got their name from a Pansy Division song).\n\nNow in their second year as a band, the word of mouth has been intense, even scoring a \u201cpick of\nthe week\u201d in LA Weekly for a recent LA gig.\n\nThe band remains true to the music (working diligently to replicate the actual sound of AC/DC),\nwhile playing around with the lyrics and changing pronouns to suit the gay angle. Hence, TNT\nbecomes PNP (a song about the \u201cparty-n-play\u201d status some gay men post in their online sex ads),\nBad Boy Boogie becomes Gay Boy Boogie (do you really need to ask?), and Big Balls needed\n\u2026 no changing at all!\n\nTo say the band is off-the-hook live is an understatement. There is never a dull moment with all\nthe costume changes and props being trotted out, all in the name of outrageous entertainment.\nEven those who say they don\u2019t like AC/DC end up being fans.\n\nWho can blame them?

Since then she has released six albums, winning multiple awards for her songwriting. \u201cHurricane\u201d won Best Song in the American Songwriting Awards, and \u201cBeautiful\u201d was a winner with International Unsigned Only. \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d and \u201cAre We There Yet\u201d have nominated her for Best Female Artist and Best Song in a number of songwriting competitions. Peacock was also named Listening Room Network\u2019s Artist of the Year.\n\nBut the dark side takes another swing. And, big Nashville promises are especially good at grave digging. From RCA Studio A golden child to street orphan practically overnight, Peacock was ghosted by her entire team and producer without explanation. Spirits crushed, she hit the road. Solo. Again. That was the catalyst that launched her next album, \u201cDream On,\u201d and landed Sarah her first tour bus. But less than 4 months later, she was watching it burn to the ground at a California truck stop. Sarah\u2019s fans quickly came to the rescue with a fundraiser, which is what kept her on the road. That special connection between Sarah and her fans is what put her in Hank Williams Jr.\u2019s former tour bus, one year after the devastating loss. \u201cYou have to be unstoppable, even when you don\u2019t believe you are.\u201d That\u2019s the Modus Operandi for the now half Tennessean, half Texan road warrior.\n\nWhen she\u2019s off the road, Peacock is active in the anti-bullying and animal rescue communities. She helped start a rock school for kids and recently formed her own 501(c)3, The Band Waggin,\u2019 benefiting animal health and rescue programs.\n\nIn 2017, she signed with In Tune Entertainment and American Roots Records. Peacock is sponsored by Taylor Guitars, Fender, 1964 Audio, Strymon, and Mississippi Cold Drip Coffee. Her upcoming EP, \u201cHot Sheet Motel,\u201d is a collection of 5 songs that reveal the secrets of one woman\u2019s journey through the shadows.\n\n\u201cSarah Peacock has a voice that\u2019s a force of nature, at times soft and nuanced and occasionally rafter-rattling powerful. \u201d\n\u2014 Sam Gazdziak (Engine 145)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Emo Night Brooklyn", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9362254.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Screamo, Punk, Emo-Pop, Emo, Post-Hardcore, Post-Rock, Throwback", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Cornerstone Craft Beer & Live Music", "moreBioInfo": "Emo Night Brooklyn is an entertainment & Event company that hosts Pop-Punk/Emo DJ Events.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "JackSymes", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10112089.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Musician, singer songwriter, American Folk, music, Folk, Indie Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "I'm Jack.

Het sfeervolle, persoonlijke album is zowel muzikaal als inhoudelijk een spannende stap vooruit. Een intensieve periode waarin onder meer de geboorte van een dochter voor een nieuw perspectief zorgde, krijgt een introspectieve, bij vlagen melancholische invulling. Vrees niet, het album blijft ver uit de buurt van een muzikale versie van het wanhopigere segment van de ingezonden brievenrubriek van de Ouders van Nu. Sterker, MTT heeft een knap, doorleefd en urgent album gemaakt, speciaal voor iedereen die weet hoe het voelt als de tijd je door de vingers glipt. De gloedvolle en wonderlijk geslaagde poging de jaren tachtig te mixen met een actuele sound, zijn een voorlopige kroon op de samenwerking tussen zangeres Anne Broekman, producer Maarten Besseling en drummer Jos Terlingen. Het resultaat sluit nog nadrukkelijker aan bij de internationale ambities die de band met het debuut over de grenzen al op de kaart zette.

At an early age Jah Sun\u2019s musical talent began to emerge. By age 12, he was a featured hip-hop artist on a local radio station. At this time in his life, Jah Sun says \u201cmusic was a salvation.\u201d As he grew a little older, he was the opening act for numerous national touring hip hop artists, including Black Moon, Masta Ace, Smiff n Wesson and The Getto Boys among many others. His talent as a hip-hop artist, was no longer a secret. When he turned 20 years old, Jah Sun discovered a musical genius who would forever change his world. That genius was Bob Marley. Jah Sun felt an automatic affinity to Marley\u2019s spiritual, mature and worldly music. The imprint Marley left on Jah Sun inspired him to expand his musical horizons and to embrace the message and movement of reggae music. Not soon after, Jah Sun decided to throw his whole being into his music. He moved to Los Angeles and made a total commitment to finding success in the music industry. His commitment, perseverance and unwavering hope soon paid-off. In 2006, Jah Sun\u2019s debut album, \u201cHeight of Light\u201d, was released. It featured many of reggae\u2019s top recording artists, such as Luciano, Junior Reid, Lutan Fyah and Grammy Award winner, Yami Bolo.

In short, \u201cHeight of Light\u201d has something to offer to everyone. The importance of the album to the reggae industry as well as to mainstream markets was soon apparent. After its release, Jah Sun was the recipient of many accolades. The song \u201cFyah Dance\u201d was nominated for the LA Music Awards\u2019 Hip-Hop Single of the Year for 2006 and the same song was featured on the 2006 season premiere of MTVs hit show, \u201cLaguna Beach\u201d. A second song, \u201cNuff a Dem\u201d was included in FUEL TV\u2019s 2007 Vans Downtown Showdown. In early 2012, Jah Sun released his breakout album \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d. The album features a host of reggae superstars, including Peetah Morgan, Alborosie, Stevie Culture, Perfect, J-Boog and Gentlemen. According to Reggaeville\u2019s Justine Amadori Ketola, the songs on \u201cBattle of the Dragon\u201d come from \u201ca wellspring of knowledge that Jah Sun possess in the teaching of Rastafari but also has the positive vibration of all spiritual practices, a sense of oneness and positivity that keeps the vibes high.\u201d Following the release of this album Jah Sun toured not only the US but also Europe, including Sweden, Spain, and Italy. The impact that \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d has had on his ever-growing fan base is phenomenal. Two of the songs from \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d were picked up by the distributors Extreme Music and SuperPop which specialize in TV and film placement. One song from the album \u201cWhere is your Love\u201d was featured on one episode of the highly successful TV program \u201cGlee\u201d. Even though it\u2019s been over a year since its release, songs from \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d as well as songs from his previously released albums continue to chart on radio stations nationwide. As his music grows in popularity, so too do his awards and award nominations. Perhaps the most notable award he has received for \u201cBattle the Dragon\u201d was at the Positive Vibrations Reggae Awards 2012 for International Album of the Year. Winning this award is a testimony to Jah Sun\u2019s ever-growing popularity not only in America but the world over.

Five years in the making, the resultant documentary, Keep On Keepin' On, won numerous awards and made the Oscar's Short List. Justin composed the film score and was subsequently signed for management by legendary producer and music icon, Quincy Jones.\n\nHicks continued on to produce a second documentary, \"Quincy.\" And, Justin went on to record on 10 albums, 3 of which he produced as leader, and brought the film, workshops & performances around the world.\n\nQuincy oversaw Justin's second and fourth full-length albums, Dedication (2015) and Coming Home (2018). Dedication debuted at #6 on CMJ Jazz chart, #10 on Billboard's Traditional Jazz Chart, hit #1 on JazzWeek's chart and remained in the top 10 spot for 9 straight weeks.\n\nJustin currently resides in Los Angeles, CA.

James quit school in grade 10 and moved to Vancouver in 1980. While trying to hook up with musicians there, he managed to open for Stevie Ray Vaughan for a show back in Regina. Vaughan was quite impressed with Colin's performance and subsequently took James on the road for several tour dates in the USA.\n\nIt was Stevie Ray Vaughan who gave Colin James his stage name.

The China Cats fall more into that last category.\" - San Jose Mercury News =============================================================== This Bay Area tribute band performs the songs of the Grateful Dead with spirited jams that carry their own genuine personality while paying homage to their musical forefathers. The band has featured many guests and shared the stage with Melvin Seals several times since 2014. Lead guitarist Matt Hartle brings experience from collaborations with Dead-family musicians, has an acclaimed body of original material, and is a founding member of Santa Cruz-based Shady Groove. Matt has shared the stage with guitarists including Henry Kaiser and Stu Allen, and is a current member of Painted Mandolin with Joe Craven. Scott has several solo albums to his credit with his band, Scott Cooper & the Barrelmakers. Keyboardist Steve Sofranko is a regular in Stu Allen & Mars Hotel. Roger formerly played bass in David Gans & the Sycamore Slough String Band and has performed with artists such as Michael Kang, David Nelson, Henry Kaiser and Frank Wakefield. Drummer Michael Owens is an in-demand player who is versed in New Orleans, jazz, reggae and African drumming. Members of the band have also performed or recorded with Stu Allen (JGB), Melvin Seals (JGB), David Nelson (NRPS), Bill Payne (Little Feat), Barry Sless (Phil & Friends, David Nelson), Ben Ellman (Galactic), Howard Wales (Jerry Garcia), Bill Laymon (New Riders), Keith Graves (Jefferson Starship, Quicksilver), George Marsh (David Grisman Quintet), Bobby Black (Hank Williams, Bob Dylan), Luka Frederickson (Wolfman Washington), Mike Schermer (Elvin Bishop, Maria Muldaur), Marc Carino (Fabulous Thunderbirds), James \"Fingers\" Shupe (Dan Hicks), (Charlie Musselwhite Band), Frank Wakefield, and many others. Armed with a large repertoire of tunes from the Dead's 150-song repertoire, the China Cats, like the Dead, do not repeat songs from one night to the next. Their repertoire spans the Dead's entire career including vintage gems such as \"St. Stephen\"; epic masterpieces like \"Terrapin Station,\" \"Help on the Way -> Slipknot\"; Bob Weir jam numbers like \"Let it Grow\" and \"Feel Like a Stranger\"; obscurities like \"Mission in the Rain\" and \"Brother Esau\", and latter-day nuggets such as \"Lazy River Road,\" \"Liberty\" and \"So Many Roads.\" Despite their various allegiances, China Cats is a full-fledged band, listening closely to one another as they share the happy tangle that defines Dead-style jams. They relish the use of familiar Dead motifs: bluegrassy phrasing on lines far outside the bluegrass idiom, group pauses with glimmering sustained notes, and overlapping scales that unfurled like maypole ribbons. ================================================== \"The China Cats are widely recognized as the top Dead tribute band in the state and for good reason. The band captures the spirit and detailed music of the Dead while adding their own subtle touch. Not just a a great tribute band, but a great band in general.\" -- Sacramento 365 \"... reviving the spirit of the legendary band than recreating each tune note for note.

As Tommy approached his teens, he discovered guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. Deeply inspired, he picked up the guitar and never looked back. A few years later Odetto was a semi-finalist for Guitar Center\u2019s King of the Blues. He was also featured in Guitar Player magazine as an artist to watch. After two successful stints with local bands, in 2016 he decided to pursue his dream of being a frontman.\n\nSince the move to fronting his own band, Tommy has been fortunate to be invited to perform at Bottlerock Napa 2018, and has opened for bands like, Chevy Metal, Tommy Castro, Coco Montoya, Y&T, Walter Trout, Uriah Heep, Ace Frehley, Trainwreck with Kyle Gass (Tenacious D) and Robin Trower to name a few. He is also a regular fill-in for Big Brother and the Holding Company. Now, only two years later, the Marin County native is celebrating his long-awaited sophomore release.\n\nCurses and Revelations is an unapologetic Rock and Roll record with themes of love lost, depression, addiction, recovery, self-discovery, and redemption.

Curses and Revelations features many standout guitar moments that are so passionate and soulful that it\u2019s as if we are witness to a musical truth serum.

It's like 1978 all over again, when U2 first stormed the pubs of Dublin, Ireland.\n\nBut this is the 21st Century in San Francisco, and the band is Zoo Station, a quartet that bills itself \"The Complete U2 Experience.\" Since 2002, this talented force has delivered the visual, musical and spiritual thrill of a U2 concert to bars, clubs, outdoor festivals, private parties and corporate events along the West Coast of North America. Singer Bonalmost leads the show, flying high with the vocal strength and confidence of Bono's The Joshua Tree days. The Sledge showers thick layers of effectual guitar work over crowd as Adamesque on bass and Barely Larry on the drums deliver the pounding heartbeat of some of modern rock's most memorable songs.\n\nThe band's primary job is replication, but periodically Zoo Station innovates as much as it imitates. During their trademark full-album spotlight sets in which the band plays an entire U2 album from start to finish Zoo Station encounters such obscurities as \"Elvis Presley and America,\" \"Promenade,\" \"Red Hill Mining Town\" and \"Acrobat,\" songs rarely or never performed live by U2.\n\n\"Songs like these are exciting,\" says Bonalmost. \"All we can really do is ask ourselves, 'What would U2 have done onstage?'\"\n\nMore familiar are melodies like \"Pride (In The Name of Love),\" \"With or Without You,\" \"Beautiful Day,\" and \"Vertigo.\" Behind the band, a multi-media visual projection system elevates Zoo Station's performances to the highest level of virtual authenticity. Swirling abstract imagery appears behind the stage, interspersed with rapid-fire \"U2-phemisms\" and in-synch flashing light choreography. All are recognizable from U2 shows, and these visual effects, centerpieced by Bonalmost's lively theatrics, reflect Zoo Station's deep-set love of U2's music and their commitment to fully recreating the dense emotional impact of a U2 concert.\n\nSince day-one, when an earnest Craigslist posting sparked the band, Zoo Station has played nearly 600 shows and now flourishes a repertoire of nearly 160 U2 songs. The sing-along radio hits appease casual listeners, while the most loyal U2 fans are wowed by the surprising depth and variety of the set list. Such thrilling rock and roll was made for vast arenas, one-acre stages and sky-high screens, and though U2 quit the bar scene in 1980, Zoo Station thrives there, doing what U2 no longer can: setting the smallest neighborhood pubs burning to life with a sound that has drowned out the world.", "otherInfo": "Zoo Station - The Complete U2 Experience at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "853 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Dona Francisca", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.421068, 37.759319], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Amnesia", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Forro music by Dona Francisca Every 2nd Friday, come dance Forro, an infectious Brazilian folksy partner swing dance that is easy to learn, a little sexy, and straight up fun."}, {"Address": "999 California St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Big", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/237914.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410248, 37.791405], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Hip Hop, Rap", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Top of the Mark", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Big City Jazz at Top of the Mark: This famed martini bar offers high-class wallpaper music on the weekends, including lounge piano, easy listening, classical, and some jazz combos.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Few Miles South", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10044778.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.460518, 37.783375], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Southern Rock, Country, Neo-Traditionalist country", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Plough & Stars", "moreBioInfo": "Few Miles South is a female fronted country and roots group created by south GA raised, Blake English, and Los Angeles native, Tori Lund.

A throng of dedicated and debauched hard partying Marbie\u2019s Barbies hurtle their way towards center stage (really\u2026they\u2019re Barbies), educated party-goers make their way to the dance floor, no questions asked, while whispers of \"King of Darkness, crazy house and techno, psychedelic vibes\u201d spread through the new night sky. The first melodic notes travel the space, ethereal beauty pouring from the stacked Funktion speakers, waving its way through the crowd. Your eyes close, your body grooves to the sounds and the beats and the thuds of the tech house that is now expertly laid out for all to enjoy. Dark and driving, thumping techno is paired with mystical, beautiful, melodic house. That passionately and expertly paired genre bending style can only mean one thing. Marbs has taken the decks. Having grown up in Southern California with the now notoriously known motley crew called Desert Hearts, Marbs, an artistic kid, was primarily influenced by legends like Pink Floyd and Tool, while also listening to underground hip hop, reggae, and rock, displaying his no holds barred love for all genres from an early age. Flash forward to San Francisco's Love Fest, art cars roaming the city, house music spilling from speakers, and Marbs\u2019 musical tastes were forever changed thanks to ruler of the house music game and party guru, Lee Burridge. After years of djing the San Diego, LA, and Burning Man party circuits, the Desert Hearts crew took it upon themselves to throw their own kind of party. One built on love, acceptance, and strictly, House and Techno, their 2012 one time gathering of 200 people in the Mojave (the coldest one ever, we swear!!) has turned into one of the most talked about and adored boutique festivals in the US. None of which could be possible without Marbs, lovingly coined, \"Papa Bear\", he is truly the backbone of the project behind the scenes, where he runs most of the logistics with a steady hand and a humble heart. He\u2019s easily one of the nicest guys on the planet and is the most modest of the crew, which is insane given his endless barrage of talents beyond his musical endeavors. While Desert Hearts catapults successfully into the scene as a major player through their twice yearly festival, touring internationally throwing parties under the moniker City Hearts, and launching a (free!) record label, Marbs continues to hone his production skills and also blows the art game out of the water, hand drawing all of the label\u2019s artwork and inspiring tattoo artists everywhere. Marbs\u2019 musical talents and humble dj presence commands any dance floor with his sounds of mystical darkness and whimsical tribal rhythms; the night sky is the limit for this King of Darkness. With a sound like no other, a heart of gold, and a determination matched by few, Marbs is sure to lead this movement of love until the very happy end.", "otherInfo": "Inquiry Collective & Public Works Present: Desert Hearts Black: Marbs, Evan Casey & Rinzen"}, {"Address": "456 Castro St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Hard", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8689754.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.435431, 37.761602], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: All Forms Of Tough Music, Hard Rock, Hdm Hard Dance Music, Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "QBar", "moreBioInfo": "Denim, sweet riffs, and leg kicks.\n\nDaniel Sowards\nCody Balaschak\nThomas Sweat\nBrady Gomillion", "otherInfo": "\"Hard\" w/ DJ Haute Toddy"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Metalachi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6995584.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Metalachi", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "Be sure to follow the entire band on their personal facebook profiles..

Shifting from University student to student of house/techno, Tolfrey quickly picked up the skills that mark out a true DJ: varied selection, an open mind, and the ability to read as well as lead a crowd. This passion for unearthing quality, moving with the times, and creating his own vision of where electronic music is heading has extended to his Leftroom imprint; now running for over 12 years and celebrating 70+ releases from artists as varied as Maceo Plex and Laura Jones to Jay Haze and DJ Bone, picking up equally varied love and support along the way. As with most DJs of his generation, the studio has also been a place for Tolfrey to experiment. Walking the walk as well as talking the talk, most of Tolfrey\u2019s output (including his well received \u2018Word of Mouth\u2019 LP) has cropped up on Leftroom, but when venturing out to other labels, there\u2019s always a link in terms of friendships and like-minded attitudes. This unshakeable focus on genuine relationships bleeds through to Tolfrey\u2019s Don\u2019t Be Leftout parties and compilations. Upon first meeting Tolfrey the words that will likely come to mind are: energetic, infectious, and the life of the party. But beyond that he\u2019s a reflective and sensitive soul who manages not to take himself too seriously despite a punishing DJ schedule and the hefty responsibilities of a label head and promoter.

Chicago\u2019s Alinka is one of them.\u2019 \u2014Terry Matthew, 5Magazine A self-described citizen of the world, Alinka spent her early life in Kiev, Ukraine before departing for Vienna in 1988, eventually landing her in her permanent home of Chicago\u2014a move that would unknowingly shape her future and solidify her fate and connection to music. Hailing from a musical family, Alinka was brought up playing the piano and was kindly placed in her room to practice from the time she could sit up on a bench. Her musical obsession grew exponentially upon landing in the US and discovering pop music like Michael Jackson and Madonna for the first time, leading her to constantly memorizing titles and making mix tapes for friends. Alinka was first exposed to dance music through the radio during the 90s, but it wasn\u2019t until she left for University that she really discovered House Music and became immersed in rave and club culture. After a year of traveling to parties, working for promoters, collecting records and continuously searching for new music, she decided to dedicate herself to learning the craft of DJing, bought a pair of Technics and set off on her mission. Less than two years later, in 2001, Alinka landed her first residency, serving as Justin Long\u2019s opener at the infamous Smart Bar Chicago for his monthly party .Dotbleep. She stayed there, honing her skills until 2008 and hasn\u2019t looked back since. In 2012, an impromptu meeting with former Hercules and Love Affair vocalist, Shaun J. Wright, changed her life forever. The pair instantly bonded over their shared love for Chicago House Music and Cajual Records, and it wasn\u2019t long before their evolving friendship resulted in what would be the first of many musical collaborations. Their debut EP, Twirl Vol.1, was promptly signed to Derrick Carter and Luke Solomon\u2019s esteemed label, Classic Music Company. The release was followed by a 12\" remix compilation with mixes from Derrick Carter, Neville Watson and Chrissy, which received worldwide acclaim and support from famed artists and publications, launching the pair into global success. In 2014, Wright and Alinka launched their own imprint, Twirl Recordings, as a follow-up to their monthly party Twirl in Chicago\u2014an event that, featuring guests like Derrick Carter, The Black Madonna, and Eli Escobar was essential in setting the tone for their own label. Their debut release, Journey Into The Deep, with remixes from renowned artists Kim Ann Foxman and Stereogamous, propelled Twirl into the spotlight, winning support from prominent artists like Heidi, Robert Owens, Annie Mac, Groove Armada, and Art Department\u2019s Kenny Glasgow. The EP also got DJ Mag's approval with a 9.0 rating, and made multiple appearances on BBC Radio 1 Dance Radio. Since its beginning, Twirl releases have been featured in Mixmag, DJ Mag, XLR8TR, BBC Radio 1, Kiss FM UK, and countless other radio shows and publications. Now on their 12th release, the label has gone on to feature a diverse range of artists including Luke Solmon, Eli Escobar, Snuff Crew, Lil\u2019 Mark, A\u00e9rea Negrot, Mijo & Macaulay, Photonz & Violet, Spatial Awareness, and many more. After a series of successful releases on Twirl, the pair continued pushing forward. 2015 saw the launch of 3 tracks as a follow-up to Twirl Vol. 1 through Classic Music Company with the track Matters Of The Heart getting a special remix treatment from The Black Madonna. The following year would bring several high-profile releases including the 3 track EP Face The Truth for Damian Lazarus\u2019 legendary Crosstown Rebels with a remix by Audiojack, followed by the EP Greed for Waifs & Strays imprint Lovecrimes with remixes by Jozif and Waifs & Strays. Between putting out original material, Wright and Alinka have been busy composing remixes for a wide range of labels and artists, most recently including Boy George for Fetch Records and Matt Tolfrey and Jozif\u2019s project Kerb Staller for Leftroom. To date, the two have had their work featured on labels like Defected, Batty Bass, Classic Music Company, Crosstown Rebels, Leftroom, Tribal America, Midnight Riot, Bargrooves , Forevergreen Ltd., and Modern Revival. 2017 brings perhaps their most exciting releases to date, an upcoming 8 track EP for Heidi\u2019s Jackathon imprint, as well as a remix for Chrissy and Mister Saturday Night\u2019s label The Night Owl Diner. In addition to her collaborations with Wright, Alinka has produced a multitude of releases and remixes for labels like Nein Records, Get Up Recordings, Audiophile Deep, Apollo Music, and Vizual. Her remix of Eli Escobar\u2019s Anotha Love was featured in Beatport\u2019s Decade In House feature, and was chosen by them as one of the top House tracks of 2014. 2016 marked a pivotal point for Alinka when she relocated to Berlin and kicked off the year with her debut appearance at the world renowned Berghain/Panorama Bar, followed by an impressive slew of gigs including Crosstown Rebels Get Lost Miami, Maya Jane Coles & Friends at Printworks London, and Ellen Allien\u2019s BPitch Boogy at Ipse Berlin. In an age of homogenized dance culture, you can trust yourself to find a unique soul committed to \u2018keeping things weird\u2019 in Alinka. Her desire to push boundaries, combined with her dedication to underground dance music, continues to move her forward and making her mark. DJ and House Music Producer from Chicago.

Born in Quebec City, Quebec, MacDonald started out performing in comedy clubs across Canada before he decided to pack his bags and move to Los Angeles. His wry style landed him gigs writing for the popular sitcom Roseanne along with The Dennis Miller Show, but a 1993 offer to write for SNL had him switching coasts and moving to New York City. A year later he was hosting the show's Weekend Update segment, delivering deadpan jokes about prison rape and crack whores that sometime received more gasps than laughs. Original Weekend Update host Chevy Chase declared him the best \"fake anchor\" he had ever seen, and while a cult of MacDonald fans was growing, the West Coast president of NBC, Don Ohlmeyer, was certainly not one of them. Ohlmeyer pressured Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels to fire MacDonald on the grounds he was \"not funny.\" MacDonald was off Weekend Update in 1997 and completely off the show in 1998, the same year he made his feature film debut with the genuine bomb Dirty Work.\n\nIn 1999 he landed a sitcom on ABC titled simply Norm. The show -- which featured his good friend and future Howard Stern sidekick Artie Lange -- struggled for three years to find an audience before it was canceled. During this time he starred in another silver screen bomb, Screwed, which was released in 2000. In 2003 he was given another chance at sitcoms with the Fox project A Minute with Stan Hooper, which only lasted six episodes despite critics' praise. He kept a low profile for the next couple years with a few talk show appearances here and there, most of them on Stern's show, where MacDonald would discuss his beloved gambling. Standup appearances around the U.S. also kept him busy until 2006, when he finished his first album. Nine years in the making, Ridiculous bucked the unambitious trend most comedy albums were following -- being nothing more than the audio companions to live performance DVDs -- and presented 12 sketches with guests like Will Ferrell, Artie Lange, Tim Meadows, and Molly Shannon.
