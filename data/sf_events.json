With their merciless dual vocal assault, intense electronic mayhem and murderous guitars, Destroyx and Zoog have thrilled and revolted countless audiences globally. Angelspit\u2019s subversive visuals are equally confronting- as their unique brand of vicious fashion and hellish aesthetics influence a new wave of cyber punk music, fashion and art.\n\nFormed in 2004 by duo ZooG and DestroyX.\nIn 2007 Angelspit toured East Coast USA with the Cr\u00fcxshadows and relocated to Berlin Germany for 12 months where they extensively toured Europe. They have played at festivals such as Wave Gotik Treffen (Germany), Castle Party (Poland) and Summer Darkness (Netherlands).\n\n\nTheir initial EP (Nurse Grenade) was released for free on the official Angelspit website, it contained an inventive mix of sampling and distortion, resulting in a style uniquely Angelpit's own, this style was refined in the independant release of their 2006 album, Krankhaus.\n\nHot off the success of their debut album Krankhaus, Angelspit have returned with a new barrage of ballistic electro punk in their new 11 track album Blood Death Ivory. The album will continue to blow fans away and disgust the status quo, as Angelspit experiment with sonic brutality combined with infectious and chemically sweetened melodies. Their tortured synthesizers, crushing bass and stomping beats get into your head and up to no good. Angelspit\u2019s fierce yet seductive vocals distort beauty with chaos, doing violence to conservativism, apathy and a society fixated with consumerism. With the massive sounding Blood Death Ivory, it\u2019s clear that Angelspit won\u2019t be silenced.\n\nwww.angelspit.net", "otherInfo": "MAY 15, 2020 : Biomechanimal (UK) Vs Mechanical Vein (NYC) Vs Angelspit (LA) - Livestream II\nJOIN US FOR A LIVESTREAM GIANT ROBOT MODULAR NOISE FIGHT!\nMore Nasty!

He played sports during the day, fixed up cars after school and eventually wrote down his experiences in song, telling not only his story, but the story of other kids raised in small town America.\n\nNow signed to EMI Records Nashville, he's able to share those songs on a grand scale, beginning with his autobiographical debut single \"Speakers, Bleachers and Preachers.\" Inspired directly by Brandon's life, the song spells out right in its title the three chief influences that shaped him. There was always country music on the radio, he played basketball, football and baseball, and his dad spread the gospel on Sundays as a minister.\n\n\"Between going to church and playing sports, there was always a lesson to be learned,\" says Brandon. \"And country music lyrics are all about life lessons. All of that helped me figure out who I am in the world and what I wanted to do.\"\n\nAt first, he thought his path would lead him to sports, but music won out, thanks in part to a guitar teacher who inspired him in college and the luck of where he was born \u2013 halfway between Memphis and Nashville. \"Growing up in Jackson, you were hearing out of each ear: rock & roll and R&B to the west in Memphis, and country to the east in Nashville,\" he says. \"But country is the only genre I wanted to be a part of. Being where I'm from, I understand it, and I think most Americans can relate because it is so specific. The most satisfying feeling as a songwriter is when people come up and say, 'I know exactly what you meant in that line.' Country does that like no other genre.\"\n\nBrandon's commitment to music was cemented, however, when he performed at his first open-mic night \u2013 at a cinder-block roadhouse near the Tennessee River. He sang jukebox staples \"Keep Your Hands to Yourself\" and \"Brown Eyed Girl,\" and despite an initial crowd of only eight people looking on, he returned every week and discovered he had a knack for commanding an audience's attention, just like his father.\n\n\"There are parallels between what I watched my dad do every Sunday morning and being onstage as a country singer,\" Brandon says. \"He was able to tell stories and relate to people, and seeing him connect with people had a lot to do with my songwriting.\"\n\nBrandon is expert at detailing the small-town existence in his songwriting. He wrote or co-wrote all of the tracks on his debut album, a project he'll unveil somewhere down the road \u2013 for the time-being, he's building an audience by releasing a series of two-song EPs, beginning with the one-two punch of \"Speakers, Bleachers and Preachers\" and the thumping cruising jam \"Let It.\"\n\n\"Songwriting comes from every direction for me. I always have titles and melodies in my phone,\" he says. One new song, called \"Yada Yada Yada,\" was half-written while Brandon was singing the wordless melody into his phone while traveling. \"But,\" he adds, \"I love writing in the studio.\"\n\nOther than perhaps the basketball court, there's nowhere Brandon feels more at home than in the recording studio. Upon signing a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell in 2013, he absorbed all he could about studio production, and when it came time to cut his own music, teamed up with producer Paul DiGiovanni to co-produce all of his songs, a rare feat for a \"new\" artist.\n\n\"It was important for me to have a thumbprint on my music as an extension of the songwriting process. Working with Paul, we were able to bridge that gap, and it\n\npersonalizes the project for me,\" he says. \"We cover a lot of ground in the songs, but I\u2019m somewhere between Eighties country and Nineties rock. I like big guitars and big drums and it has to translate on the stage.\"\n\nThe empowering \"Back on the Wagon\" contains both, balancing bombast with some plucky strings. The tale of getting over a failed romance, it's a fresh look at heartbreak, with the hurt narrator regaining his confidence through nights out riding around with friends.\n\n\"Wilder Horses\" marries synth with acoustic guitar to create the most cinematic of Brandon's songs. Written with Ross Copperman and Jon Nite, the track embodies the musical halfway point where Brandon grew up. \"The verses are bluesy like Memphis, and the chorus is very Nashville,\" he says.\n\nAnd \"Break Down on Me,\" the oldest song on the album, draws directly from his hobby of tinkering with trucks and cars. \"In high school I had a '92 F-150 that would always seem to break down on a two-lane road on the way to school, and there was no way getting around it. Everybody would see me. That's what gave me the title,\" he says of the track, about offering a caring shoulder to a girl. \"It's me saying, 'I know things are bad for you now, but I'm good at fixing things. Lay it on me.'\"\n\nWith his album already finished, Brandon \u2013 who cites Class of '89 alums like Garth Brooks and Alan Jackson as country heroes \u2013 is focusing on taking the songs on the road. He's already opened for artists like Dierks Bentley and Old Dominion, and is playing fairs and festivals around the country, bringing his story of \"Speakers, Bleachers and Preachers\" to fans who may have grown up the same way.\n\n\"I knew coming out of the gate as a new artist that my first single had to say a lot about who I am and where I come from. Hopefully, people will hear it and fill in their own blanks,\" Brandon says. \"That's my goal: for listeners to know that every line I'm singing, I've lived, and for them to find their own story in my songs.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bianca Jade Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9881966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "R&b", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bianca Jade is a Cuban-Jamaican powerhouse RnB/Soul singer and songwriter from Miami, Florida now based in New York City.

We were standing among guitar amps, drum stands, cymbals, pedals and cases that had been drenched from a faulty ceiling. We saw a heads up penny at the edge of the door and decided to do the best we could to keep our heads up and our spirits high.\nWe have been together for three years since then. In that time we\u2019ve been paying our dues. It\u2019s undoubtedly been work but we\u2019ve had a great time nonetheless. Playing cover shows week in and week out has given us the opportunity to hone our skills as musicians, learn how to run a business and figure out who we are and what we want out of this dream.\nThere\u2019s often a stigma that comes along with being in a cover band. It can be viewed as selling out. In our experience, a cover band can be an effectual incubator for something wildly original. For instance, if you\u2019re a chef, you\u2019re most likely cooking someone else's recipe. If you\u2019re a salesman, you\u2019re most likely selling someone else\u2019s product. If you're a musician (who's making any money), you're most likely playing someone else's music. And just like the chef who can go home and cook a meal inspired by his work and the salesman can go home and successfully convince his kid to eat broccoli, musicians can learn so much from playing other people's music. This is where we find much of the inspiration to create something of our own.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a lot. For one, it IS possible to make a living playing music - even though most won\u2019t suggest it and it\u2019s not easy or glamorous. For two, not having a boss is as good as it sounds. And for three, there\u2019s nothing else we\u2019d rather be doing.\nWe\u2019ve released two EP\u2019s of original music. \u201cWinnebago Soul\u201d came out in 2017 and \u201cOnward and Upward\u201d came out in 2018. Both EP\u2019s are available on all major streaming services. We learned a lot from the creation and production of those ten tunes. But having focused much of our time in the last three years to establish ourselves as a successful cover band, we haven\u2019t focused on original music as much as we would have liked. But now we are collectively ready for a paradigm shift. Of course, we will continue our business as a cover band with the utmost passion and professionalism, but now it is time to also devote serious attention to original music. January 2019 marks the beginning of recording our first full-length album. Our hearts are full and our faith is strong.

There is something strangely meditative about the lyrical sunshine-goth he creates with his evolving band in Brooklyn, NY. He attributes much of his creativity to his mother-- a painter and self-proclaimed psychic who remembers the moment she was born. She moved with her son every few years around Europe and the U.S. in hopes to find a new community. When she decided to move once again, this time to devote herself to christianity in Kansas, he decided to go his own way at sixteen years-old.\n\nHNRY FLWR is a songwriter, producer, and crooner. His 7-piece band is like seeing Leonard Cohen fronting The Flaming lips. With spiritualizing synthesizers, guitars, Ringo-esque krautrock drums and HNRY\u2019s pension for jumping into the audience, the live show is cathartic and joyful while somehow staying mysteriously earnest.\n\nIn early 2017, HNRY released two singles that landed him on Deli Magazine\u2019s Best Emerging NYC Psych playlist. By the spring his first music video was out via Alt Citizen, who called the track \u201cmelodic, danceable, and devastating.\u201d That June their \u201cbrilliant\u201d (GoldFlakePaint) debut EP, FLOWERAMA, was released on Paper Garden Records and produced by David Groener Jr who has worked with Glen Hansard, They Might Be Giants, San Fermin and many more. HNRY kept busy that year, playing 40+ shows in NYC and on tour throughout the US. By the time the year was over, the album had gone viral on Spotify with over 500,000 streams.\n\nIn 2018 the success of their breakthrough debut and immersive live shows landed them a tour supporting TEEN in the U.S. and Canada. Locally, The New York Times called them a \u201cbuzzy\u201d band during Color Me Bushwick Festival and as the buzz continued throughout the year they landed support slots with Sunflower Bean, Shy Boys, Renata Zeigur, Grandchildren, Sound of Ceres, Uni, Katie Von Schleicher, and more. To finish out the year the Wild Honey Pie produced a psychedelic Buzzsession of HNRY FLWR playing a new song in a beautiful cathedral in Brooklyn they described as \u201cintoxicating, hazy music that lifts you off the ground and transports you to another era.\u201d\n\nTo keep the momentum going in 2019 HNRY FLWR and his band did a three week tour to SXSW where they played every day of the festival, sometimes twice a day, and before returning home stopped at the famous Daytrotter/PASTE studios in Iowa for a live in-studio performance.", "otherInfo": "Tickets: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/baby-tv-presents-hnry-flwr-tickets-103971511590"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stevey LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9520864.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Americana, Folk-pop, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"An especially unique style with hints of Damien Rice, Tracy Chapman, and Ed Sheeran.\"\n\"A voice like a bearded angel.\"\n\nA former American Idol contestant and Division-I collegiate athlete, Stevey is a touring singer-songwriter currently based in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n\nStevey\u2019s sophomore album 'ABOVE' releases in late May 2019, featuring singles: by the creek, find your place, & altitude.\n\n\"This collection serves as a sequel to my 'beneath' EP. These songs all revolve around bigger ideas and forms of self-expression... dreams, epiphanies, and breakthroughs,\" he explains.\n\nHis debut album 'beneath' was released globally in 2018.\n\nStevey (born, Steve Ertl) was raised in the dirt and timber of an eastern Iowa farm, where he discovered his voice by emulating his father whistling to an old-school country vinyl spinning on the record player. He later uncovered a passion for writing imagery-centric poetry and was published at age 11.\n\nWhile enduring the grueling lifestyle of Division-I college wrestling, he and a teammate formed the R&B group, verseAtile, placing three original pieces in the independent film, \u201c7 Minutes\u201d in 2005. Stevey continued his musical pursuits post-university by teaching himself guitar, winning multiple singing competitions, amassing 200,000+ YouTube views, and ultimately began performing nationwide as a singer-songwriter in 2011.\n\nStevey has shared the stage and supported artists such as: Nathaniel Rateliff, The Nadas, The Kinky Fingers, Carry Illinois, Maxwell Hughes, Royce Lovett, RAINNE, Shane Burke, The Wendy Woo Band, Clayton Risner, Elise Wunder, Alright Alright, and The Covz.\n\nStevey\u2019s writing is poignant and conscious, which is complemented with rich, creamy, soul-wrenching vocals.

A lot has changed in their 20 plus years since the band\u2019s inception but they have always found a way to persist and thrive in todays ever-changing music landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long and adventurous trek\u201d, says Jason Devore (singer/songwriter). The band was formed in Mesa, Arizona by a group of high school friends with ample ambition but no lofty expectations of what the project could become. With the release of their debut album, A Passage in Time (2002, Lava Records), the band\u2019s career gained momentum and they quickly found themselves on the road, touring extensively with acts such as Pennywise, Sum 41, Flogging Molly, H20, and many more. Over the past ten years Authority Zero has gained international acclaim, spending time on the European festival circuit as well as stints in Australia, Russia, Japan. They have released a total of six full length studio albums, many holding spots on Billboard\u2019s Chart and their music has been featured in numerous video games, tv shows, and movie soundtracks. The band\u2019s many successes have been accompanied by a few bumps in the road including a slew of line-up changes, music industry letdowns, as well as having their van, trailer and equipment stolen while on tour in Texas. The secret to their longevity is simple; keep it pure and believe in your music.\n\nNow, 24 years since the band\u2019s inception, the future remains as bright as ever for Authority Zero, consisting of singer Jason DeVore, bassist Mike Spero, guitarist Dan Aid and drummer Chris Dalley. In June of 2018, the guys got back to work at legendary Fort Collins studio, The Blasting Room (Rise Against, Descendents, NOFX) to record their seventh full length album, Persona Non Grata with producer and iconic punk drummer, Bill Stevenson (Black Flag/Descendents/ALL). \u201cThe writing process for recording our new album (Persona Non Grata) was simply awesome. The music and lyrical content came together so organically in such a short amount of time given that our last record, Broadcasting To The Nations, only came out a year ago. Mike, Dan, Chris, and I put our hearts into this one and we are all extremely proud of the work we were able to do as a collective. The music and sound are classic Authority Zero but with a slightly revised approach. For the the fans as well as ourselves we strive to give each record its own individual character and life.\u201d Said DeVore.\n\nThe new album, Persona Non Grata will be Authority Zero\u2019s first self-released studio album and will be available on December 7, 2018. There will be an album release show on December 8th at the Marquee Theater in Tempe, Arizona. The release of Persona Non Grata will be followed by an early spring European Tour in 2019 and a summer headlining tour of the United States.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream Tour 2020 continues May 15th from our home in Arizona!

We were standing among guitar amps, drum stands, cymbals, pedals and cases that had been drenched from a faulty ceiling. We saw a heads up penny at the edge of the door and decided to do the best we could to keep our heads up and our spirits high.\nWe have been together for three years since then. In that time we\u2019ve been paying our dues. It\u2019s undoubtedly been work but we\u2019ve had a great time nonetheless. Playing cover shows week in and week out has given us the opportunity to hone our skills as musicians, learn how to run a business and figure out who we are and what we want out of this dream.\nThere\u2019s often a stigma that comes along with being in a cover band. It can be viewed as selling out. In our experience, a cover band can be an effectual incubator for something wildly original. For instance, if you\u2019re a chef, you\u2019re most likely cooking someone else's recipe. If you\u2019re a salesman, you\u2019re most likely selling someone else\u2019s product. If you're a musician (who's making any money), you're most likely playing someone else's music. And just like the chef who can go home and cook a meal inspired by his work and the salesman can go home and successfully convince his kid to eat broccoli, musicians can learn so much from playing other people's music. This is where we find much of the inspiration to create something of our own.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a lot. For one, it IS possible to make a living playing music - even though most won\u2019t suggest it and it\u2019s not easy or glamorous. For two, not having a boss is as good as it sounds. And for three, there\u2019s nothing else we\u2019d rather be doing.\nWe\u2019ve released two EP\u2019s of original music. \u201cWinnebago Soul\u201d came out in 2017 and \u201cOnward and Upward\u201d came out in 2018. Both EP\u2019s are available on all major streaming services. We learned a lot from the creation and production of those ten tunes. But having focused much of our time in the last three years to establish ourselves as a successful cover band, we haven\u2019t focused on original music as much as we would have liked. But now we are collectively ready for a paradigm shift. Of course, we will continue our business as a cover band with the utmost passion and professionalism, but now it is time to also devote serious attention to original music. January 2019 marks the beginning of recording our first full-length album. Our hearts are full and our faith is strong. We\u2019re excited to share our journey with you.", "otherInfo": "Please share, sit back, and enjoy the show!

There is something strangely meditative about the lyrical sunshine-goth he creates with his evolving band in Brooklyn, NY. He attributes much of his creativity to his mother-- a painter and self-proclaimed psychic who remembers the moment she was born. She moved with her son every few years around Europe and the U.S. in hopes to find a new community. When she decided to move once again, this time to devote herself to christianity in Kansas, he decided to go his own way at sixteen years-old.\n\nHNRY FLWR is a songwriter, producer, and crooner. His 7-piece band is like seeing Leonard Cohen fronting The Flaming lips. With spiritualizing synthesizers, guitars, Ringo-esque krautrock drums and HNRY\u2019s pension for jumping into the audience, the live show is cathartic and joyful while somehow staying mysteriously earnest.\n\nIn early 2017, HNRY released two singles that landed him on Deli Magazine\u2019s Best Emerging NYC Psych playlist. By the spring his first music video was out via Alt Citizen, who called the track \u201cmelodic, danceable, and devastating.\u201d That June their \u201cbrilliant\u201d (GoldFlakePaint) debut EP, FLOWERAMA, was released on Paper Garden Records and produced by David Groener Jr who has worked with Glen Hansard, They Might Be Giants, San Fermin and many more. HNRY kept busy that year, playing 40+ shows in NYC and on tour throughout the US. By the time the year was over, the album had gone viral on Spotify with over 500,000 streams.\n\nIn 2018 the success of their breakthrough debut and immersive live shows landed them a tour supporting TEEN in the U.S. and Canada. Locally, The New York Times called them a \u201cbuzzy\u201d band during Color Me Bushwick Festival and as the buzz continued throughout the year they landed support slots with Sunflower Bean, Shy Boys, Renata Zeigur, Grandchildren, Sound of Ceres, Uni, Katie Von Schleicher, and more. To finish out the year the Wild Honey Pie produced a psychedelic Buzzsession of HNRY FLWR playing a new song in a beautiful cathedral in Brooklyn they described as \u201cintoxicating, hazy music that lifts you off the ground and transports you to another era.\u201d\n\nTo keep the momentum going in 2019 HNRY FLWR and his band did a three week tour to SXSW where they played every day of the festival, sometimes twice a day, and before returning home stopped at the famous Daytrotter/PASTE studios in Iowa for a live in-studio performance.", "otherInfo": "Tickets: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/baby-tv-presents-hnry-flwr-tickets-103971511590"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kyla Simone LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10375971.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Christian & Gospel, Pop, Urban, Contemporary Jazz And Gospel, Acoustic Soul", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Independent music artist, songwriter, guitarist, and entrepreneur, Kyla Simone has been passionate about music and the arts since she can remember.

Maybe it comes through in how she learned to read by pouring through lyric sheets and liner notes, or how she starting singing by belting along to U2 and Shania Twain in the back of her parents\u2019 car. Or maybe it will come to light in the thousands she\u2019s raised and the miles she\u2019s logged supporting the charitable initiatives she created while still a teenager. Or maybe it will simply come across in her stunning voice and wise, insightful lyricism, all infinitely beguiling for someone of her young age. But that\u2019s the thing about Townes. She\u2019s never operated by the clock or the calendar. She operates from her heart, and from her soul.\n\nThe Canadian-born Townes, isn\u2019t quite like anyone else who has graced the city\u2019s stages. With the lyrical fortitude of Griffin or Lori McKenna, the soulful nature of Chris Stapleton or even Adele, Townes is paving ground all her own. Working on her debut LP with Jay Joyce, the Nashville-based Townes started her journey to becoming one of country\u2019s most promising new artists back in rural Canada, in the backseat of a car. \u201cI would obsess in the back seat over lyrics,\u201d says Townes, who recalls drives in her home of Grande Prairie, a small town in Alberta, Canada, with her parents. \u201cI would follow along to all of the words and sing along, and call out my favorites. Eventually, I started to learn all of the writer and producer names, just soaking it all up.\u201d\n\nTownes insisted that her parents \u2013 supportive, hard-working local entrepreneurs \u2013 sign her up for singing lessons at the age of five, which led to owning her first guitar from her grandparents at fourteen. It was perfect timing, as Townes had already started to explore what it would be like to set her poetry to music. While other kids were reading Shakespeare and studying, Townes added the craft of famed songwriters like Carolyn Dawn Johnson to her workload, developing her own narrative style before most other teenagers even headed to prom. \u201cThere were a lot of things to write about at fourteen,\u201d Townes says. \u201cI\u2019ve always craved what it felt like to step into other people\u2019s shoes. And if songwriting was a way to step into character and make someone feel less alone, then I was all in.\u201d It\u2019s telling that Townes\u2019 first song came from a conversation in social studies class \u2013 she thought about it on the entire bus ride home and hurried to her bedroom to put her feeling to words.\n\nEver since then, so many of her lyrics have come from that place of empathy and observance \u2013 a few years later, moments she\u2019s seen in passing or discussed at the dinner table with her family or wept about alongside strangers have worked their way into her sonic perspectives. Soon, she was traveling to Nashville regularly to exercise this developing talent and falling in love with everything Music City had to offer. \u201cComing here for the first time felt like walking into a dreamland,\u201d she says. She made the move to Nashville permanently four years ago, at just nineteen \u2013 driving 45 hours from Grande Prairie.\n\nOnce settled in Nashville, Townes spent her days songwriting and her nights at guitar pulls or at the Bluebird, studying everything she could. Eventually, she scored a publishing deal with Big Yellow Dog, and headed into the studio with Joyce to record her debut. Together, they tapped into her organic nature and her sheer ability to tell a story and emote it through the visceral range of her vocals \u2013 tender, bluesy, wise and full of wonder but never naive. \u201cHe has a way of pulling out people\u2019s most honest self,\u201d says Townes of her experience working with Joyce. \u201cI always loved telling stories and writing songs, and a lot of these songs deal with things that are hard to talk about. Concepts about losing someone and asking hard questions and about seeking whatever your sense of faith is. Songs about looking for love.\u201d Songs, most importantly, from the heart.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because Townes\u2019 heart is huge. At fifteen, she organized a fundraiser called Big Hearts For Big Kids benefiting a youth shelter in her home town. To this day, they\u2019ve continued it yearly and raised over $1.5 million dollars \u2013 Townes was inspired to start the event by a pamphlet her mother brought home one day, not an uncommon occurrence at her house. \u201cWe\u2019d sit around the dinner table and talk about what was going on in the world, homelessness and loneliness,\u201d she says, \u201cand I grew up being aware of those things. The parts of human existence that remind us we are all more similar than we think we are. And those stories need to be told.\u201d\n\nAfter school, she continued this ethos by launching a tour called Play It Forward, where she spent 32 weeks on the road, visiting 106 schools and playing music for over 35,000 students. Meant to encourage leadership and inspire youth, it was a huge success and completely born out of Townes\u2019 own scrappy sense of \u201canything is possible.\u201d Some of the stories she heard along the way even inspire songs on her debut LP. The idea of community that she grew up with comes through, too. Her music is that kitchen table, her words are the experiences and struggles and moments of joy she wants to share, packed with her dynamic vocals and, at the core, that heart. \u201cMusic pushes walls down you didn\u2019t know were up,\u201d she says. \u201cA song will take you places you didn\u2019t even ask it to, and I\u2019m always thankful that it does.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.cbc.ca/music/junos"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Monsieur Perin\u00e9 LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10376786.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Swing, Suin A La Colombiana, Jazz", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Monsieur Perin\u00e9 es la banda colombiana ganadora del Latin GRAMMY como \"Mejor Nuevo Artista\" en 2015, que fusiona a la perfecci\u00f3n al Jazz, el Pop y el Swing con ritmos latinos.

However, it reaches a boiling point on his forthcoming 2018 album, Western Voodoo [Heart of Gold Records].\n\nAt the same time, the Muscle Shoals, AL native stays true to what attracted countless fans in the first place.\n\n\u201cI remain open to anything you would hear coming out of a boombox,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are a lot of different vibes and angles, but it still adheres to a universal rhythm. This new record is the most musical and varied, yet it\u2019s tightly wound in respect to that syncopation. There are only a few rules. It should be heavy groove. It should make you want to move. Overall, I\u2019ve further developed the sound people are used to.\u201d\n\nFollowing up 2016\u2019s fan favorite Bits & Pieces, the artist found himself at something of a crossroads. Longtime collaborator Russ Randolph amicably parted ways with the band at the end of the year. For the first time, Godchaux would solely produce the bulk of a BoomBox record by himself inside of his new studio, while DJ Harry joined on tour in January 2017. Another first, he even performed live bass on the album, opening up the creative palette dramatically.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned more about engineering and the technical aspects of recording. It\u2019s been a time of soul searching. I can follow any Ideas that I want to. So there\u2019s a lot more organic instrumentation. I\u2019m just trying to develop more sonic real.\u201d Appropriately, he dubs the sound of Western Voodoo, \u201cDirty Disco Blues.\u201d Within that realm, Godchaux fuses a funky strut with electronic energy and danceable swagger powerful enough to cast a spell of its own.\n\n\u201cYou hear about different forms of magic around the world,\u201d he goes on. \u201cThe West, in general, has its own voodoo influenced by the blues. That\u2019s what shaped me as a musician growing up in this country. It\u2019s hard to put in the words, but you know it when you hear it.\u201d\n\nYou hear it in everything that BoomBox has done thus far. Over the course of four albums, the group has become a streaming favorite with numerous tracks cracking a million plays on Spotify. Moreover, they\u2019ve made audiences groove everywhere from Electric Forest and Hangout Music Festival to High Sierra Music Festival.\n\nIn the end, the new music kicks off the brightest and boldest chapter yet for Godchaux. \u201cOur best side is somewhat medicinal,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cAll of the rhythms, melodies, and frequencies add up to these healing properties. I hope people feel rejuvenated and re-focused on some level when they hear us.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee.

The dynamic pair are recording/performing artists, songwriters, musicians, audio engineers and producers.\n\nTheir first single, (an out-and-proud Trip Hop style song titled \"#Queen\") has achieved over 50k streams on Spotify and over 25k views on the official music video via YouTube since it's release on October 5th, 2018. Their follow up single (a soft, House track titled \"Can Be Beautiful\") was released on December 21st, 2018, and has since been featured on Billboard Sound and AXS.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel in August of 2013 and making their debut as Elvis Presley's daughter (Lisa Marie Presley)'s supporting act that same year, together they have since begun to take the music world by storm.\n\nThe duo boast a long list of live touring accomplishments and come equipped with a catalog of over 200 original songs. Their outstanding, solid fan base is made up of an array of live audiences, the YouTube community, and social media; where their popularity is ever increasing. Posting covers of both popular and original songs, live performances, v-logs, and behind-the-scenes videos weekly, their YouTube channel has recently reached an impressive tally of over 3 quarter million views overall.\n\nThe sibling duo regularly perform and tour nationally and have frequented venues such as LA's El Rey Theatre, San Juan Capistrano's The Coach House, and (just recently) have played the House of Blues in Anaheim (twice just in 2018), Bar 20 at the Grafton Hotel in Beverly Hills, the Simi Valley fireworks celebration (with over 20,000 people in attendance), at the Gibson theater in Beverly Hills, at Pickwick's Pub in Woodland Hills, a headlining show at Monterey Court in Tucson, AZ, and much more. Nicole & Scotty are currently booking for 2019, and inquiries can be emailed to ulomag28@sbcglobal.net.\n\nThey continuously entertain radio and television appearances; a few of which have included Los Angeles' Hot 103.9 Move to the Music, KHTS 98.1 FM, New York station Gold Star Radio, Las Vegas' 702 ROX, and the TV Entertainment segment Michelle's Corner. Their music is played regularly on a rapidly growing list of stations world wide, proving that the duo are not only rapidly garnering global recognition, but are also vastly appreciated and loved by their fans from all over the world.\n\nThe siblings also dabble in acting; with Scotty having co-starred in an episode of HBO's popular comedy series \"Vice Principals\", which aired October 8th, 2017.\n\nNicole & Scotty have also been featured in several major entertainment publications; including the international music trade magazine, \"Music Connection\" and the entertainment review, \"What's REALLY Going ON\", (where Nicole occasionally writes her own column and where the sister/brother duo were featured front cover in April of 2015).\n\nFrom playing shows with touring musicians who've accompanied major bands and artists (such as The Four Seasons, Barry Manilow,or John Mayer), to garnering attention from well respected industry folks, (such as producer Teddy Riley), making connections and long lasting relationships in the industry are extremely important to Nicole & Scotty.\n\nPerforming for charities and worthy causes they strongly stand for is also a passion of theirs; the siblings having played shows to raise breast cancer awareness, raise funds for youth programs, and entertain schools in the past.\n\nWhen asked, the siblings cite their brand of Pop music as \"current, energetic and brutally honest\". Their sound is indeed uniquely sincere in a genre where it is crucial to uphold the integrity of new and innovative music. The duo delivers just that by stringing raw, personal lyrics through hypnotic hooks and synth layered foundations, accompanied by thrumming bass lines and drum patterns emulating the heartbeat of their own sound. Combining an assortment of authentic Pop arrangements and Trap influence with Electronic Dance beats and rhythms, the duo offer up a wide variety of innovative and well crafted songs that translate deep rooted emotions of every nature to their listeners. As if their artistic thumbprints aren't already present enough in their recordings, a melodic acoustic and the duo's signature ambient electric guitar can be heard flitting in and out of the tunes the pair proudly create and stand by.\n\nNicole, (21), and Scotty, (17), are two young and immensely talented musicians intent on continuing a journey full of song, and wish to share the melodies in their hearts with the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Zomanno LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8333428.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Funk, Rap, Turntablism, Edm", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LA Residencies - Soho House Malibu, Soho House West Hollywood, The LINE Hotel\nNotable performances - 2017 UMF Korea, 2017 SXSW, 2017 Buku Fest, 2016 Camp Flog Gnaw", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dj Pdogg LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10381391.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Pop, Underground Hip Hop, Hip Hop, Top 40, Edm", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Pdogg #Inthemix (Durham, NC) has turned good gatherings into amazing events, by providing an experience that makes the dance floor irresistible.

These would go on to deeply shape his tastes and style. Though Ben's family lived just outside of Nashville, much of his time growing up was spent on his grandparent's farm in the town in south Georgia of Cairo. Just as with hearing various styles of music, the experiences and lessons learned from this time influenced Ben's perspective on his music. From the time he was 4 years old, Ben constantly took part in youth church choirs, school talent shows and a few different bands as he discovered more and more about his own sound as an artist. By the time he was in high school, songwriting had become a major focus and goal for him alongside the performing that he had long been captivated with. After graduating from Centennial High School in Franklin, TN, Ben was accepted to Belmont University where he currently studies Music Business. During his first three years there, he has met a number of incredible people who have further influenced his direction as an artist and a writer and continually pushed him to be better.

Day\u2019s second EP, Los Angeles, was co-written with producer/songwriter Steve Solomon (known for hits like James Arthur\u2019s \u201cSay You Won\u2019t Let Go\u201d) and peaked at number 39 on iTunes. She is known for her folk-meets-country roots, but Los Angeles has more of an experimental vibe, blending in modern sounds and merging subtle synthesizers with her acoustic guitar. Steven Ward of Grimy Goods wrote that Day has \u201ca voice that cuts like silver and a penchant for honest songwriting.\u201d\n\nDay is also a well-established actress, recurring on shows such as NBC\u2019s Parenthood and Law & Order: SVU, the Freeform drama Pretty Little Liars and MTV\u2019s Sweet/Vicious.

No Depression christened her \u201cEqual parts June Carter Cash, Nick Cave and Murder By Death.\u201d From Under the Basement magazine summed her up by saying, \u201cImagine Bill Monroe and Sid Vicious having kids together.\u201d Common Folk Music went a step further, suggesting a sound equivalent to \u201cthe glint of a switchblade held to your throat.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while Emch chose to dub her latest project the Secret Emchy Society, the truth is she\u2019s always remained clear and concise when it comes to her convictions. A singer, songwriter, author, poet, radio host and outspoken advocate for causes affecting the LGBTQ community, she\u2019s pursued both cause and craft since first opting to become a performer from the time she was a child, while singing classic cabaret songs with her mother. At age 14, she picked up her first guitar and learned to play via the Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen songbooks. Since then, her career has blossomed, thanks to time with her bands Vagabondage, Feral, Sinners Tonic, and her bluegrass band, convincingly titled Rhubarb Whiskey, whose offshoot Oakland Wine Drinkers Union, Local 88 helped broaden her musical palette. At the same time, she found herself sharing stages with other Bay Area favorites, including T Sisters, 5 Cent Coffee, Mark Growden, Pony Hunt, Foxtail Brigade, and more.\n\nAfter a succession of albums, EPs and guest appearances with such standout artists as Juno-nominated singer Carolyn Mark, the band Unwoman, and longtime collaborator Sean Malroy, Emch expanded her ambitions and founded the aforementioned Secret Emchy Society, a loose collective that features a revolving group of like-minded musicians who hop on her bandwagon during various stops along the tour. The cast currently includes Emch on vocals, guitar and accordion, Hans Winold on bass, Dillie Dauley on viola, and Eric \u201cScratch\u201d Ingerson on drums.\n\nDespite the contributions of her talented co-conspirators, the band\u2019s first offering, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville qualifies as Emch\u2019s official solo debut after years of playing and songwriting with others. She describes it as \u201can album of hard earned heartbreakers and foot stompers about good friends and hard times.\" Emch wrote all the material either in whole or with occasional input from her collaborators, making for a series of songs that rejoice and reflect, ruminate and reminisce about times both good and bad, and especially the importance of being true to one\u2019s own ideas and identity. The music celebrates a variety of vintage styles, from rowdy barn-burners and old time honky tonk, to tears-in- your beer ballads, zydeco rave-ups, and brassy collusions of country and cabaret, aiming to strike its appeal with both the mainstream and the marginalized.\n\nAs her collaborator Carolyn Mark said of Emch\u2019s music \u201cIt pairs well with whisky and hitting the streets.\u201d\n\nBased on initial impressions, the critics seem to agree. \u201cFrom the very first listen I loved this album, after which I loved it more and more with every listen...\" said Mike Morrison of AmericanRootsUK.com. \"The songs on The Stars Fall Shooting are pretty and gritty, sexy and sad,\u201d writes Jessie Lynn McMains aka Rust Belt Jessie, Racine, Wisconsin\u2019s Poet Laureate. \u201cThe music is a mix of everything from honky tonk to alt-country, to jazz and zydeco and punk, and it slides into your ears like a good blend of rye whiskies sliding down your throat. Sweet and warm, with just enough of a burn.\"\n\nNone of this ought to come as any surprise considering that Emch\u2019s literary endeavors have closely paralleled her musical output. A well recognized writer and poet, she has published five chapbooks, founded / hosted / curated the Queer Open Mic for five years, and featured at dozens of spoken word showcases including Sister Spit, the Radar Reading series, K'vetch, Writers With Drinks, as well as co-hosted a queer radio show with Lynn Breedlove. She has been interviewed on PirateCat Radio, FCC Free Radio, Revelator Radio, OutsiderWriters.com, ReadThisMagazine.co.uk, Drinks with Tony (Radio Valencia) and on NPR for her writing, her music, and, she claims, \u201cher propensity for being in car accidents that are not her fault.\u201d Notably too, she has also been featured in the Accordion Babes Calendar and was notoriously Francis Bean Cobain\u2019s favorite \u2018babe\u2019 of that year.\n\nNevertheless, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was borne from less than assuring circumstances. After burning out from years of day-job overtime, the loss of friends and family members and watching her own health decline due to the stress, Emch found herself sitting in a haunted bar in New Orleans, her spiritual second home. There she met a \u201cgrizzled and gorgeous\u201d old woman who told her, \u201cCome on honey, this is New Orleans. You gotta shake your ass!\u201d The musician took the women\u2019s admonition as a sign \u2013 it was time to get down to her real work as a musical artist.\n\nThe Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was recorded at Lucky Mouse Studios in Victoria, British Columbia, with the help of vocalist/guitarist/producer Tolan McNeil and singer/pianist Carolyn Mark who trades vocals with Emch on \u201cHad Enough.\u201d \u201cShe was the first person to put me solo on a stage with a guitar in my hands,\u201d Emch recalls. In fact, it was Mark\u2019s decision to enlist Emch as her opening act for a show at the Epicurean Connection in Sonoma, California that launched the Secret Emchy Society\u2019s first official performance. Mark also recruited members of her own band, bassist Dennis Siemens and drummer/guitarist Joel Fernandes, to assist on Secret Emchy Society\u2019s debut. Other contributors include Grayson Walker on piano and accordion, back-up vocalist J. McLaughlan and Olivier Clements on brass.\n\n\u201cI flew from Oakland to Victoria and spent four days teaching the band the songs, laying down the core tracks, and making sure we were all on the same page,\u201d Emch recalls. \u201cWhat we came up with was an impressive array of harmonies, accordion, piano, upright bass, horns, drums, a whole passel of guitars, and a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEmch, who cites Hank Williams, Hazel Dickens, Shovels & Rope, Johnny Paycheck, Charles Mingus, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Bob Wills, and the Corn Sisters as key influences, went all out when it came to gathering material for the album. \u201cThere are scraps and orphans of songs that made it onto this record that were years and years old,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are songs on this record that were less than two weeks old when they were recorded. All I know is that I threw every bit of myself into it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder then that the results are both highly personal and wholly contagious.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to offer the world is music, stories, and finding ways that I can throw the most powerful parts of myself into a few muddled chords and some danger,\u201d Emch insists.\n\nGiven those efforts, it\u2019s also clear that she\u2019s succeeded.\n\nFor more information and track by track descriptions, go to http://www.emchy.com", "otherInfo": "Join JBird McLaughlin and Secret Emchy Society as they play you some songs, tell you some tales, and give you a behind the scenes look at the making of the new album The Chaser!

No Depression christened her \u201cEqual parts June Carter Cash, Nick Cave and Murder By Death.\u201d From Under the Basement magazine summed her up by saying, \u201cImagine Bill Monroe and Sid Vicious having kids together.\u201d Common Folk Music went a step further, suggesting a sound equivalent to \u201cthe glint of a switchblade held to your throat.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while Emch chose to dub her latest project the Secret Emchy Society, the truth is she\u2019s always remained clear and concise when it comes to her convictions. A singer, songwriter, author, poet, radio host and outspoken advocate for causes affecting the LGBTQ community, she\u2019s pursued both cause and craft since first opting to become a performer from the time she was a child, while singing classic cabaret songs with her mother. At age 14, she picked up her first guitar and learned to play via the Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen songbooks. Since then, her career has blossomed, thanks to time with her bands Vagabondage, Feral, Sinners Tonic, and her bluegrass band, convincingly titled Rhubarb Whiskey, whose offshoot Oakland Wine Drinkers Union, Local 88 helped broaden her musical palette. At the same time, she found herself sharing stages with other Bay Area favorites, including T Sisters, 5 Cent Coffee, Mark Growden, Pony Hunt, Foxtail Brigade, and more.\n\nAfter a succession of albums, EPs and guest appearances with such standout artists as Juno-nominated singer Carolyn Mark, the band Unwoman, and longtime collaborator Sean Malroy, Emch expanded her ambitions and founded the aforementioned Secret Emchy Society, a loose collective that features a revolving group of like-minded musicians who hop on her bandwagon during various stops along the tour. The cast currently includes Emch on vocals, guitar and accordion, Hans Winold on bass, Dillie Dauley on viola, and Eric \u201cScratch\u201d Ingerson on drums.\n\nDespite the contributions of her talented co-conspirators, the band\u2019s first offering, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville qualifies as Emch\u2019s official solo debut after years of playing and songwriting with others. She describes it as \u201can album of hard earned heartbreakers and foot stompers about good friends and hard times.\" Emch wrote all the material either in whole or with occasional input from her collaborators, making for a series of songs that rejoice and reflect, ruminate and reminisce about times both good and bad, and especially the importance of being true to one\u2019s own ideas and identity. The music celebrates a variety of vintage styles, from rowdy barn-burners and old time honky tonk, to tears-in- your beer ballads, zydeco rave-ups, and brassy collusions of country and cabaret, aiming to strike its appeal with both the mainstream and the marginalized.\n\nAs her collaborator Carolyn Mark said of Emch\u2019s music \u201cIt pairs well with whisky and hitting the streets.\u201d\n\nBased on initial impressions, the critics seem to agree. \u201cFrom the very first listen I loved this album, after which I loved it more and more with every listen...\" said Mike Morrison of AmericanRootsUK.com. \"The songs on The Stars Fall Shooting are pretty and gritty, sexy and sad,\u201d writes Jessie Lynn McMains aka Rust Belt Jessie, Racine, Wisconsin\u2019s Poet Laureate. \u201cThe music is a mix of everything from honky tonk to alt-country, to jazz and zydeco and punk, and it slides into your ears like a good blend of rye whiskies sliding down your throat. Sweet and warm, with just enough of a burn.\"\n\nNone of this ought to come as any surprise considering that Emch\u2019s literary endeavors have closely paralleled her musical output. A well recognized writer and poet, she has published five chapbooks, founded / hosted / curated the Queer Open Mic for five years, and featured at dozens of spoken word showcases including Sister Spit, the Radar Reading series, K'vetch, Writers With Drinks, as well as co-hosted a queer radio show with Lynn Breedlove. She has been interviewed on PirateCat Radio, FCC Free Radio, Revelator Radio, OutsiderWriters.com, ReadThisMagazine.co.uk, Drinks with Tony (Radio Valencia) and on NPR for her writing, her music, and, she claims, \u201cher propensity for being in car accidents that are not her fault.\u201d Notably too, she has also been featured in the Accordion Babes Calendar and was notoriously Francis Bean Cobain\u2019s favorite \u2018babe\u2019 of that year.\n\nNevertheless, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was borne from less than assuring circumstances. After burning out from years of day-job overtime, the loss of friends and family members and watching her own health decline due to the stress, Emch found herself sitting in a haunted bar in New Orleans, her spiritual second home. There she met a \u201cgrizzled and gorgeous\u201d old woman who told her, \u201cCome on honey, this is New Orleans. You gotta shake your ass!\u201d The musician took the women\u2019s admonition as a sign \u2013 it was time to get down to her real work as a musical artist.\n\nThe Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was recorded at Lucky Mouse Studios in Victoria, British Columbia, with the help of vocalist/guitarist/producer Tolan McNeil and singer/pianist Carolyn Mark who trades vocals with Emch on \u201cHad Enough.\u201d \u201cShe was the first person to put me solo on a stage with a guitar in my hands,\u201d Emch recalls. In fact, it was Mark\u2019s decision to enlist Emch as her opening act for a show at the Epicurean Connection in Sonoma, California that launched the Secret Emchy Society\u2019s first official performance. Mark also recruited members of her own band, bassist Dennis Siemens and drummer/guitarist Joel Fernandes, to assist on Secret Emchy Society\u2019s debut. Other contributors include Grayson Walker on piano and accordion, back-up vocalist J. McLaughlan and Olivier Clements on brass.\n\n\u201cI flew from Oakland to Victoria and spent four days teaching the band the songs, laying down the core tracks, and making sure we were all on the same page,\u201d Emch recalls. \u201cWhat we came up with was an impressive array of harmonies, accordion, piano, upright bass, horns, drums, a whole passel of guitars, and a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEmch, who cites Hank Williams, Hazel Dickens, Shovels & Rope, Johnny Paycheck, Charles Mingus, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Bob Wills, and the Corn Sisters as key influences, went all out when it came to gathering material for the album. \u201cThere are scraps and orphans of songs that made it onto this record that were years and years old,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are songs on this record that were less than two weeks old when they were recorded. All I know is that I threw every bit of myself into it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder then that the results are both highly personal and wholly contagious.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to offer the world is music, stories, and finding ways that I can throw the most powerful parts of myself into a few muddled chords and some danger,\u201d Emch insists.\n\nGiven those efforts, it\u2019s also clear that she\u2019s succeeded.\n\nFor more information and track by track descriptions, go to http://www.emchy.com", "otherInfo": "Join JBird McLaughlin and Secret Emchy Society as they play you some songs, tell you some tales, and give you a behind the scenes look at the making of the new album The Chaser!

He\u2019s played four hour shows single-handedly, and traded half-hour sets at a weekly house gig at a bar in Guatemala City with \u201csome guy named Luis, who sang songs like \u2018My Way\u2019 in Spanish.

With song topics ranging from politics and religion (\u201cgod\u201d) to life as a dog (\u201cRoxygrrl\u201d), Into The Blue covers a lot of ground.

A fan on Jim\u2019s CDBaby page summed it up this way:\n\u201cJim plays because he loves music. He plays with the same passion whether he is playing for thousands or a few fans.

His uncle gave him a copy of \"The Vaughan Brothers: Family Style\" and he was hooked. He got his first SRV album shortly after, and was off into the world of Blues. He began digging deeper and deeper for the nastiest, grooviest, and raunchy sounds he could find and focused his list of influences to include Albert King, Howlin' Wolf, Hound Dog Taylor, Elmore James, Lightnin' Hopkins, Lightnin' Slim, Albert Collins, Otis Rush, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, and the list GOES ON!!

From there he moved on to other inspiring moments in music, opening for Lynard Skynard, Three Dog Night, and quite a few other notable acts.\n\nAfter graduating from school he co-formed his own group in the style of Classic Country and Rock! The band played legendary Texas venues such as Luckenbach, TX and Gruene Hall. After that Will began playing with anyone and everyone and opened solo for greats such as Dick Dale. When he was 22, he traveled to France to play with \"Mitch Webb & The Swindles\u201d at the Crappone Country Rendezvous Festival.

A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

A conformed church housed a bar in the front full of rogue townies, and a lounge in the back.\n\"Turn your phones off,\" the host of the lounge barked into the microphone. \"Turn them off, sit back, and pay attention. This guy is quiet, and he's going to tell you some stories.\"\nAnd my eyebrows raised when his hoarse voice breathed life into a quiet, rapt crowd. With his eyes closed, he sang songs - chunks of him offered up to a willing mass.\n\"I'm not a singer,\" he said eventually, looking down at his guitar. I leaned in to listen harder. \"I'm not a guitarist. I'm a song writer.\"\nIn his songs were stories and in his stories were words pushed together that took my breath away, and in his stories were words that oozed the Blood from the Before, and in his stories were ripped edges.\nI wanted to know it all. I wanted to know the names of the chunks and I wanted to inspect the hole in his chest and I wanted to know where those melodies come from and I wanted to know how he chooses the words.\nI wanted to know what he has written on the scraps of paper in his wallet and I wanted to know if his handwriting changes when he knows it's a good one.\nIt was a listening lounge, and we were supposed to be quiet and listen, but he played a song we all knew. And we sang the words with him. We couldn't help it - not one single person.\nA crooked grin formed behind the microphone and I'm fairly certain that's why he does what he does. Not for the lights. Not for the cheers. For sure not for the money.\nHe does it for the people that hear the story and say, \"Yes. Me, too. I have been there, too.\"\nIn a town out in the middle of the cornfields of Iowa, a group of people sang the words back to him that he had written. A melody chunked out of one disaster from his life, and sewn together with a rhyme, and\nmaybe that's how you heal the hurt.\n...\nVulnerability. Standing up on a stage when you'd rather be holding a pen.\nSure looks an awful lot like courage.\n\n\n- Rebecca Cooper, Author", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bridget Moynahan LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Friday Friends - playing a setlist curated by Bridget Moynahan"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Kinsey Report LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Borgore LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9622168.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Dubstep, Gorestep, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A young man following big dreams, a private beach and the olsen twins.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lisa Marshall LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10340169.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Classic Soul, Jam, Funk, Folk Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Soul-a-licious, folk-funk dusted with Rhythm and Blues is the music of Lisa Marshall.\n\"She's the little lady w/ the BIG voice! The Lisa Marshall Band takes their cues from the old school days of Soul when women more than carried their own. From Aretha to Etta to Gladys to Tina, Lisa Marshall takes it all in & churns it out true.\"- Luna Live\n\nLisa Marshall's latest CD, 'Stay Right Here' is a tribute to the music from the 60's/70's Soul explosion of Stax, Muscle Shoals, Motown and more. Use of string arrangements, three part harmony call and answer vocals ala The Sweet Inspirations, Wurlitzer and guitar licks weave the seam of the music.\n\"She is the female Otis Redding man.

Lamar Blvd., Austin, TX. The band recently headlined The Beaumont Blues and Jazz Festival , and backed the legendary Barbara Lynn on her hits such as 'You'll Loose a Good Thing' and 'I'm A Good Woman'. A true honor for Lisa with her deep love and passion for the women of early Soul/R&B and Blues.\n\nThe band's live performance is an ever evolving sound of folk/funk, garage R&B jam, and improv, taking the songs and the audience on a unique journey every performance.\n\u201cThe cocktail that is her music (a funky, soulful blues) can\u2019t really be called fusion, but more a stirred Motown mixer. Lisa Marshall is on the fast track of positioning herself as one Austin\u2019s staple female artists.\u201d -Steven Blythe, Austin Post\n\nLisa moved to Austin in Spring of 2009 and begin playing such rooms as Continental Club, Saxon Pub, and Antone\u2019s, having the opportunity to share stages with Lavelle White, Barbara Lynn, Doyle Bramhall, W.C. Clark, Patrice Pike and Sister 7, Carolyn Wonderland, Malford Milligan, Bill Carter and more.\n\nShe hails most recently from Seattle. There she performed solo with, \u201cThe Blonde\u201d, her semi-hollow body electric guitar, and was often joined by the raucous, three part call-and-answer trio, The Dirty Girls! She released her first solo CD titled \u2018Simple\u2019 in May of 2008. The group was invited to the famous Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, TN. as the feature for The Sunday \u2018Songwriter\u2019s Spotlight\u2019. \u2018Simple\u2018 can be heard in regular rotation on KOOP, KAZI ;Austin, TX., WWOZ; New Orleans, LA. and various radio in Europe as well as making it on to 2 Top 5 Euro-Americana Charts.\n\".. her (LisaMarshall) voice belts and soars through the building lyrics then dips to a restrained contralto for climatic lines. Hints of reverb in the production space add a subtle, creepy effect to the gospel tunes. It could almost be too crafted, but with Marshall's spellbinding voice pulling at the tempo, the album feels so organic that you can't imagine it any other way.\"- Rachel Dovey, Seattle Sound Magazine\nMarshall's debut solo album 'Simple' was a one woman project with Lisa recording, mixing and playing every instrument on the album except Track 1 & 3; Scotty X on Bass, Track 6; E. Pruitt on Bass, Track 3 & 4; Eric Manegold on Drums, Track 2 & 5; Kevin Fallon on Lead Guitar, Track 5; Nick Salzetti on Drums. The title track Simple drums were recorded with a single sennheiser dynamic microphone placed in the middle of the drum set above the kick drum.\n\nBorn and raised in Virginia Beach, VA, she spent her early years on the Chesapeake Bay. Her young parents possessed a large vinyl collection; Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Motown, Funk to Disco, was a constant in the house. Lisa remembers hours of sitting on the sand filled carpet with the album insert of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young 4 Way Street, reading the lyrics and singing along to 'Cowgirl In The Sand' with her younger sister. \"I have always loved harmonies. I loved that album for their harmonies. Looking back it's so fitting that I would sing that song. Living literally across the street from the beach our carpet sounded like a giant bean bag when you walked on it. I guess I thought I was the cowgirl.\" (laughs)...more like a gypsy\"\n\nAt the age of 21, Marshall moved to California. It was in L.A. where she co-founded and fronted Peculiar Boogie with Rebekah Coltman (guitar) & Susan Joyner (keys) for a decade. Their band was a unique blend of female fronted \u201cBrit\u201d Rock featuring R&B style vocals and harmonies. The band played and showcased at some of L.A\u2019s hot spots such as Troubadour, and the Roxy. Robben Ford, Koko Taylor, and Big Brother and the Holding Company are some of the acts that Peculiar Boogie supported. The band received air play in California and Europe regularly. Lisa also had the honor of singing with Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\nCurrently Lisa had been debuting new songs with her band live around Austin. She continues to create new music for an upcoming EP to be released in 2016. Lisa has been selected from over 900 musicians in Austin to the list of Black Fret/Patrons of Live Music. Her love affair with early Soul/Funk/R&B continues as she honors the broad scope of the delicious sounds.

Reed was the special guest of harmonica icon Lee Oskar that night, and her star turn at the festival was an unforgettable highlight in a career that\u2019s been chock full of them. Don\u2019t let the fairytale moment fool you, though. Reed climbed her way to success from the ground up, building a devoted audience and earning high-profile fans through grit, determination, and relentless touring. She weathered tumultuous storms and embraced bold risks without ever sacrificing her artistic independence, betting on herself and her talent even when the odds seemed stacked against her. Now, on the eve of releasing her debut collection for Blue Rose Music, it\u2019s clear that Laura Reed\u2019s gamble is paying off.\n\nRaised by a South African mother and an American father, Reed grew up listening to an eclectic mix of music from around the world. Her dad introduced her to Motown, blues, and country, while her mom shared Afropop and classic British rock. Stevie Wonder was a fixture in their home, as was the mysterious folksinger Rodriguez, who\u2019d been all but forgotten in America while he was exalted as a legend in South Africa.\n\n\u201cMy parents weren\u2019t musicians, but they were writers,\u201d says Reed. \u201cThey would tell me to pay attention to the lyrics, that the words could really make a song special.\u201d\n\nReed relocated from Johannesburg to North Carolina while she was still just a child, but her family carried their culture and traditions (as well as their love of writing) with them wherever they went. At nine years old, Reed saw her first poem published in print, and at fourteen, she picked up her first guitar.\n\n\u201cI actually taught myself how to play on my own,\u201d Reed explains. \u201cAt that age, I was always getting into trouble and being grounded, so I\u2019d spend hours every day in my room just learning chords and deconstructing songs.\u201d\n\nOpen mics and cover sets led to original recordings and homemade CDs, and before she\u2019d even finished high school, it was clear what Reed was meant to do with the rest of her life. She took her singular blend of rock, blues, and funk on the road with her band, Deep Pocket, performing more than 200 pulse-pounding shows a year and making her own breaks along the way. George Clinton discovered Reed performing on the streets of New Orleans and was so taken that he brought her into the studio, while Lee Oskar found the versatile musician on YouTube and invited her to be an ambassador for his ubiquitous harmonica brand. Reed would go on to collaborate with everyone from Killer Mike and Robert Randolph to Karl Denson and Jewel, sing the national anthem at Madison Square Garden twice, and share bills with Mali Music, India.Arie, Miguel, Valerie June and Anthony Hamilton among others.\n\nWhen Deep Pocket broke up, Reed was living in Atlanta and ready to launch a solo career. Life seemed promising at the time: she\u2019d landed a production deal, gotten married, and given birth to a beautiful baby boy. One night in the studio, though, she received a surprise visit from a childhood hero with some prophetic words.\n\n\u201cI was in singing with my back turned and suddenly someone grabbed me by my arm,\u201d remembers Reed. \u201cIt was Whitney Houston. She was holding a small little dog and she told me to keep singing. I continued to sing and she grabbed my hand and started dancing with me. At the end, she asked my name and said, \u2018You have great talent. You\u2019re as real as collard greens.\u2019 Then she looked in my eyes, really close to my face, and told me, \u2018Never stop singing. It\u2019s gonna get hard, but whatever happens, never stop.\u2019\u201d\n\nThings did indeed get hard, harder than Reed had ever imagined. Her marriage and production deal both soured, and she soon found herself scraping by as a single mother on welfare, struggling just to make ends meet. With nowhere else to turn, she called famed producer Paul Worley (Dixie Chicks, Lady Antebellum), who\u2019d become a fan and a mentor, and asked his advice.\n\n\u201cI played him some of my demos, and he told me, \u2018Put your stuff in storage and get to Nashville,\u2019\u201d remembers Reed. He told me that my one-year-old and I could come live with him and his wife while I finished writing my album.\u201d\n\nOver the next six months, Reed poured her heart and soul into writing and recording what would become her solo debut, \u2018The Awakening,\u2019 reinventing herself personally and professionally with the help of GRAMMY-winning producer Shannon Sanders (John Legend, India.Arie). The songs earned her a major publishing deal, and upon its release, the record was a critical hit, with Blurt raving that it \u201cshowcases Reed\u2019s astonishing pipes\u201d and SoulBounce calling it \u201ca refreshing blend of retro-leaning soul and pop with hints of gospel and R&B.\u201d The album\u2019s lead single, \u201cWake Up,\u201d landed in rotation at Nashville\u2019s Lightning 100, which led to public praise from the likes of Sheryl Crow and Debra Messing. Songs from the album, meanwhile, turned up in a slew of films and television shows, including Cold Light of Day (Sigourney Weaver, Henry Cavil), Chloe and Theo (Dakota Johnson, Mina Sorvino), and Alicia Keys\u2019 The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete (Jennifer Hudson, Jordin Sparks).\n\nThe record also caught the attention of the burgeoning Blue Rose Music artist collective, who presented Reed with the unique opportunity to join their prestigious roster without sacrificing any of the fiercely independent spirit that had guided her from the start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so strong willed that I need to have creative control wherever I go,\u201d explains Reed, who now calls North Carolina home once again. \u201cWhen I walked in to Blue Rose, I saw a room full of women for the first time in all my years in the music business, and I immediately felt at ease. It didn\u2019t feel like signing a typical record deal. It felt like I was joining a team that understood me.\u201d\n\nWith the team in place and the most exciting, adventurous material of her career ready to go, Laura Reed is poised to reach her biggest audiences yet, and to turn even more dreams into reality.", "otherInfo": "Streaming live with guitarist Laur Joamets, performing songs from new project \u201cLORE\u201d."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lee Quick ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8721534.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Roots, Americana, Acoustic Guitar, Acoustic Guitar Driven., Folk, Singer-songwriter", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-songwriter and classical musician from Louisiana, Lee Quick has done everything musical, probably twice.\n\nLee got a degree in music education after moonlighting as a church oboe player, a bassoon teacher, and a bass player on Bourbon Street.

But 99 Neighbors love to upend expectations. So the fact that they come from a woodsy hometown, far away from any anywhere people expect rap groups to come from, is only the beginning.\n\n\nA sprawling collective of rappers, singers, songwriters, producers, instrumentalists, and visual artists, 99 Neighbors challenges our preconceived notions of what a band even is. The lineup has evolved fluidly throughout its formation (although it\u2019s more or less set these days). No one person does just one thing, so the vocalists also make beats, and someone making beats one day might be directing a music video the next.\n\n\nIf you need help keeping them all straight (we feel you), that lineup currently consists of:\n\nSam Paulino (rapper/singer/songwriter)\n\nHank \u201cHANKNATIVE\u201d Collins (rapper/singer/songwriter)\n\nAidan Ostby (singer/songwriter)\n\nConnor \u201cSwank\u201d Stankevich (rapper/songwriter)\n\nCaleb \u201cSomba\u201d Hoh (producer/engineer/composer/songwriter)\n\nJulian \u201cJuju\u201d Segar-Reid (producer/multi-instrumentalist/composer)\n\nJared \u201cJFear\u201d Fier (DJ/producer)\n\nShane Kaseta (photographer/designer)\n\n\nLike so many other great bands, 99 Neighbors began as a friendship, or rather a couple of them. Sam and HANKNATIVE grew up together in Burlington, playing football and lacrosse together on their high school teams and rapping at house parties on weekends. Somba (the group\u2019s creative powerhouse, who has a hand in everything including production and videos) and Juju grew up together too. The two duos connected when Sam reached out to Somba over SoundCloud and realized they lived a quarter of a mile away from each other. Shane, another friend from high school, became the group\u2019s photographer and graphic designer. He was a founding member with the original vocalists and Somba when the group formed in 2018.\n\n\nAfter high school, the group\u2019s core moved in together in a dingy apartment in downtown Burlington to work on music full-time. The open-door policy they instituted quickly turned the place into a hub of the city\u2019s creative community where artists of all backgrounds and inclinations could jump into the mix (and crash on the couch if they needed to). Among them were Swank, who met the other rappers through basketball and freestyling at parties, and Aidan, who was involved when Sam and Somba first started working together, who would both become full-fledged members.\n\n\nAs 99 Neighbors grew into a collective with intentional blurry boundaries (hence the name), the core of the group squeezed into Somba\u2019s bedroom for two months to record their debut full-length, Television, an ambitious collection of songs showcasing the diversity of the group\u2019s talent, and an equally wide range of music they draw from, blending post-trap hip-hop with jazz and rock, soulful textures with electronic experimentation, undeniable hooks with the kind of hard-hitting brain-twistingly complex raps that you always hear people complaining no one\u2019s making anymore. It was at this point that Jared (a Boston native and the only member of the group not from Burlington) began DJing and producing with the group. By the time Television dropped at the beginning of 2019, 99 Neighbors was the biggest rap act in Burlington. Its reception online proved that the appeal wasn\u2019t just a local thing\u2013when the band alerted Reddit to its release their post generated so much traffic that the site took it down, mistakenly thinking it was the work of bots.\n\n\nIn February, Television single \u201cChampion\" caught the attention of Chance the Rapper\u2019s longtime manager Pat Corcoran, who soon after posted it on his Instagram. That opened up a conversation that led to a trip to Chicago, and eventually a deal to kick off a brand new collaboration between Corcoran\u2019s entertainment company Nice Work and Warner Records.\n\n\nFor the recording of their upcoming album, 99 Neighbors are going for a change of scenery. This time around they\u2019re working in a tiny town called Island Pond that\u2019s two hours north of Burlington, but the formula\u2019s still the same: a bunch of super-creative, super-talented people living in a house together and pooling their talents into something far bigger than the sum of its parts. If their work so far is any indication, you can bet that the next thing they release won\u2019t sound the same. The only thing you can ever bet on with 99 Neighbors\u2019 music is that you won\u2019t see it coming.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ms. Jackson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353345.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Garage House, House", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ms. Jackson is a dance floor filling, dirty beat making, club DJ/artist/producer.

(And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans.

The rest of the population will catch up. What this means is that Chromeo is really good at being Chromeo. The mission, the package, the vision\u2014it\u2019s been a straight shot of pure intentionality from the jump. These Chromeo dudes? They have the whole being-these-Chromeo-dudes thing totally wired.\n\nAnd with the benefit of blessed hindsight, we can all see now that Chromeo stuck to it with the natural doggedness of the soulful heirs that they are. Funk a game plan\u2014these guys had a ten-year battle strategy. When they released their first album in 2004, Rick James was still the Antichrist to all but the enlightened. Fast forward to today, and \u201880s funk\u2014which makes up a major part of Chromeo\u2019s DNA\u2014is all over the charts.\n\nSo it\u2019s the perfect time for a fresh dose of the real stuff and\u2014lo and behold\u2014Pee (still looking a smooth criminal in a Coogi) and Dave (ever the Semitic/Gallic heartthrob in tight pants) are back. We are officially on the cusp of the Canadian funk lords\u2019 fourth album\u2019s release. It\u2019s called White Women and it\u2019s a doozy. As a work of cultural theory, it posits that we are living in a post-nostalgia age. All previous genres and styles of music now coexist within a singularity of moves and gestures. (Ouch, sorry, got possessed by a cultural studies prof. for a second there\u2026 but the foregoing is true of Chromeo, just FYI.) More importantly, as pure entertainment, White Women perpetuates and elevates Chromeo\u2019s existing blueprint: sexy funk, ass-targeting beats, melodic honey, and smart lyrics about the foibles of contemporary love.\n\nDave 1\u2019s words continue to turn urban music clich\u00e9s on their heads. On \u201cJealous (I Ain\u2019t With It)\u201d, a Chromeo crossover comet if there ever was one, our arch antihero witnesses his ex in the arms of other guys\u2026 wearing the jacket that he bought her. Conversely, the pristinely produced \u201cOver Your Shoulder\u201d is a paean to the insecure. You\u2019re all beautiful, ladies, is the message; don\u2019t even sweat that body-image noise. And \u201cSexy Socialite\u201d is a warning to the highhanded party girls of the early twenty-teens. Check yourself, sayeth Chromeo.\n\nWhite Women is the band at its most ambitious, with both the pop and the muso elements of Chromeo pushed into the red. On the hooky side, we\u2019ve got instant classics like the soaring \u201cCome Alive\u201d and the pulsating \u201cFrequent Flyer\u201d which offer moments that would make Hall & Oates and Wham green with envy. On the crate-digger side, Dave and Pee employ an unprecedented analog arsenal that would make Kraftwerk drool. Mtume\u2019s female vocalist croons on more than half the album. Steely Dan\u2019s string conductor pops up on the progressive album closer \u201cFall Back 2U.\u201d Try all that on for size, nerds.\n\nBut for all that 80s talk, White Women, more so than any other Chrome-opus, is firmly grounded in pop\u2019s present. It features some stellar cameos, too. Solange belts it out with Dave 1 on \u201cLost On The Way Home,\u201d Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend contributes the piano-led, heartstring-pulling intermezzo \u201cEzra\u2019s Interlude,\u201d and Toro y Moi dives into the undiluted electro-funk of the aforementioned \u201cCome Alive.\u201d\n\n2014 happens to be the Year of the Horse, which makes sense because Chromeo are about gallop in on shining white steeds to delicately trample all of us with their sublime sound. The weather is perfect; the water is warm; the people are waiting.

Love that you walked away from so you could love yourself, unrequited love, forgiving love, love with no point to it,\" she explains.\n\nThe album opens strategically with \"Away From Love\" - the only time guitar is featured on all of Pleaser, with the rest of the album done entirely electronically. \"Away From Love\" and \"Like A Shadow\" were recorded with Darcy Baylis, while the other songs on the record were produced by Run For Cover Records labelmate Katie Dey.\n\nPleaser's 8 tracks shimmer and pulsate, calling to mind pop artists like Lorde, Robyn, Charli XCX and Gwen Stefani. \"I took more time to record the songs and play around with them, and I liked that because I could change things and experiment more,\" McDonald says, continuing \"I think the pressure of working with other people drove me to finish the songs, which I hated but also loved because it's nice to be challenged.\"\n\nWhile McDonald may have felt challenged while writing Pleaser, the experience of listening to the album is anything but difficult. Its unapologetic pop sentiments shine and delight, McDonald's gorgeous alto soaring above each track. It's a record listeners will find themselves quickly falling in love with and returning to again and again - and really, in times like these, who doesn't need more love songs?", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emma Donovan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9138028.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Soul", "Time": "9:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Acclaimed Indigenous vocalist Emma Donovan and Melbourne rhythm combo The Putbacks burst on to the Australian scene with their album Dawn in 2015, announcing a new voice in Australian soul music.

The larger-than-life beat maker made a rapid and far-reaching\nimpact on the electronic music scene in 2011 when the fittingly titled debut \u2018Entrance Song\u2019 was released on Catz N Dogz\u2019 \u2018Pets Recordings\u2019 imprint, and the track went on to become championed by the likes of Carl Cox, Seth Troxler, Jamie Jones, and Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1.\n\nHis mashup of Tiga vs Audion\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s Go Dancing\u2019 \u2013 humorously entitled \u2018Dancing (Again!)\u2019 \u2013 was one of the biggest breakthrough hits of 2015, and he was soon spinning his own unique take on one of the most iconic underground dance records of all time, Green Velvet\u2019s \u2018Flash\u2019. Eats Everything has since become one of the most in demand remixers in the business, proving his remix abilities by adding the Midas touch across a wide range of tracks from the likes of Fatboy Slim, Niles Rodgers, Jamie Jones, Disclosure, Four Tet, Matador and Booka Shade.\n\nAfter winning DJ Magazine\u2019s \u2018Best British DJ\u2019, and becoming the only DJ ever to perform two BBC Radio 1 Essential Mixes within the space of a year, Eats Everything debuted at #13 in Resident Advisor\u2019s Top\nDJs poll during 2012. A technical wizard on the decks, his obsession with House, Techno and Disco shone through immediately, displaying the \u2018studio geek\u2019 inside the Bristolian, which led to him mixing the\n\u2018Fries With That\u2019 compilation on Hypercolour Records, launching it with a very special intimate Boiler Room set in Bristol at the beginning of 2015. Stepping things up a notch, he later took on one of the\nworld\u2019s most acclaimed mix series, fabric 86, in honour of the iconic London superclub - firmly cementing him as an underground DJ.\n\nAlways one to go with the moment rather than to meticulously plan out sets, it is this party-ready approach that saw him become a key member of the elrow family early on, playing for the world-famous\nSpanish brand as an all night resident during their Ibiza season, as well as at many of their major European festival stage takeovers and club nights. All this in addition to a continuing dizzy array of high profile\ngigs; from Awakenings Festival, Movement Detroit, Kappa Futur Festival, Paradise DC10, Coachella to the Space Ibiza closing party, and his own personal favourite, Glastonbury, where his reputation as a local hero is set in stone. Now firmly established as one of the UK\u2019s finest House and Techno exports, Eats Everything has more recently become a key part RESISTANCE, which is an integral component of the ULTRA Festival brand worldwide. Regardless of his success, Eats Everything has stayed true to his roots, never forgetting where his story began, and aside from throwing parties for family, friends and his biggest fans, he has held three \u2018Food For Thought\u2019 lectures across schools in England, talking to inspired students about his musical journey and creative processes within the studio, having honed his skills since first obtaining a pair of decks at the age of 12. In addition, he became a firm advocate for the \u2018Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\u2019 charity, aiding to provide safe clean water across Africa and India by performing very special NYE performances at The Nest and fabric in London, in honour of the organisation and donating all proceeds to the charity. Making incredible music that resonates further than just the confines of underground House and Techno, the larger than life character is known for his confidence both on camera, and on radio, where his naturally gifted hosting skills have led to the headstrong producer garnering a reputation as the people\u2019s champion. Following a hugely successful 12 month stint on the BBC Radio 1 Residency, Eats Everything was quickly appointed as a deputy host for Radio 1\u2019s Dance specialist broadcasts, allowing his boisterous persona to shine through on the UK\u2019s favourite station. His radio output doesn\u2019t end there - whilst his globally syndicated weekly \u2018Edible Beats\u2019 radio show is now airing on over 70 FM stations around the world, stretching all the way from Argentina to Australia and everywhere in between, it was recently awarded best Electronic Music show and Listeners Choice for the 2018 Mixcloud radio awards.\n\nHis Edible imprint \u2013 a joint project with fellow Bristol music legend Nick Harris \u2013 continues to go from strength to strength, releasing standout tracks from the likes of Skream, Paul Woolford, Waze & Odyssey,\nEats Everything himself and newcomers like Alex Virgo. With Edible now 15 releases in, the label continues delivering high quality House, Techno and Disco influenced records that resonate broadly and\nwith a respective nod to its past.\n\nThis year sees Eats Everything launch his new A.T.E alias and event series as he looks to diversify his musical output through a combination of live branded shows, a brand new record label in collaboration with Spanish Techno hero Andres Campo, entitled EI8HT, which also provides him a platform to release no-nonsense European techno with a British twist, and to sign music from his globally renowned peers.\n\nWith 2018 already shaping up to be the biggest and best year so far in the meteoric rise of Eats Everything, the Bristolian native has a range of solid new music soon to be released on Carl Cox\u2019s infamous INTEC imprint, which is a huge honour for him and says \u201cCarl\u2019s always been a childhood hero of mine, and a really great moment in my life was when I got to play at the Discoteca in Space before him\u201d, Dense & Pika\u2019s fledgling Kneaded Pains, along with remixes for Tiga\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Special\u201d on Turbo and an \u2018Eats Rebeef\u2019 of Size 9\u2019s classic \u201cI\u2019m Ready\u201d on Josh Wink\u2019s legendary OVUM, proving Eats Everything to be one of the most consistent premiere names on the scene.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "GoldFish ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7687978.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Organic House, Melodic House, Tropical House", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Before changing the EDM game in South Africa as GoldFish, Dominic Peters and David Poole were mild-mannered students by day\u2014and blew the roof off house parties by night.

At these nights, Grooverider championed the emerging UK breakbeat culture that would eventually split from house and techno to produce Hardcore, and then after another split it became jungle, which would in turn become known as drum and bass.\n\nGrooverider remains an influential figure in the worldwide drum and bass scene, in part due to his successful radio show on BBC Radio 1 (presented in conjunction with Fabio) which has attained a devoted audience outside the United Kingdom.

It refers to those, in religion or clergy, self-proclaimed living Buddhas or liars claiming to have God's power and extraordinary abilities to carry out activities that are not religious, and are motivated by self-interest or political purposes. Most of these people are leaders of new sects. They recruit followers to help advertise their abilities and ideas, so that the public can believe in and enshrine them, enabling them to achieve their purpose of propaganda.\n\n\nThe head of the band, Chen, explained that the reason for using this name \"ZenKwun\" (the god\u2019s stick in Mandarin) for the group was that it is easy to remember, as it gives people a strong impression. Behind the name is the band\u2019s critique of society. He believes that some people in today's society, such as political figures, continue to use religion to hypnotize the public. This behavior is similar to that of a swindler or \u201cgod\u2019s stick.\u201d A large part of ZenKwun\u2019s music reflects such a phenomenon.\n\n\nThe name of the band also implies the music style. The original intention is to add elements of Hakka music; there are sounds of cymbals, suona, huqin, and Beiguan (\u5317\u7ba1) percussion music. These elements give the band\u2019s music a sense of being like temple fair music, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s associated with the words \"god\u2019s stick.\"\n\n\nWhen the audience hears the band\u2019s music, which combines Western rock music with oriental traditional instruments, they can\u2019t help but marvel that the musical instruments of their grandpa\u2019s generation \u2013 the suona, erhu, and gongs \u2013 can be used to make rock music like this!\n\n\nThe members of the band are often invited to perform at Hakka festivals, such as the annual Yimin Festival and the Tung Blossom Festival. Because their music is full of traditional religious folk elements, it sounds very lively and is very suitable for the occasions of celebration.\n\n\nThe band also participates in live house performances, in addition to performing at music festivals. In 2017, they took part in the closing ceremony of the Summer Universiade in Taipei and performed in a transnational cooperation with the Sibongie African Drumming and Dancing Crew to make the music of ZenKwun Band more diverse.\n\n\nAs an independent band, the creative concept of the ZenKwun is not only to let non-mainstream voices and sounds be heard, but also to criticize the absurd myth and the state of society in the spirit of rock and roll, and to present the strange situation from the perspective of the gods the folk beliefs. Their creative music will not only shock the audience, but also prompt them to think deeper about the insights hidden in their songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rinaly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9178985.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Trance", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rinaly is a Japanese music producer and DJ since 2014.

Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000.

In fact, with seven studio albums and more than 2.3 million Facebook fans, he is one of techno's biggest superstars. In a time where the big drops of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and cake-throwing DJs seem to reign supreme, Paul Kalkbrenner is keeping his cool. He trusts on his remarkable talent as a producer and live act\u2014no added artificial flashiness needed. He can rave with the best of them, and raise his arms to full dancefloor delirium, but his head will never spin right off.\n\nPaul Kalkbrenner's demanding compositions are full of energy; they exist to take listeners away from the everyday, from the weekly grind, into rapture\u2014into art, ecstasy, absurdity friendship, hope and love.\n\nJust 12 years old when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Kalkbrenner watched as East Berlin became an anarchic playground for a previously oppressed generation, recently freed from an overbearing state. Techno music became a way of expression and for many, Paul included, the soundtrack of Germany's reunification. In the autumn of 1992, together with his friend Sascha Funke, he started DJing at local youth clubs. Very quickly Paul and Sascha were either DJing or obsessively collecting records as electronic dance music's first tidal wave spilled over dance floors in Berlin's soon-to-be legendary clubs Tresor, Planet, Walfisch and e-werk.\n\nAt 18, he took a job at German television, spending his days sitting and editing suites watching as staid German political parties held national conferences. This would make him enough money to buy equipment to produce his own tracks. As much fun as DJing was, Paul wanted to play his own music live.\n\nHis first tracks were released on Ellen Allien's newly founded Bpitch Control label in 1999. In contrast to the darker, monotone sounds that characterized techno at the time, Paul's music was more melodic and enriched with a warm, dubby feel. After a number of 12\" singles, Paul realised he was better suited producing albums. In 2000, he released \u2018Superimpose\u2019, followed by \u2018Zeit\u2019 one year later. His third album, \u2018Self\u2019 from 2004, resonated beyond the dancefloor and took the cinematic quality of his music to new heights\u2014an indication of what was to come next.\n\nIn 2004, Berlin-based film director and self-confessed Kalkbrenner fan, Hannes Stoehr, got in touch with Paul. He was planning to make a movie about an electronic musician in Berlin's techno scene and wanted Paul to produce the soundtrack. As the script for the film developed, Hannes suggested Paul might be perfect in the starring role.\n\nTogether with his old friend Sascha Funke, he moved to Aix en Provence for six months. There, far away from Berlin's dreary winter, Paul produced some of his most diverse and mature compositions yet, which would later make up the soundtrack for \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019. He started shooting the movie upon his return to Berlin, with the result being an unconventional but outstanding performance. Somewhere between Paul Kalkbrenner and his character Ickarus, an intimate dialogue developed between actor and audience.\n\n\u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 became a surprise hit, and a German cult movie in its own right. It drew audiences all around Europe and stayed on the big screen at Berlin's Central Kino for several years. The soundtrack went platinum and the single \"Sky and Sand\", featuring his brother Fritz Kalkbrenner's vocals, spent over 121 weeks in the German singles charts\u2014a German record.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Paul split with his longtime label Bpitch Control to form his own independent imprint, Paul Kalkbrenner Musik. A sold-out European tour and a documentary followed. Made with the help of the \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 team, Max Penzel and Hannes Stoehr, \u20182010 - A Live Documentary\u2019 featured an 8-camera shoot of 15 live shows, with computer graphics created by Pfadfinderei (who also worked on \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019). The documentary remains an intimate insight into Paul's life on the road, sprinkled with his dry, deadpan humour.\n\nBetween June 2011 and November 2012 Paul released his fifth and sixth studio albums \u2018Icke Wieder\u2019 and \u2018Guten Tag\u2019. These two self-released albums are Paul's bestselling albums yet\u2014both went top five in his native Germany, with \u2018Guten Tag also topping the charts in Switzerland.\n\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Paul returned to the studio soon after, but this time made a conscious decision to take his time and explore new avenues of his sound. While working on new tracks, flipping samples and experimenting, Germany's Federal Government asked him to play a headlining live show in front of the Brandenburg Gate in a historic ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was another milestone moment in Paul's career. The framed thank-you note he received from the Government afterwards has a special place in his apartment.\n\nAfter 15 years of releasing on independent labels (ten years at Bpitch Control and five on his own label), Paul decided to take the next step and signed a long-term deal with Sony International/Columbia in March 2015. Enthused by this new chapter in his career and incited by the pressure a deal like this is usually accompanied by, Paul went back to his studio to finish his seventh studio album and create a new live show.\n\nThe album, aptly titled \u20187\u2019, was released through Columbia Records in August 2015, and it saw Paul work with vocals for the first time since his chart-topping, record-breaking single \"Sky and Sand\". In an unprecedented move by the label, Sony and Columbia provided him total access to their Legacy vaults, allowing him to incorporate vocals from previously-unsampled music icons Luther Vandross and Jefferson Airplane. The album was a success across Europe, hitting No. 1 on the charts in Austria, Switzerland, and his native Germany; and earning plaudits from the New York Times, Village Voice, Mixmag, and others.\n\nFollowing \u20187\u2019\u2019s success, Paul continued to blaze new milestones, becoming the first techno artist to grace long-running European institution Tomorrowland\u2019s main stage in July 2016. At the end of the day, though, he always comes back to his underground Berlin roots, which he celebrated with his \u201cBack to the Future\u201d mixtape series, a trilogy that chronicles his personal history of electronic music\u2019s arrival to Germany as heard on the radio during his teenage years. The series went viral, amassing over 490K downloads and 502K streams, prompting rumors of a live experience in 2017.", "otherInfo": "Hallo friends.

Born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, CA, Perry grew up in a Christian household as the daughter of two pastors. Though she was not allowed to listen to secular music as a child, Perry later found herself captivated by Alanis Morissette and Freddie Mercury, having discovered Queen's music during a slumber party. Religious music remained at the forefront, however, and Perry released a self-titled Christian album in 2001 under the name Katy Hudson. She would later abandon the genre in favor of a pop career. At age 17, the burgeoning songwriter began working with hitmaker Glen Ballard, who had produced and co-written Alanis Morissette's chart-topping Jagged Little Pill in 1995. Several years later, she teamed up with the Matrix, a Grammy-nominated production/songwriting team whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included collaborations with Avril Lavigne, Shakira, and Korn. The Matrix had plans to record their own album, with Perry serving as one of the group's two singers. The project was ultimately shelved, but not before Perry appeared in a 2004 write-up by Blender magazine, who hailed her as \"The Next Big Thing!\" With the Matrix's unreleased album sitting in the vaults at Sony Records, Perry went back to the drawing board and ultimately signed with Columbia in 2007. Her debut single, \"UR So Gay,\" generated some online buzz with its mischievous lyrics and accompanying music video, and Perry's audience grew accordingly. In 2008 her debut album, One of the Boys, was released, and she helped promote it by joining the summer's Warped Tour and appearing in an episode of The Young and the Restless. ~ Andrew Leahey & Jason Birchmeier, All Music Guide", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Georgia Nevada ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8520301.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Georgia Nevada is an 19 year old Country singer songwriter.

The repetitive beat of the primitive instrument was used in tribal ceremonies, to celebrate, bringing tribe members together and unifying their consciousness. Meanwhile the emotive responses that stem from classical compositions and string instruments are more closely connected with European ancestry. With German and Ghanaian DNA Ben Rau is blessed with the best of both cultures and the combination of influences from his forefathers permeates into his music. Infectious rhythmic grooves and emotive melodies mix together to form a rich, deep and hypnotic formula that speaks to your very soul... Ben originally fell in love with house and techno simply because he wanted to lose himself in the music and explore his deep-seated passion for music through self-expression - namely, raving. Ben spent many years tearing up dancefloors back home in Germany and in the UK, too. As time went on he became more and more involved behind the scenes, progressing from the dancefloor to the decks and into the studio. Having a solid grounding in club culture from such a grassroots level means Ben's connection with the dancefloor runs deep, likewise his studio endeavours are aimed squarely at those who dedicate their time to dancing the night away. A Berliner born and bred, Ben moved to the UK in 1999 to study Computer Animation in Bournemouth \u2013 once there, he fell in love with British culture and decided to make it his home. After a few years on the south coast he moved to London, which really cemented his hunger for music. He immersed himself in the highly influential east London party scene, having made the decision to dedicate his life to pursuing a career in music. Before he knew it Ben was tumbling down the rabbit hole and made long-lasting connections that have helped shape his career. After winning an IDJ Raw Talent competition he caught the attention of Fuse owner, Enzo Siragusa, before the party brand had been conceived. As time went on and Fuse came into being, Ben joined Enzo and the rest of the family as a resident and his career went from strength to strength. While Ben was living in the UK, Berlin had become the global epicentre of house and techno and he felt a strong calling to return home. In 2012 he decided to move back home to build a studio and he returned to Berlin with a fresh outlook, a renewed desire to succeed and the time and space to truly pursue his dreams. As 2014 begins Ben's focus has never been so strong, every waking moment is spent channeling his energy into music \u2013 resulting in extended periods in the studio, where he has accumulated an impressive collection of analogue gear. Following the advice of friend and mentor Alex Arnout , Ben has been spending his time getting to grips with his synths which allow him to explore electronic music and sound crafting in a visceral, immediate and spontaneous way \u2013 key aspects of the production process. He has also invested his spare time into taking piano lessons and learning music theory, adding a new level of musicality to his output. A long-standing relationship with London-based Save You Records continues to flourish, and his close bond with the ever-growing Fuse outfit has never been stronger. Releases are penciled in for both labels and he continues to build his skills in the studio with a clear focus on future successes. So 2014 looks set to be a pivotal year for the infectiously positive artist. With such a strong foundation, an unerring passion for his craft and so much support, Ben Rau's drum will carry on beating for many years to come...

There's the date they were crowned winners of The X Factor (December 11 2011), and when they scored their second UK Number 1 with their first single proper, Wings (September 2, 2012). But perhaps the moment the pop axis truly shifted was on June 5 2013 when the band's album, DNA, became the highest debut ever in the US Billboard Chart for a British female group's first album. It entered at Number 4 and eclipsed a sixteen-year-old record previously held by the Spice Girls\u2019 Spice album. Within two years, Perrie, Jesy, Jade and Leigh-Anne have gone from obscurity to being one of the biggest bands on the planet. Their growing success was further heightened with the release of their second album, Salute and its hit first single Move. Bold, confident, emotionally-resonate and bursting with character, Salute is a quantum leap forward from what Little Mix have done in the past. In May 2014 they embarked on their biggest UK tour, with dates including London's O2 Arena. They have also supported Demi Lovato on The Neon Lights Tour in the US. In 2015 the girls announced their third studio album, Get Weird, which is due to be released on November 6th. Black Magic, Little Mix\u2019s first single from the new album, was released on the 10th July and went straight to No. 1 in the UK charts, giving them their third No. 1 single to date. During a recent visit to the US, Little Mix gave a show stopping performance at the Teen Choice Awards as well as receiving the Choice Music: Breakout Artist Award. Their trip also included performances on The Late Late Show with James Corden, the Today Show and a special collaboration with Taylor Swift during her 1989 Tour.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade. Majestic is realising his destiny as one of the biggest talents to come out of the UK underground scene, infinitely more than just the best live MC in the game.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cinema Hearts ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10378250.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rock And Roll, Indie Rock, Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "An ex-pageant queen plays rock 'n' roll; Haunting harmonies soar over the strumming of electric guitars in Cinema Hearts' tribute to the Wall of Sound.\n\n\"...sugar sweet teen pop that cozies up tight with the mellow side of Burger Records' pop-nostalgia-via-DIY catalogue.\" - Washington City Paper\n\n\"Incorporating contemporary elements of lo-fi indie and dream pop, this innovative trio brings a sound that evokes flashes of the Greatest Generation's dance halls and of DIY basement stages.\" - The Deli Magazine\n\n\"has the potential to become America\u2019s sweethearts.\" - Brightest Young Things", "otherInfo": "Cinema Hearts partners with \"Musicians Unite! - Together, Wherever,\" a virtual music festival held every Saturday.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Let Em Riot ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10373709.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Popwave, Synthwave", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pairing dream-like synth tones and melodic vocal hooks with a chill, southern California vibe, Let Em Riot has established himself as a prominent act on the frontiers of retrowave. The artist has been innovatively mixing \u201880s nostalgia with modern music as Let Em Riot since 2010, creating a unique and compelling take on established songwriting conventions. His newest album, The Futurist, is a milestone for both himself and the synthwave genre.\n\nAlan Oakes is the one-man band behind Let Em Riot, and the diverse influences heard in his songs are the culmination of decades spent soaking up new music and playing in bands. An \u201880s baby, Oakes\u2019 earliest influences came from pop culture of the decade. Movie soundtracks were especially important in those formative years, with artists like Cyndi Lauper capturing his imagination from the reels of VHS tapes. Along with other pop acts of the era like Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode, these movie soundtracks remain prominent influences on the music of Let Em Riot.\n\nAn early love for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce also marked a pivotal point in Oakes\u2019 music interests, and rock and punk became increasingly influential as he grew into adolescence. Immersing himself in skate culture, he discovered punk bands that were integral to skate videos of the era, and those artists left a lasting impression on his creative direction.\n\nGrowing up in a southern California college town, Oakes also had plenty of opportunities to see local bands ply their craft. Watching live acts and listening to DJs spin records became a favorite pastime, and spending his days around the college\u2019s radio station introduced him to a wealth of new music including emo, ska, trance, drum and bass, and other contemporary genres.\n\nOakes joined his first band as a freshman in high school and quickly began developing his skills as a singer and guitarist. In time, his role in these acts expanded, and soon he was forming and fronting his own bands. He spent many years in this role writing music, playing shows, and doing the legwork promoting his bands, though as each new endeavor fizzled out and Oakes was left to start from scratch, he found he was tiring of the grind and felt the need to strike out on his own musical journey.\n\nThis led to the creation of Let Em Riot, a fresh and liberating solo project that combined everything Oakes had learned over the years as a music fan and artist. For the first time, he was free to synthesize his many influences into a focused, cohesive, and unmitigated musical expression of his own design. The project quickly developed a unique sound, picking up loyal followers from diverse genres along the way. In early 2018, his career hit a high mark when he released The Futurist through NewRetroWave, the leading record company in synthwave music.\n\nWith his songs reaching a new audience and shaping an exciting new genre of music, Oakes continues to refine and develop the sound of Let Em Riot without ever losing touch with his roots.", "otherInfo": "Live-streaming festival beginning at 2:00PM EST on NEON.FM\n\nPresented by: NEON, Retro Synth Records, Retro Reverb Records and Nightride FM.\n\nAlso Performing:\nVon Kaiser, Turbo Knight, Vampire Stepdad, Neon Nox, d.notive, Honey Beard, Neutron Dreams, Favourite, Blood Panic and Alex Vecchietti."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nicki Sbaffoni Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8549363.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Pop, Cover Band, Acoustic, Folk Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With a mantra of \"strum and wail\u201d, Nicki Sbaffoni consistently surprises and delights audiences with powerful and creatively twisted versions of all your favorite songs.

Das Album zeigt wieder einmal, wie gro\u00df das Talent dieses Mannes ist, einfach gute Songs zu schreiben und zu interpretieren. Im Gegensatz zum letzten Album ist der Sound hier 60er Jahre Pop mit vielen Anleihen bei den Gro\u00dfen der Zeit. Den Hamburger mit den tschechischen Wurzeln interessieren keine Schubladen, da ihm das Leben in seiner ganzen Vielfalt daf\u00fcr viel zu schade w\u00e4re.

In the following years he started his own production studio dedicating his time to produce his own material as well as developing tracks for many other artists from the romanian dance scene.\n\n2014 came with a change of scenery, switching from mainstream music to deephouse, making a great impression with the smashing remix for 'Colindul Cerbului', which boosted his brand on romanian clubbing scene, as well as outside its borders.\n\nThough he loves playing in nightclubs or festivals, his love for music goes beyond the spectrum of mixing tunes. As a producer, he has found plenty of ways to express himself musically.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about mood and a housy, hypnotic groove [\u2026] playing those tracks that get you tapping your feet and nodding your head without you realizing it, regardless of tempo, style, or release date. \u201c\n\n2017 / 2018, became one of the most airplayed dj/producer on Dance FM radio with 7 tracks, encouraging him to release the nine EP called \"Going Forward\".\n\n2020 is a year for new challenges.

Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant. The song Ginger Ale and Lorna Doones is a masterpiece, a hard hitting gut punch on every level- voice, melody, words, performance, instrumentation. I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "Each Saturday I'll be playing a lunchtime concert on FACEBOOK.COM/AMYSPEACE from my Closet (or screened in porch) during this strange time.

They never broke in the mainstream, but to a rabid underground audience, The Dangerous Summer were a phenomenon.\n\nNow, newly reformed and reunited with Hopeless Records, the band\u2014Perdomo, guitarist Matt Kennedy and drummer Ben Cato\u2014are ready to begin their second chapter with the release of their fourth full-length album in 2018, produced by James Paul Wisner (Underoath, Dashboard Confessional, Paramore).\n\n\u201cIn all of our minds, we thought this was never going to happen again,\u201d Perdomo says. \u201cThere was a point in my life where I thought I was never going to play another Dangerous Summer song again. But the easiest thing in the world is writing music and playing music together. It\u2019s second nature. It feels right again.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s forthcoming album, their first in four years, looks to build on an already accomplished discography. The Dangerous Summer\u2019s first three albums\u20142009\u2019s Reach For The Sun, 2011\u2019s War Paint and 2013\u2019s Golden Record\u2014were more than just critically acclaimed: They were collections of visceral, textured alternative rock that shook audiences to their core with an unrivaled musical heft and lyrical honesty. They were songs that demanded your attention, as catchy as they were introspectively vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking elements of what people always loved about the band and trying to push the limits and push things forward,\u201d Perdomo explains, noting that the band\u2019s new music is more uplifting and upbeat than the stark, bleak Golden Record, which came at a time of both personal and professional turmoil for the group. \u201cOn Reach For The Sun, we had a lot of inspiring songs,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like right now we need to pull out of this dark veil before we do anything else in our story. We\u2019re pulling out of the darkness, and it\u2019s really inspiring and uplifting.\u201d\n\nSo, as The Dangerous Summer approach the next stage of their career, they do so with an overwhelming optimism that\u2019s never been stronger. This isn\u2019t a rehash: It\u2019s a band acknowledging their past with eyes turned squarely toward the future. Most importantly, it\u2019s a reunion led by the music instead of the ancillary trappings of the industry. In their time away, Perdomo, Kennedy and Cato had plenty of time to figure out who and where they wanted to be, and they\u2019ve all returned to the same place.\n\n\u201cNo one owes us anything,\u201d says Perdomo, who became a father during the band\u2019s hiatus. \u201cWe have to prove ourselves again. We\u2019re giving our entire selves to this. We were always just grinding so hard because we needed to do it for a living, just trying to get by. We\u2019re not going to be grinding out 100-day tours; we conquered that.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Robert Carl Blank ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9075929.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Folk, Pop", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Zwischen Himmel und Erde passieren viele unterschiedliche Dinge, die niemand erkl\u00e4ren kann. Unter anderem wie Robert Carl Blank es alleine nur mit seiner Gitarre und Stimme schafft, eine Masse von mehr als 1000 Menschen so zu verzaubern, als w\u00fcrde er f\u00fcr jeden einzelnen singen. Der Konzertbesucher vergisst einen Abend mit dem sympathischen Fallschirmspringer aus Hamburg nur schwer, nachdem seine Songs einmal den Weg in den Geh\u00f6rgang gefunden haben. Robert ist einziges lebendes Roadmovie, der in seinen Liedern seine Erfahrung wiedergibt und das Freiheitsgef\u00fchl mit jeder Pore ausstrahlt. Mr. Blank ist der Prototyp der neuen Generation von Songwritern, die ein aufregendes, spannendes und freies Leben f\u00fchren und ihre Erfahrungen teilen wollen.\n\n\u201eWelcome all you volunteers, jokers, clowns and puppeteers\u201c hei\u00dft es gleich in der ersten Zeile seines neuen Albums \u201eFairground Distractions\u201c, das im Herbst 2016 auf den Markt kam. Robert macht hier ein gro\u00dfes emotionales Fass auf: Ein Album \u00fcber die Liebe zum Leben in seiner ganzen Unvorhersehbarkeit - die gro\u00dfe Freiheit gepaart mit bitter-s\u00fc\u00dfen R\u00fcckblicken. Es ist aber auch ein Album \u00fcber Entscheidungen im Leben geworden. Das Album zeigt wieder einmal, wie gro\u00df das Talent dieses Mannes ist, einfach gute Songs zu schreiben und zu interpretieren. Im Gegensatz zum letzten Album ist der Sound hier 60er Jahre Pop mit vielen Anleihen bei den Gro\u00dfen der Zeit. Den Hamburger mit den tschechischen Wurzeln interessieren keine Schubladen, da ihm das Leben in seiner ganzen Vielfalt daf\u00fcr viel zu schade w\u00e4re. Der inzwischen schon inflation\u00e4r gehandelte Titel des \u201eSinger/Songwriters\u201c ist bei Robert daher auch nur reine Nomenklatur, denn der Pops\u00e4nger und Songschmied ist viel mehr als das. Er ist ein rastloser und leidenschaftlicher Idealist, der sich f\u00fcr ein kompromissloses Musikerleben entschieden hat.\n\nUnber\u00fchrt von den Bequemlichkeiten des b\u00fcrgerlichen Lebens reist er bepackt mit einer Batterie von akustischen Gitarren, einem Fallschirm und einer dicken Portion Soul das ganze Jahr \u00fcber durch die Welt, sammelt Material, beobachtet und schreibt seine Eindr\u00fccke und Erfahrungen als kodierte Reiseberichte nieder. Kaum hat er ein neues Album fertig aufgenommen, gibt es schon Material f\u00fcr das n\u00e4chste. Und dabei sind seine Songs nie am Rei\u00dfbrett entstandene L\u00fcckenf\u00fcller, sondern Reisetageb\u00fccher, inspiriert von intensiven Erfahrungen auf einer selbstgebuchten Welttournee.\n\nSein erster musikalischer Reisebericht nach 10 Jahren Worldwide Travelling - das Deb\u00fctalbum \u201eSoul Circus\u201c 2008 - wurde von der Presse mit Lobeshymnen \u00fcberh\u00e4uft. Das INTRO Magazin lobte beispielsweise das liebevoll aufgenommene Album f\u00fcr seine \u201eRadiotauglichkeit\u201c und ordnete ihn als \u201eHoffnung zwischen Jack Johnson und American Idol\u201c ein. Mit seinem zweiten Album \u201eLast Time I Saw Dave\u201c (2010) konnte er sich nicht nur musikalisch weiterentwickeln, sondern auch sein Deb\u00fctalbum noch toppen. Robert Carl Blank gelang es zweifelsohne zu zeigen, dass er keine Eintagsfliege ist, und g\u00e4be es einen Soundtrack zum Leben, dann h\u00e4tte Robert ihn geschrieben \u2013 eine Wahrheit in und zwischen jedem Song, Ehrlichkeit und k\u00fcnstlerische Tiefe. Arne Schumacher (Radio Bremen) z\u00e4hlt ihn \u201eohne Zweifel zu den talentiertesten englisch textenden Singer/Songwritern in Deutschland\u201c und Heinz Rebellius (u.a.

The artist has been innovatively mixing \u201880s nostalgia with modern music as Let Em Riot since 2010, creating a unique and compelling take on established songwriting conventions. His newest album, The Futurist, is a milestone for both himself and the synthwave genre.\n\nAlan Oakes is the one-man band behind Let Em Riot, and the diverse influences heard in his songs are the culmination of decades spent soaking up new music and playing in bands. An \u201880s baby, Oakes\u2019 earliest influences came from pop culture of the decade. Movie soundtracks were especially important in those formative years, with artists like Cyndi Lauper capturing his imagination from the reels of VHS tapes. Along with other pop acts of the era like Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode, these movie soundtracks remain prominent influences on the music of Let Em Riot.\n\nAn early love for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce also marked a pivotal point in Oakes\u2019 music interests, and rock and punk became increasingly influential as he grew into adolescence. Immersing himself in skate culture, he discovered punk bands that were integral to skate videos of the era, and those artists left a lasting impression on his creative direction.\n\nGrowing up in a southern California college town, Oakes also had plenty of opportunities to see local bands ply their craft. Watching live acts and listening to DJs spin records became a favorite pastime, and spending his days around the college\u2019s radio station introduced him to a wealth of new music including emo, ska, trance, drum and bass, and other contemporary genres.\n\nOakes joined his first band as a freshman in high school and quickly began developing his skills as a singer and guitarist. In time, his role in these acts expanded, and soon he was forming and fronting his own bands. He spent many years in this role writing music, playing shows, and doing the legwork promoting his bands, though as each new endeavor fizzled out and Oakes was left to start from scratch, he found he was tiring of the grind and felt the need to strike out on his own musical journey.\n\nThis led to the creation of Let Em Riot, a fresh and liberating solo project that combined everything Oakes had learned over the years as a music fan and artist. For the first time, he was free to synthesize his many influences into a focused, cohesive, and unmitigated musical expression of his own design. The project quickly developed a unique sound, picking up loyal followers from diverse genres along the way. In early 2018, his career hit a high mark when he released The Futurist through NewRetroWave, the leading record company in synthwave music.\n\nWith his songs reaching a new audience and shaping an exciting new genre of music, Oakes continues to refine and develop the sound of Let Em Riot without ever losing touch with his roots.", "otherInfo": "Live-streaming festival beginning at 2:00PM EST on NEON.FM\n\nPresented by: NEON, Retro Synth Records, Retro Reverb Records and Nightride FM.\n\nAlso Performing:\nVon Kaiser, Turbo Knight, Vampire Stepdad, Neon Nox, d.notive, Honey Beard, Neutron Dreams, Favourite, Blood Panic and Alex Vecchietti."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Resident DJ ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anti-Flag ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Punk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "'20/20 VISION' out now! https://AntiFlag.lnk.to/2020Vision\nUK & North America tour dates are on sale now!", "otherInfo": "We are stoked to once again have an all star punx cast taking over A-F Records Instagram LIVE this Saturday for TAKEOVER FEST 3!

He has managed to combine elements of the revered canons of Western music interspersed with the audacity of jazz improvisation, and paying tribute to the ancient structures of Asian, South American and African traditional music.\n\nHe has recently signed a contract with Challenge records for a series of 10 CD's, collaborations with musicians from all over the world, based on his travels.The first trio CD will be released worldwide in the fall of 2011, and the second production in the spring of 2012, with guest artists from Brazil.\n\nMike's father was opera singer Leonard del Ferro (1921-1992), who sang and recorded with Maria Callas, and his childhood was thus filled with music of the highest order.A native of Amsterdam, he started his career studying classical piano at the age of nine and, after falling in love with jazz, he focused his studies on jazz and received a Masters of Music in Contemporary Music from the Amsterdam Conservatory.\n\nIn 1989 he won First Prize at the Rotterdam Jazz Piano Competition, the Soloist Prize at the Europe Jazz Contest in Brussels, and First Prize at the Karlovy Vary Jazz contest and from 1993-1996 studied composition and arranging with Bob Brookmeyer at the Musikhochschule in Cologne, Germany.

A few years ago, singer-songwriter Jake Benjamin made a left turn from his core self of being a musician that sent him on a winding, self-reflective odyssey through states and states of mind. He announces his return to music with his aptly-titled debut EP, Finally Back Home, an exquisite collection of jazz-tinged pop.\n\n\u201cThe songs on this EP are a culmination of stints of living in Miami, Indiana, and New Jersey, where I grew up. Each song represents a different side of me. Together, this album salutes the journey back home and presents me as I am,\u201d Jake reveals.\n\nJake is one of those rare gifted artists that early on could sing better than they could speak. Yet, when it came time to go to college, Jake decided to pursue a career as a music business professional, and chose not to fine tune his prodigious talents. However, while in college, Jake became reacquainted with songwriting and discovered the beauty of jazz. \u201cI fell in love with the fact that music could be an exchange of energies between two people,\u201d Jake shares\n\nThe New York-based artist earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from University of Miami\u2019s Frost School of Music\u2019s Music Business and Studio Music & Jazz programs, and earned his master\u2019s degree from Indiana University\u2019s prestigious Jacobs School of Music where he studied voice. Because of this formal training, core to Jake\u2019s aesthetic is his sophisticated harmonic compositional vocabulary.\n\nJake tempers this studied musicality with adventurous artistic explorations via a loop station. His innovative approach with this technology treats the loop station as a compositional tool through which he explores the possibilities of vocal layering, beatboxing, and body percussion. \u201cI write original music for the sensitive and heartfelt millenial, and I reimagine jazz repertoire to make tunes my own. The stories in my songs are about me, or somebody I know.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists. The first external track to be released was Rusch and Murray\u2019s much talked about \u2018Epic\u2019 \u2013 a track made entirely across Internet forums by two producers who\u2019ve never met \u2013, with subsequent signings including Finnish trance maestro Super8 (who later joined forces with DJ Tab), talented UK duo Smith & Pledger and Dutch Deep Tech Genius, Stephen J.Kroos.\n\nSince then, the roster has expanded to over 30 artists and Anjunabeats has earned a reputation as one the most consistent dance labels in the world, with its releases proving to be essential tools for many of the world's top DJs. In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit 3rd and Lindsley, Nashville"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Rybak ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10375384.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Americana, Blues", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "John is an established professional musical performer and plays acoustic shows around the San Francisco area.

Their sound is the bastard son of Grunge and 60\u2019s rock, with a dose of macabre-pop.

In 1998, they moved to The U.S.A., and began a new project with their cousin, Romeo Navejas. They named the band Enjambre, which means \u201cswarm\u201d (in Spanish, Navejas sounds like \u2018abejas\u2019 [bees]). In 2002, a Chilean math tutor from a nearby community college takes over as their new drummer. Enter Nicolas Saavedra. His experience as a drummer and heavy metal influence elevated the band\u2019s live performance and composition style to another dimension.\n\nEnjambre noticed that an element was missing from their sound. Osamu Nishitani was a friend of the band who they knew was a good guitarist. This Germany-born Japanese boy with a British accent fell in like a ring on to a finger. The missing link was found. His use of 80\u2019s-influenced synthesizer sound and buzz saw guitar completed the formula.\n\nEnjambre has performed with acts such as Caf\u00e9 Tacuba, Aterciopelados, Fobia, Enanitos Verdes, Jumbo, Zurdok amongst others and have visited cities like Chicago, Atlanta, Las Vegas, San Jose, San Francisco, San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nhttp://rockero.com/artists/enjambre/biography", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Petty Chavez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9651199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Acoustic", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cPetty Chavez write songs rooted in tradition but with lyrics that reflect their lives as 21st century musicians.

Thile had set himself a formidable musical challenge and, as befits this enthusiastically risk-embracing artist, he was more than up to the task. In addition to traveling, planning, rehearsing, and performing on the fifteen episodes of APHC\u2019s 2016\u201317 season, Thile managed each week to create a funny, topical, and at times quite poignant new song he would play with a rotating cast of APHC band-mates and guest stars. These were not throwaway radio bits, but smart, fully realized compositions. They served the needs of the show but were just as timely and engaging on their own.\n\nIn July 2017, Thile went into New York City\u2019s Reservoir Studios with producer and longtime friend Thomas Bartlett and that\u2019s when these songs gained an even deeper resonance. As they listened through the APHC versions, Thile and Bartlett realized that, taken together, these songs could form an album-length narrative. Part of the story Thile found was autobiographical. Thanks for Listening represents perhaps the most direct and personal material Thile has ever recorded. It reflects the changes to his own peripatetic life as he assumes a new role as APHC host and, behind the scenes, as a new dad\u2014while continuing to play with his band Punch Brothers and collaborate with such artists as Brad Mehldau, Edgar Meyer, and Yo-Yo Ma. We learn what delights him (like the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series,) and what alarms him (the polarized state of our nation post-election). But Thile also tells a broader tale\u2014satirically, wistfully, frankly\u2014 about the divisions and disconnects plaguing America today, whether it\u2019s on social media or at the Thanksgiving table. The overarching theme, Thile realized, was about the art of listening\u2014the joys of it, the current difficulties of it, and the necessity of hearing what others have to say, not just the overwhelming desire to be heard.\n\nListening, or the lack thereof, figures prominently on several tracks: \u201cFeedback Loop\u201d lampoons the way social media filters out all but those one agrees with, while \u201cModern Friendship\u201d rues the way old pals can drift apart\u2014and suggests that maybe sharing a well-made night cap could help solve that. \u201cStanley Ann\u201d is a graceful imagining of what Barack Obama might have said to his late mom as he departed the White House in January. The deceptively cheerful \u201cFalsetto,\u201d on the other hand, is an all-too-kind speculation on how the current occupant of the White House might gracelessly scold an activist entertainer\u2014managing to insult the singer\u2019s \u201cgirly falsetto\u201d in the process.\n\n\u201cMy initial working title was Get It out on the Radio\u201d (the name of the song he performs at the end of each APHC episode). But the album pivoted away from the show and toward the listeners\u2014and not just to the listeners of Prairie Home but to anyone who listens to things. They are my heroes\u2014people who listen. I find myself all too often on the other side of the conversation, talking about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to maintain focus or give something enough attention to appreciate it. We\u2019re in a place where listening is a precious commodity. That\u2019s the theme that I noticed rising up, greater than \u2018here is what was happening last week\u2019 or \u2018here is the place we were.\u2019 It\u2019s a celebration of people who haven\u2019t switched off, despite being given every reason to do so.\u201d\n\nThe arrangements have an intimate, dream-like quality to them; the songs feel like reveries, not statements. Thile\u2019s voice is at times double- or triple-tracked, cossetted by subtle echo. He delivers vocal takes that are by turns wry and soulful, frequently deploying a lovely falsetto in an especially evocative way, more Beach Boys than bluegrass. The chorus of \u201cThank You, New York,\u201d performed with singer Gaby Moreno, is a vocal stand-out, a nose-thumbing good riddance to the turbulent year that was 2016 (and a nod to the resilience of New York City and its occupants). Thile\u2019s mandolin playing remains front and center\u2014and it the sole instrument on \u201cBalboa\u201d \u2014but it is often bolstered by Bartlett\u2019s subtle, slightly mysterious, layering of keyboards and electronics.\n\n\u201cI was deeply desirous of a record that sounded like it was coming from your own head. That\u2019s where we veered away from a more archival studio approach\u2014where you go in, perform the songs, and record exactly how those performances sounded,\u201d Thile says. \u201cThe recordings on Thank You for Listening are more fanciful in construction.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I would be at the big room of Reservoir Studios making maps of these songs with whatever stringed instruments seemed appropriate and singing scratch vocals. Then Thomas would take them into his little room and start experimenting on them. And I would start the next map,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would get my pass by having written the song and having created a keep-able demo of the song and then Thomas would get his pass without me looking over his shoulder, telling him \u2018that\u2019s not how it goes.\u2019 Which I\u2019m unable to not do if I\u2019m in the room. It was like an editor editing a novel.\u201d\n\nLike Thile, multi-instrumentalist Bartlett is a musical polymath, comfortable in diverse collaborative situations. He often sits in with the National; he plays piano in the Irish Music group The Gloaming; and he occasionally performs on his own under the Doveman moniker. Rather than enlisting a full APHC-style band in the studio, the pair conceived the project largely as a musical dialogue between them\u2014a listening session of their own, if you will.\n\nThile manned all the stringed instruments, save for bass (from Alan Hampton) and viola (from Nadia Sirota, on the title track). Ted Poor\u2014like Hampton, a member of Andrew Bird\u2019s touring band\u2014played drums on five tracks. Bartlett provided, in Thile\u2019s words, \u201cwhatever sounds weren\u2019t accounted for.\u201d Thile also invited three guest singers to the sessions, all of whom had performed multiple times on APHC: Sarah Jarosz, Gaby Mereno, and Aoife O\u2019 Donovan. He says, \u201cAll three had made really meaningful contributions to how the songs ended up expressing themselves. That goes for all the musicians who played on this last APHC season. They all made such meaningful contributions to these songs. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\n\nThe original \u201cSong of the Week\u201d versions can be easily accessed via YouTube, now that all the APHC shows are live-streamed and subsequently archived. The performances are full of personality and humor, as Thile, a dependably energetic live performer, interacts with a roster of players that include various Punch Brothers, brilliant guitarist Julian Lage, and Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. Contrasting these versions with the new studio recordings, one can appreciate the sort of magical transformation that took place at Reservoir Studios, one that was more about inspiration than analysis.\n\nThe process effected a transformation on Thile too: \u201cBefore hosting Prairie Home, I would listen to music much the way an athlete trains. Listening was like hitting the gym, like a pitcher strengthening his rotator cuff. I was listening to improve specific aspects of my musicianship or nourish it in specific ways. The hosting has brought me back into being a music lover, just listening with the idea of enjoying the three to five minutes of a performance, not worrying about whether it\u2019s rendering my sense of counterpoint more sophisticated or increasing my knowledge of how sonata form works or giving me more arrows in my improvisational quiver.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u2018do I like this? Is my life better since listening to this song?\u2019 That\u2019s what I care about now.\n\n\u201cI think that development led me to ask Thomas to produce Thanks for Listening,\u201d Thile concludes. \u201cHe and I have stayed up late drinking Amaro and listening to records. I often hold vast amounts of myself back to analyze things and Thomas would consistently play me things that would disarm that side of me. I was yearning to make a set of music that maybe hits more of those marks, to have some of that rub off on me. I hope I succeeded with Thanks for Listening.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "otherInfo": "Live From Here with Chris Thile Broadcast: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3XOx7AS4fKGmu4zCaWgFA"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Justo Guitar Saborit ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9067064.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Jazz, Latin", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The best in Guitar music ever.

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe.

It is a special release in which Jask has dedicated it to his late mother who passed away July 31, 2001. Due to the successful Jacks house night in Tampa and his music productions, Jask has had the luxury of performing/djing across the United States and beyond.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

But even in their most exasperated moments, the Brooklyn-based punk trio sustains a ferocious energy and untamed joy, ultimately turning every song into a wildly cathartic anthem.\n\n\u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stifled in silence, but then the song itself is an answer to that,\u201d says Black. \u201cIt\u2019s us saying, \u2018I have my opinion, and I\u2019m going to share it no matter what.\u2019 Instead of keeping things all bottled up, it feels so much better to face everything head on, and just be really loud about it with your two best friends.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to their 2019 self-titled effort\u2014THICK\u2019s third EP and first release for Epitaph Records\u20145 Years Behind came to life at Studio G Brooklyn with producer/engineer Joel Hamilton (Iggy Pop, Jolie Holland). In a departure from their previous work, the band took a more spontaneous approach to the album-making process, sometimes completely reworking songs at the eleventh hour in order to channel the most immediate emotion into each track. \u201cIt was really important to us that the songs feel emotionally connected to our reality, so that it feel as natural as possible to play them,\u201d notes Black.\n\nAs a result of fearlessly following their instincts, THICK manage the impossible feat of coming off confident and carefree even as they expose their deepest insecurities. On the album\u2019s dynamic yet delicate title track, for instance, the band shifts from furious intensity to harmony-soaked melancholy as they reflect on certain overwhelming societal pressures. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we always feel five years behind in life, at least as far as the expectations of the world around us,\u201d says Sisti. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re constantly battling, but at the same time we know that there\u2019s no real timeline\u2014there\u2019s no time limit for doing what we want to do.\u201d\n\nTHICK\u2019s most politically charged work to date, 5 Years Behind offers up tracks like \u201cMansplain\u201d\u2014a blistering, brilliantly sarcastic takedown bookended by a sound collage of massively infuriating comments from men (e.g., \u201cGirl bands are really in right now,\u201d \u201cHere, let me help you carry your amp,\u201d \u201cAre those your boyfriend\u2019s drums?\u201d). \u201cThose are all things that men have actually said to us or our friends at shows,\u201d Page points out. On \u201cFake News,\u201d the band lets loose a 49-second blast of pure punk vitriol, spiked with scathing social commentary. And on \u201cBumming Me Out,\u201d 5 Years Behind delivers a bouncy but bittersweet epic that perfectly captures the pain of feeling powerless in the face of endless horrors happening in the world (sample lyric: \u201cNever knew I\u2019d be so tired/Fighting for what I believe\u201d).\n\nClosing out with the unrestrained fun of \u201cParty With Me\u201d\u2014as in \u201cJust take your clothes off and party with me/In the backyard of New York City\u201d\u20145 Years Behind also finds THICK looking back on their early days and on the increasingly endangered all-ages scene that birthed the band. To that end, the tenderly detailed \u201cWHUB\u201d unfolds as a heavy-hearted tribute to \u201call the DIY venues that are shut down now,\u201d as Page puts it. All originally from New York State, THICK\u2019s three members forged their friendship in those venues, with Sisti and Page forming the band in 2014 and Black joining the lineup two years later. Along with playing live as often as they could\u2014and purposely focusing on DIY/all-ages spaces all around New York\u2014THICK made their debut with the 2016 EP It\u2019s Always Something\u2026, put out their sophomore EP Would You Rather? in 2018, then signed with Epitaph later that year. \u201cFor a long time we didn\u2019t have management or a booking agent or anything\u2014we just worked our butts off and stayed true to ourselves, and it got us to where we are now,\u201d says Sisti.\n\nOver the years, THICK have earned recognition as an unstoppable live act, with their show typically spawning a mosh pit described by Stereogum as \u201cmore like an aggressive hug.\u201d As they dreamed up the tightly crafted yet uncontainable sound of 5 Years Behind, the band kept the live experience at the forefront of their minds. \u201cWhen we write, we write toward the emotions of the audience,\u201d says Sisti. \u201cI know that lyrics play a huge role in connection, but I\u2019m personally more focused on visualizing how people might physically respond to a song\u2014what it would make them feel in the moment and how it might make them move or dance.\u201d\n\nNow gearing up for a national tour in support of 5 Years Behind, THICK aspire to strengthen the palpable sense of inclusivity that\u2019s defined their shows from the start. \u201cWe want people to feel safe in the mosh pit, and hopefully connect with each other,\u201d says Page. \u201cWe\u2019ve made so many friends at the shows we\u2019ve played, and we\u2019d love it if people could build some kind of community from coming to see us.\u201d And in the making of their first full-length effort, THICK aimed to instill an undeniable feeling of solidarity into each of the album\u2019s tracks. \u201cIn a way the theme of all our songs is: \u2018We\u2019ll get through this. We\u2019re not going to be kept down,\u201d says Black. \u201cI hope when people listen to the album, it gives them that same feeling. And I hope they feel like, if they ever needed it, we\u2019d absolutely have their back.\u201d\n\nNikki Sisti (guitar, vocals) - Kate Black (bass, vocals, guitar) - Shari Page (drums, vocals)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nelly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9049470.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rap, Hip-hop, Hip Hop", "Time": "10:59 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Name at birth: Cornell Haynes, Jr.\n\nNelly became a hip-hop and pop superstar after the success of his solo 2000 release, Country Grammar.

He eventually moved to Atlanta, where he would go on to make a name for himself as one of the most prominent Southern rappers.\n\n\nEarly years\n\nBridges began his music career as a radio personality and DJ as Chris Lova Lova on Hot 97, an urban radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. He made his recorded debut on \"Phat Rabbit,\" a track from Timbaland's 1998 album Tim's Bio: Life from the Basement. Although both Timbaland and Jermaine Dupri showed interest in signing Ludacris, he decided to release the album \"Incognegro\" independently in 1999. The album sold over 50,000 copies through the Atlanta based independent music distributor, Southern Music Distribution. The same year, he recorded the theme to the video game Madden NFL 2000. Scarface, an original member of the Geto Boys, signed Ludacris in 2000 to Def Jam Recordings, and created a new imprint, Def Jam South, around him.\n\nBack for the First Time\n\nLudacris released his major label debut, Back for the First Time, in October 2000. The album reached as high as #4 on the charts, and was a major success. Ludacris made his mark on the industry with singles such as \"Southern Hospitality\" and \"What's Your Fantasy\", along with his first ever single \"Phat Rabbit\", from 2 years prior. Back for the First Time was the beginning of Ludacris's explosion to the top of the rap world.\n\nWord of Mouf\n\nLudacris promptly completed his next album, Word Of Mouf and released it at the end of 2001. Its lead single, \"Rollout (My Business)\" was boycotted in many American video stations. Despite the controversy, the video was nominated for a 2003 VMA, and Luda performed it live at the awards' pre-show. Ludacris also toured with Papa Roach in 2002 after the release of their sophomore album lovehatetragedy. Ludacris reached a new level of notoriety when TV's Bill O'Reilly expressed outrage that Pepsi had hired Ludacris as a spokesman. O'Reilly repeatedly attacked Ludacris's foul language and called for a nation-wide boycott of Pepsi, who then fired Ludacris and hired Ozzy Osbourne's family instead.\n\nChicken-N-Beer\n\nDuring the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, \"Act A Fool\" from the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. At around the same time, he released the lead single from his upcoming album, Chicken & Beer, called \"P-Poppin\" (short for \"Pussy Poppin'\"). Neither of his new singles were as well-received by either the urban or pop audiences as his previous songs had been, and both music videos received only limited airplay. Chicken & Beer opened strongly, but without a popular single, the album fell quickly.\n\nHowever, in the fall of 2003, Ludacris rebounded with his next single, \"Stand Up\", which appeared on both Chicken & Beer as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip-hop/dance movie, Honey. Produced by Kanye West, \"Stand Up\" went on to become Ludacris' biggest mainstream hit to date, hitting the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, rhythmic, and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, MTV2, and BET.\n\nThe album's next single, \"Splash Waterfalls\", was released in early 2004. Though not a pop hit, it became a success at urban radio and BET. It was Ludacris' most sexual video yet and an R&B remix that featured Raphael Saadiq and sampled Tony! Toni! Tone!'s \"Whatever You Want\". Luda next released \"Blow It Out\", a gritty song that had a heavily low-budget, gritty, and urban-looking music video, which was a huge departure from the colorful, sensual, R&B leanings depicted in \"Splash Waterfalls\". \"Blow It Out\" acted both as a scathing response to the aforementioned criticism levied by Bill O'Reilly and an expression of disgust at Pepsi's cowardice in the affair:\n\nShout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'm'a throw you a curve\nYou mad cause I'm a thief and got away with words\nI'm'a start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves\nPepsi's the New Generation?\u2014Blow it out cha ass!\n\n* On 1 June 2006, a federal jury found that \"Stand Up\" did not infringe on the copyright of a song called \"Straight Like That\" by a New Jersey group known as I.O.F. \"I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame,\" Ludacris said after the verdict. \"This whole experience is proof to me of why I will always fight for what I believe in.\"\n\nThe Red Light District\n\nThe fourth studio album from Ludacris. Although entirely different from the usual antics of the previous albums, Ludacris had taken a more mature approach to his album. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat. Ludacris had recently filmed and recorded the single \"Get Back\" in which he was featured a muscle-bounded hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned his critics to leave him alone. He also was featured on Saturday Night Live playing his song Get Back with Sum 41. The follow-up single was the Austin Powers-inspired \"The Number One Spot\". It was produced by New York City's Hot 97 personality DJ Green Lantern. It used the Quincy Jones sample of \"Soul Bossa Nova\" and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris' rap flow. Ludacris also filmed the video in which he pokes fun at O'Reilly's problems with Andrea Mackris (Hi Mr. O'Reilly / Hope all is well kiss the plaintiff and the wifey). Production credits come also from veteran producers Timbaland, Lil' Jon, The Medicine Men and legendary rapper Doug E. Fresh. Featured artists on the album include Nas, DJ Quik, DMX, Trick Daddy, and Disturbing Tha Peace newcomers Bobby Valentino (of Mista fame) and Dolla Boi and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. And most recently the rapper had used his opportunity to start his own foundation. The Ludacris Foundation started by Ludacris and Chaka Zulu is an organization that helps young middle and high school students motivate themselves in creative arts. Ludacris also has a daughter by the name of Karma. Ludacris had also participated at the Super Bowl and is the spokesman for the Boost Mobile Phone ad-campaign. Ludacris also received his first Grammy Award with Usher and Lil Jon for their hit single \"Yeah\"\n\nRelease Therapy\n\nIn a recent issue of XXL, a hip-hop based magazine, Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for Release Therapy. The album Release Therapy was released on September 26, 2006. Ludacris is going to format the cd to have two sides, a Release side and a Therapy side. With the Release side having songs that allow him to get everything off his chest and the Therapy side being just feel-good music. A song titled \"War With God\" is one of the confirmed tracks from the upcoming album. The first single, \"Money Maker\", which features Pharrell, was released to U.S. radio outlets on July 17. Others songs will be : \"Tell It Like It Is\" (Produced by Elaborate Musik Workshop), \"Runaway Love\" (Feat. Mary J. Blige) and Woozy (Feat. R. Kelly)[1] \"Money Maker\" reached number one on the BET 106 & Park Countdown for the first time on September 15, 2006. The album recently reached number 1 on the Billboard 200 album charts with sales of more than 300,000 in its first week.\n\nTo promote the album, Ludacris will be hosting and performing on Saturday Night Live 18 November. Ludacris is the second and only rapper to host and perform on the same episode (MC Hammer hosted and performed in 1991, on different episodes ).\n\nTheater of the Mind\n\nLudacris's 6th album, Theater of the Mind, is to come out in 2007.\n\nActing career\n\nLudacris has been acting in film since The Wash in 2001, but his big break came in 2005, where he received critical praise for his roles in the Oscar-winning films Hustle & Flow and Crash. Crash includes an ironic sequence where Ludacris's character is dismissive of hip-hop music. Interestingly, in both films, he is physically beaten by characters played by Terrence Howard. He is occasionally credited as \"Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges\".\n\nOn January 29, 2006 he was awarded with a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture for his work in the film Crash. Ludacris also starred in 2 Fast 2 Furious.Ludacris narrated the 2006 Ward Serrill basketball documentary \"Heart of the Game.\" Ludacris recently cut his trademark braids off to project a new image for his upcoming album, Release Therapy.\n\nHe recently appeared in the 28 March 2006 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Ludacris portrayed Darius Randall, the nephew of Detective Fin Tutuola, portrayed by Ice T.\n\nDisputes\n\nFurthering the controversy, in response to the signing of the Osbourne family, popular music hip-hop mogul, Russell Simmons, organized a boycott against the company. Simmons demanded an apology from Pepsi to Ludacris and a 5 million dollar donation to one of Ludacris' charities. Eventually Simmons and Pepsi settled on an agreement to stop the boycott, right before it was to officially begin-- while Pepsi did not formally apologize to Ludacris, they did agree to donate millions of dollars over years to Russel Simmon Hip-Hop Summit Action Network.\n\nLudacris' song \"Blow It Out\" (from the Chicken & Beer album), acted as a scathing response to his critics, namely O'Reilly.\n\nIn another song, \"Hoes in My Room\", he tells a story about anonymous prostitutes being left in his room, and at the end of the last verse he says:\n\nThen it got to my head and Somethin' remind me\n\nI know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly.\n\nThen, in 2004, in \"Number 1 Spot\"\n\nRespected highly, Hi Mr. O'Reilly.\n\nHope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris criticized Oprah Winfrey about his appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. During the interview, the conversation veered from the movie and Winfrey chose to speak on Ludacris' lyrical content, which he felt was unfair as he was visiting her show in the capacity of an actor and not a rapper. Also, Ludacris was upset that some of his responses were later edited from the show's airing. He was later joined by other rappers such as 50 Cent, Ice Cube and Killer Mike who argued that Winfrey had an anti-hip hop bias.\n\nWinfrey responded by saying that she's opposed to rap lyrics that \"marginalize women,\" but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. Ludacris later said the media had blown his comments out of proportion and said he respects Winfrey and considers her \"a great individual.\"\n\nIn 2004, before the release of his debut album Straight Outta Ca$hville, Nashville, Tennessee native and G-Unit member Young Buck would enlist the services of fellow Atlanta emcee T.I., also known as T.I.P. in his native Bankhead neighborhood of westside Atlanta. They would create a track entitled \"Stomp\" amid growing tension between Buck's good friend Ludacris and T.I. On the track, T.I. takes subliminal shots at Ludacris including the line \"me gettin' beat down, that's ludicrous.\" Buck, immediately sensing the tension, decided before releasing the track to notify Ludacris that T.I. had mentioned him since he didn't want to position himself as encouraging T.I.'s actions. Ludacris hears the track and asks Buck if he can add his own verse to which Buck agrees. The results end up being costly for T.I. as he is berated throughout Ludacris' verse and called out by name in his last line. Representatives from T.I. notify Buck that T.I.'s vocals will not be cleared for the album unless T.I. is allowed to change his verse, and also have Ludacris change his. Buck refuses this offer and T.I. prohibits his vocals from being used. Buck has hypeman and fellow rapper D-Tay replace T.I. on the song and D-Tay himself is eventually replaced by The Game on the official release.\n\nAlthough T.I. was removed, the street cut featuring him and Ludacris had already been leaked to DJs in Atlanta and New York. T.I. was unable to stop the track's distribution throughout the streets of the nation at this point. It is widely accepted that T.I. \"lost\" this battle with Ludacris easily being the victor. The beef between Ludacris and T.I. was then put to an end behind closed doors as T.I. said that the problems between them have ceased.\n\nIn 2006 however, T.I. would release his highly anticipated fourth solo album entitled KING. In his Just Blaze produced track titled \"I'm Talkin To You,\" T.I. lyrically attacks one or more unknown targets who have widely been speculated to be either Ludacris, New Orleans emcee Lil Wayne, or Houston rapper Lil' Flip (whom T.I. also had beef with but has since ended their animosity behind closed doors) or a combination of all three. It is still unknown whether or not T.I. was in fact battling Ludacris again or anyone else for that matter at all. A closer listen to the song, however proves that T.I. isnt dissing Ludacris. In one of T.I.s lines he quotes \"had it out with 'Cris, but he still my nigga...sat down civilized talked about it like niggas\", alluding to the sit down that he and Ludacris had to end their beef. As a matter of fact during the taping of MTV's My Block 'Atlanta', T.I. and Ludacris are shown greeting each other respectfully.\n\nIn July of 2006, a track entitled \"War with God\" would see Ludacris return after some time off in movies. In the track, Ludacris goes on the offensive against an unknown rapper who has sold drugs, and makes repeated references to shooting guns in his songs, isn't as rich as he (Ludacris) and likes to give himself titles - all very well known characteristics and facts directly relating to T.I and Young Jeezy (or countless other less popular rappers) or the newcoming rappers Yung Joc and Young Dro. In this instance it also unknown whether or not Ludacris is indeed aiming his disses at Young Jeezy, T.I. or if the track is even a song recorded recently. Ludacris recently stated that the song was deeper than just a diss, and the song is more about him than anyone else, it's showing that he isn't just the 'cartoon entertainer' type rapper that he has always been portrayed as, when asked about who specific rhymes were aimed at he said \"The guilty will speak\". The track has been confirmed to be a selection from Ludacris' upcoming album Release Therapy this September. The song is not aimed at Young Jeezy as he features on the latest album. \"War with God\" uses a beat written by Don Cheegro and Dirty Harry.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gabrielle Stravelli ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8941680.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cListening to the jazz singer Gabrielle Stravelli is like imbibing a potent cocktail whose flavor changes as you drain the glass\u2026a confidence and playfulness that recalled Ella Fitzgerald in her prime\u2026\u201d -The New York Times\nGabrielle Stravelli was born in New York and raised in New Jersey by parents who had very eclectic taste in music; her childhood home was full of the sounds of swing, big band, opera, R&B, gospel, musical theater and 1970s and 80s pop.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "When Particles Collide ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9454804.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Duo, Duo Rock, Indie, Indie Rock, Female Fronted Rock, Female Fronted, 90s", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "2014 New Artist of the Year - Boston Music Awards\n\nSasha and Chris met in Bangor Maine during a 2010 local production of Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

This evolution presents itself in both the physical form of the band members and the tightness of their musical maturity. Every ounce of their internal energy reserve is expelled while playing as an act of full liberation that is never clouded by taking themselves too seriously.\n\nSpending equal time in the studio and on the road, the band has earned the right to rub shoulders with some of their personal idols. From having All Time Low\u2019s Rian Dawson produce one of their tracks to opening for household names like The 1975, We The Kings and Jimmy Eat World, the band has won both online and in-person credibility for their hustle.

His new album, I Don't Dance, is a showcase for his painstaking approach to writing and recording, with his distinctive fingerprints clearly emblazoned on every element of the album. While Brice is now known as reliable chart- topping Nashville hit-maker whose 2014 performance on the Academy of Country Music telecast \u2014 where he picked up the trophy for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d\u2014 \"stole the show\" (USA Today), there was a time when he was only recognized for his work behind the scenes.\n\n\"I had success as a writer before I had success as an artist,\" says Brice, \"so there's a misconception that I was a songwriter first and then started to sing my own songs later. But all along, I've really always been writing for myself. When I started writing songs at ten years old, it was because I wanted to sing them, and when I came to Nashville, I came to be a songwriter and a singer. It's all one thing to me.\"\n\nAfter relocating from his native South Carolina to Music City, the former Clemson lineman dove headfirst into his craft, writing on his own and with a slew of talented musicians he fell in with. He found early success, with songs picked up by established artists like Jason Aldean and Keith Gattis. Though they may have been sung by other artists, those songs were stories from deep within Lee's own heart.\n\n\"'More Than A Memory' was a very personal song for me,\" he says of his breakout 2007 track. \"I was thinking about keeping it for myself when Garth Brooks called, and that changed the whole dynamic.\"\n\nIt changed a whole lot of things. Brooks' recording of the track was the first single in the history of the Billboard Hot Country Songs Chart to debut at #1. Lee's stock skyrocketed in Nashville, and that same year, he signed with Curb Records and began laying the groundwork for his inexorable rise as a solo artist.\n\nHe released his debut album, Love Like Crazy, in 2009. The title track reached #3 on the Billboard Country chart and set a record as the longest-charting song in that chart's history. In 2012, he topped his own success with Hard 2 Love, an album that went Gold and featured three #1 Country singles, including \"I Drive Your Truck,\" which won Song of the Year at both the CMA and ACM Awards. The record earned raves from NPR to Country Weekly and found the New York Times hailing him as \"a sensitive macho man,\" a compliment that perfectly encapsulates both sides of Brice's persona. Hard 2 Love also garnered Lee his late-night debut, a stirring performance of \"I Drive Your Truck\" on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d\n\n\"On my first record, I had all these ideas and sounds I didn't know how to get out of me,\" Brice remembers, crediting frequent collaborator Doug Johnson with helping him learn some of the early ropes of recording. \"On Hard 2 Love, I figured out that I could really step out and try things in the studio, and if they don't work they don't work, but sometimes those ideas become the basis of how you record some tracks.\u201d\n\nBrice took it a step further on I Don't Dance, relishing the role of producer with a flair for experimentation as yet another way to mold and shape his songs to match the sounds he'd been chasing in his head.\n\n\"I wanted to have control over every drumbeat, every lick of the bass part,\" he explains of his meticulous approach in the studio. \"It was a lot of really sitting down and thinking about every little piece that goes into it.\"\n\nRather than approach the record as a whole entity, Brice listened to what each song called for and played to its strengths, allowing the warmth and presence of his personality to form the cohesive thread that binds them all together. On the lighthearted summer anthem \u201cGirls In Bikinis,\u201d he built the track entirely from the ground up, playing every single instrument himself. The searing \u201cSirens,\u201d on the other hand, was cut live and loud in the studio, with raw electric guitars and a banjo part that captured Brice's first time playing the instrument. Other tracks grew out of drum loops and studio experiments, inspired in part by his love of recent albums from Bruno Mars and Eminem. Live-show- moment \u201cDrinking Class,\u201d one of three songs on the album not written by Brice, taught him a valuable lesson about hearing what the music calls for. \"We had ideas to put a lot of electronic sounds in it,\" he explains, \"but after we cut it, I had a feeling that this is really a song about the working class, and it needed those sounds, like chain gang stomps and claps and hums, and now I have a sledgehammer hitting a railroad tie on there. I changed everything about it to get it back to its roots. Sometimes you gotta go to a lot of the wrong places to get to the right places, and that's not wasted time. It takes that trip to get to where you're going.\"\n\n\"Panama City\" is another track that took a circuitous journey to its final destination on the new album. Written by his good friend Chris Thompkins, the track first caught Brice's ear a decade ago when he heard a stripped-down arrangement of it on one of Thompkins' work tapes.\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t imagine it being any different than what I heard on the work tape,\" says Brice. \"I said we had to do it live because I didn't want to give myself the option of redoing vocals or piano or bringing in background singers later. They brought the piano out into the main room of Ocean Way Studios [in Nashville], which is an old church, and we took our headphones off, had no click tracks, no drums. It's like they did 50 years ago. We played it four times and the last time was perfect. I took it off the board exactly the way we recorded it and mastered it, and it's my favorite track on the record by far.\u201d Perhaps the most personal song on the album, though, is the title track, which Brice wrote for the first dance at his May 2013 wedding. As with so much of his work, the lyrics are inspired by his undying love for his wife, Sara, but they resonate with a huge audience. Top wedding website The Knot recently selected it for the \"Dream Wedding\" they threw for a pair of Boston Marathon bombing survivors.\n\n\"It's my favorite song I've ever written in my life,\" says Lee, \"and I don\u2019t know that that'll ever change.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/CircleAllAccess/posts/232606148164824"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Paul Potts ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616822.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Recording a live operatic song each day"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Two Blue Roses House Concert Series ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10131290.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "House Concert Series in Eugene Oregon for local and touring quality acoustic Independent musicians hosted by Jeanette Lundgren", "otherInfo": "Two Blue Roses (in Eugene, Oregon) Presents From Different Mothers (Jeff Kossack and Jimmy Yessian) on Saturday, May 16th.\n4:30 till 6 PM PDT\nOn Facebook Live, both on this page: https://www.facebook.com/TwoBlueRosesEugene"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Machine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9063116.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Pink Floyd", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "THE MACHINE, America\u2019s top Pink Floyd show, has forged a 30 year reputation of excellence, extending the legacy of Pink Floyd, while creating another legacy all their own.

By that point, Leigh was well rooted in Austin, where she moved after growing up playing in a family band in Minnesota. \u201cI was attracted to the scene in Austin,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to learn and get better at what I do.\u201d Meanwhile, McKay fronted the regionally popular McKay Brothers (Cold Beer and Hot Tamales), a band legendary songwriter Guy Clark had been championing for years. \u201cNoel and Brennen are great songwriters,\u201d says Clark, whose new album My Favorite Picture of You contains the McKay co-write \u201cEl Coyote.\u201d \u201cAnd Brennen plays guitar like a motherfucker.\u201d Before the World Was Made proves his point. \u201cSome of these are songs that Noel had from a long time ago that we reconstructed,\u201d Leigh says, \u201cand some we wrote together recently. Writing duets is just almost like writing from one point of view and splitting it and making it make sense. Like \u2018Ball in Chain,\u2019 is not like a fight song. Same with \u2018Breaking Up and Making Up Again.\u2019 They\u2019re dysfunctional, but the characters are happy with their situation, so it\u2019s almost from one point of view.\u201d The singular duo effortlessly balances wit (\u201cLet\u2019s Don\u2019t Get Married\u201d) and whimsy (\u201cLet\u2019s Go to Lubbock on Vacation\u201d) throughout. \u201cI\u2019ve loaded up the Nomad and the tank is full of gas/We\u2019ll ride along across the High Plains fast,\u201d the latter goes. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the sweetest spot on God\u2019s creation, my pretty little turtle dove/Let\u2019s go to Lubbock on vacation.\u201d Punch line: \u201cThen we\u2019ll know we\u2019re really in love.\u201d The pair consistently doubles down with sharp snapshots charting equally unpredictable romantic byways (\u201cSalty Kisses in the Sand,\u201d \u201cGreat Big Oldsmobile\u201d). \u201cWe kind of set out to make out a record of songs that we were singing together, even if it wasn\u2019t specifically duet songs,\u201d McKay says. \u201cWe both have solo careers to think about, but we\u2019ll probably revisit this over and over and it\u2019s a nice thing we can keep doing.\u201d \u201cWe got to where people were asking us about certain songs and lumping us together in their mind,\u201d Leigh adds, \u201cso we thought we should make something to pay homage to that. Of course, people like the funny ones the best.\u201d Good reason: Only kindred spirits allow a song as wickedly waggish as \u201cBe My Ball and Chain.\u201d Priceless. Everyday conversation suggests Leigh and McKay indeed share a single mindset. The pair simply compliment each other in every way. \u201cBrennen\u2019s really great at melodies,\u201d McKay says. \u201cShe\u2019s always kicking around a melody around the house and it\u2019s great and she\u2019ll attach it to a lyric idea that\u2019s equally great. She writes characters in her songs like a novelist.\u201d \u201cNoel always has the line,\u201d Leigh counters. \u201cIt\u2019s like, How are we gonna wrap this up? How are we gonna bring it around so it makes sense? He always ties it up. He always knows.

Rhythm underlines each ebb and flow, scoring the soundtrack to humanity\u2019s evolution.\n\nWith every move, Black Eyed Peas dictate the rhythm of culture. Blurring genre lines long before it became commonplace and pioneering an unprecedented global hybrid of hip-hop, pop, electro, and world as early as 1995, the Los Angeles trio\u2014will.i.am, apl.de.ap, and Taboo\u2014maximize the momentum of a legendary career earmarked by making history, breaking records, and raising the bar yet again in 2020 and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe last time we were this clear was in 1995 when we started the group,\u201d grins will.i.am. \u201cThere was a lane for us. There was room for us. We capitalized on moments to make an impact in 2003 and 2009. We\u2019re looking to the future now. What\u2019s the next ten years? For us, they\u2019re about being purposeful in society.\u201d\n\nThe group certainly constructed the perfect launchpad to be \u201cpurposeful.\u201d Over the past 25 years, they earned six GRAMMY\u00ae Awards and achieved sales of 35 million albums and 120 million singles across seminal releases such as Elephunk, The E.N.D., and more. Cemented as one of the era\u2019s biggest acts, they emerged as \u201cthe second best-selling artist/group of all-time for downloaded tracks,\u201d according to Nielsen, and landed on Billboard\u2019s \u201cHot 100 Artists of the Decade.\u201d Moving over 3 million tickets, performing 300-plus shows throughout 30 different countries, and headlining stadiums, they graced the biggest stage in the world with a landmark performance at the Super Bowl XLV Halftime Show in 2011.\n\nAfter reaching these heights, a period of relative quiet followed\u2014lasting nearly eight years. As always, Black Eyed Peas\u2019 music coursed through the zeitgeist between one-off singles, but the group simultaneously endured life\u2019s trials and tribulations. Taboo battled cancer in 2014, recovering victoriously with his brothers by his side at home.\n\n\u201cMetaphorically, Black Eyed Peas gave me life, but also in a real sense,\u201d admits Taboo. \u201cI had that horrible disease. At least, I was back in Los Angeles to deal with it. I became stronger and got back into work mode with my brothers. I appreciate us having another chance to feed this amazing journey and vehicle of Black Eyed Peas. This is my engine. It kept me fighting to know I\u2019d be on stage again. It taught me how to appreciate and love every moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have a run like we did, you should not expect for it to repeat,\u201d adds will.i.am. \u201cWe never thought we could do what we did in the first place. Then, we basically took an eight-year break. It\u2019s taken a long time for us to get back. We had to learn, and to refocus on our roots. We\u2019re a trio again, swinging for the fences. It\u2019s a new era here.\u201d\n\nThey found the best way to ignite this era on the single \u201cRITMO (Bad Boys For Life)\u201d alongside one of the hottest acts in the world and possibly the biggest Latin star of the millennium J Balvin. Featured as the lead single of the Bad Boys For Life Soundtrack, it exploded as a phenomenon right out of the gate, generating over 180 million streams and 294 million video views in under a month\u2019s time. Creatively, it illustrated yet another breakthrough. Once again, Black Eyed Peas pulled from the streets, magnifying underground club energy, reggaeton grooves, and a Spanglish singalong on a global sonic canvas.\n\n\u201c\u2018RITMO\u2019 is about having a good time,\u201d Taboo states. \u201cAs much as we live in an internet age, people like to go out. So, this song is all going out, expressing yourself, and living life to the fullest. It\u2019s a party song. I want my whole week to be like my Friday and Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always joke, \u2018Damn, we made a career out of going out\u2019,\u201d laughs apl.de.ap. \u201cWe still go out all the time. We just call it \u2018research\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe deliberately aimed to make a record that reflected our origins and celebrated the last two decades,\u201d will.i.am elaborates. \u201cWe love boom-bap. We love hip-hop. We love Latin. When we made The E.N.D., I was going to a lot of clubs and hearing what was happening with dance music. The same thing is going on now with Latin. There\u2019s a Latin Afro-fusion influence to this next chapter. It\u2019s always been there, and it\u2019s part of our DNA as an L.A. group. We\u2019ve been working on songs that are muscle with a global punch and saved them because we knew they would be special. This is one of them.\u201d\n\nWith their eighth album and full-length debut for Epic Records on the way, Black Eyed Peas fulfill a perennial purpose on new music and so much more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a family,\u201d concludes apl.de.ap. \u201cWe have bigger dreams than ever, and we\u2019re going to make them happen together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot from our journey,\u201d will.i.am leaves off. \u201cI think we\u2019ve learned more than we thought possible. I believe our younger selves would be proud of the courageous and fearless people we\u2019ve become, because there\u2019s a deeper meaning in our music. We try to bring answers and joy.

When pressed for musical comparisons to her musical ability, the Oakville, Ontario-born Rayy is reluctant to provide. For as long as she\u2019s been playing music, she has been herself. Comparisons are easy to fall back on, but for Nicole, her music should always speak for itself.\n\nNicole Rayy first blasted into the Canadian Country music scene in 2012 with the release of her debut EP \u201cOnly Everything\u201d. She went on to release her debut full-length album Dig, in October 2016. The highly anticipated album, continued in the theme of uncompromising honesty and challenges listeners, as well as Nicole herself, to dig deep down to the emotional core of themselves. Produced at Noble Street Studios in Toronto by renowned Record Producer/Writer and Musical Director Doug Romanow, whose long list of clients include Justin Bieber, Johnny Reid, Chantal Kreviazuk, and the Canadian Country Music Awards. The album showcases Rayy\u2019s tonal range and relatable sentiment perfectly\n\nThe release of the album was celebrated by a performance and fundraising event at Cowboys Roadhouse in Winnipeg, MB, which raised over $4000 for the Manitoba Neurofibromatosis Support Group (MBNF). It was shortly after the event, that the title single \u201cDig,\u201d also released in October 2016, started to make its way on to radio stations across Canada. The single was highly supported nationally and garnered over 63,000 streams on Spotify.\n\nWith the success of the album and single \u201cDig,\u201d Nicole released her next single \u201cFireproof\u201d March, 2017, and embarked on a radio tour throughout Ontario and across Western Canada. \u201cFireproof,\u201d hit immediate success among music programmers and directors, and to date has received over 155,000 streams on Spotify.\n\nThe single took Nicole into what became a very exciting 2017, seeing her invited back to perform at such festivals as Manitoulin Countryfest, The Calgary Stampede and Burlington Ribfest, sharing the stage with artists such as The Chris Buck Band, Crystal Shawanda, and Joe Nichols. Nicole was also invited to showcase at the Country Music Association of Ontario Roadshow in Ottawa, NSAI Toronto\u2019s Tin Pan North, Diamonds In The Rough during Canadian Country Music Week in Saskatchewan, SK, and Indie Week Canada in Toronto, November 2017.\n\nNicole has also had the honour of performing at the World Music Festival in Shanghai, China, for three years in a row (2015-2017), and will be returning again in 2018, proving to be a hit among Shanghai\u2019s enthusiastic crowds.\n\n2018 began with an opportunity to open for Brett Kissel in Barrie, Ontario, and continued with multiple festival performances including Dauphin Countryfest, Trackside in London and the main stage at the Howl at the Moon festival in Manitoba opening for Aaron Pritchett and Brett Kissel\n\nIn June Nicole was honoured to be nominated for Rising Star by the CMA Ontario and her latest single \u201cBad Habit\u201d was released and has been very popular with her fans this summer.\n\nWith a sound that is distinctly her own and a creative ambition that knows no bounds, Nicole Rayy feels right at home either on a stage or in a recording studio and will never stay put in one place for too long.

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joey McGee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9009605.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Folk, Bluegrass, Roots Rock, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-songwriter Joey McGee makes music infused with the energy of his native New Orleans, informed by his experiences working and living in Pittsburgh and inspired by the Brazos Valley vistas of his current home in Bryan, Texas.

Either way, allow us to present the real story from the horse\u2019s (man\u2019s) mouth\u2026\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: (No animals were harmed in the making of this bio.)\n\nThroughout over three decades in music, Steve Poltz did it all and more\u2014often shared by way of his rockin\u2019 countrified folk slices of sardonic Americana (hatched in Halifax). Of course, he co-wrote Jewel\u2019s multiplatinum Hot 100-topping megahit \u201cYou Were Meant For Me,\u201d but he also went on a whale watch with her and a few federales that turned into a drug bust. The two still share the story at every festival they play together. He made his bones as the frontman for underground legends The Rugburns, who burned rubber crisscrossing the continent on marathon tours and still pop up once in a while for the rare and quickly sold out reunion gig.\n\nIn 20 years since his full-length solo debut, One Left Shoe, he blessed the world\u2019s ears with twelve solo records, spanning the acclaimed 2010 Dreamhouse and most recently Folk Singer in 2015. NPR summed it up best, \u201cCritics and fans alike now regard Poltz as a talented and prolific songwriter.\u201d By 2016, he survived a stroke, endured anything the music industry could throw at him, and still performed like \u201c280 days a year.\u201d\n\nHowever, he still never lived in Nashville, which represents a turning point in the story and the genesis of his 2018 Red House Records debut, Shine On\u2026\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend Sharon sold the condo we were living in, and I was ready to live in a van, which seemed like a good idea for one night\u2014then I decided I wanted a kitchen and a closet,\u201d he admits. \u201cSharon wanted to move to Nashville, because she thought it would be good for me. It caused a huge fight. I\u2019d been in San Diego since 1980, and that\u2019s where I cut my musical teeth. I thought I\u2019d never leave. In fact, at the height of our fight, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving San Diego. I am San Diego!\u2019 This makes me laugh now. As soon as I got to Nashville, I immediately knew I wanted to make a record in \u2018Music City\u2019.\u201d\nSo, the man who once protested \u201cI am San Diego\u201d made Shine On in his new home of Nashville with one of its elder statesman behind the board, Will Kimbrough [Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell]. Holing up in the studio at Kimbrough\u2019s house, nothing would be off limits. Together, they unlocked the kind of creative chemistry you only hear about in band bios\u2014but for real.\n\n\u201cI respect Will so much, and I\u2019d always wanted to work with him,\u201d says Steve. \u201cLike two mad scientists, we just took our time and had fun. We didn\u2019t overthink things. Everything felt organic. We ate soul food and drank lots of really good coffee. We tried out weird sounds, and the songs always started with voice and guitar\u2014no click track, just how I\u2019d play them. I road tested many of them, and they were ripe for the picking when recording time came around.\u201d\n\nEvoking themes of \u201chope, love, contemplation, celebration of Wednesday, pharmacists, and the fact that windows are not inanimate objects and they sometimes have conversations with each other,\u201d the record represents Steve at his most inspired and insightful. The opener and title track \u201cShine On\u201d pairs a delicate vocal with lithely plucked acoustic strings as he urges, \u201cShine on, shine on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song was a gift,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI woke up really early in Encinitas, California at Sharon\u2019s sister\u2019s house. The sun was just coming up. I was all alone in perfect solitude. My guitar was there. The sky was gorgeous. I wrote it as a poem. Everyone always told me, \u2018Never start a record with a really slow song.\u2019 So, seeing that I have O.D.D. (Oppositional Defiance Disorder), I started my record with one. I love the mood it sets. It\u2019s almost like my mission statement, trying to find some semblance of positivity and light in a sometimes ruthless world.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cPharmacist,\u201d rustling guitar and harmonica propel a tale of \u201cthis dude having a crush on his pharmacist.\u201d It also serves as an extension of his friendship with neighbor Scot Sax\u2014with whom he shares the podcast \u201cOne Hit Neighbors\u201d (since they\u2019ve both had one hit song). Meanwhile, he joined forces with Molly Tuttle on \u201c4th of July,\u201d which, of course, came to life on the 3rd of July. \u201cBallin On Wednesday\u201d drew its title and chorus from a diner checkout girl (with a super cool gold tooth) who Steve paid with a $100 bill and she replied, \u201cOooh, ballin\u2019 on a Wednsday.\u201d The finale \u201cAll Things Shine\u201d skips along on sparse instrumentation as Steve sends a message.\n\n\u201c\u2018All Things Shine\u2019 came about after one of the many mass shootings on this planet,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI was feeling overwhelmed. So, I wanted to put my feelings into words and melody. I was thinking that even if we\u2019re feeling hopeless that there is still beauty. All things shine in their own way.\u201d\nWho could contend that?\n\nIn the end, for everything you can call him \u201csearcher, smartass, movie freak, lover of technology, news junkie, baseball fan to nth degree, lapsed catholic who still believes in god even though all his friends are atheists and think he\u2019s an idiot, and maker of fun,\u201d you might just call Steve that little light in the dark we all need in this day and age.\n\nOr Nashville\u2019s Canadian Jiminy Cricket\u2026\n\n\u201cI hope Shine On makes listeners smile and feel welcome, and they want to share it with their friends,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic means energy to me.

During a period when he headlined his first Massey Hall concert and supported sold out shows with The Gaslight Anthem all over North America, Matt teamed up with co-producer Eric Ratz to record at studios around Toronto between touring commitments.\n\nTwice Upon a Hell of a Time\u2026 was originally conceived as a straight-up solo interpretation, similar to the iTunes Session recorded with Ratz in 2011. As the songs took shape, however, Matt decided to incorporate extra vocals and instrumentation. Tapping musicians Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Lee Harvey Osmond) on pedal steel, Anthony Carone (Arkells) on piano, and guest singers Andrew Rodriguez, Kate Dyke, and Melissa Payne, the album\u2019s arrangements are lush and large without straying from the \u2018unplugged\u2019 vibe he sought from the outset.\n\nLead track \u201cOla Volo\u201d is inspired by a Vancouver-based mural artist of the same name who also created the original album art for both records. \u201cHer paintings and drawings all have a theme that I picked up on,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature. To me, it\u2019s from another dimension, a very curious dimension that draws me in. Her pieces are very edgy and real-life at the same time. I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance).

Two Super-Bowl appearances, Pollstar Box Office chart-topping tours with Def Leppard, Journey, Boston, REO Speedwagon, Bad Company (to name only a few), two more studio albums and no end in sight, STYX continues to conquer the planet, one venue at a time.\n\nSpawned from a suburban Chicago basement in the early \u201870s, Styx would eventually transform into the virtual arena rock prototype by the late '70s and early '80s, due to a fondness for big rockers and soaring power ballads.\n\nEarly on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake & Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as non-stop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until a track originally from their second album, \"Lady\" started to get substantial airplay in late '74 on the Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with their record label, and opted to sign on with A&M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (their former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, original guitarist John Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw. Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as \"Come Sail Away,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Blue Collar Man\" and \"Fooling Yourself.\u201d\n\nThe band decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once-beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as \"Too Much Time on My Hands\". It also marked the first time in history that a band released four consecutive triple-platinum albums.\n\nA career-encompassing live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of its members pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade. A re-recording of their early hit, \"Lady\" (titled \"Lady\" '95\"), for a Greatest Hits compilation, finally united Shaw with his former Styx bandmates, which led to a full-on reunion tour in 1996. But drummer John Panozzo fell seriously ill at the time (due to a long struggle with alcoholism), which prevented him from joining the proceedings -- as he passed away in July of the same year. Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's \"Return to Paradise,\" while a whole new generation of rock fans were introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track \"Mr. Roboto,\" as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks & Geeks.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpu0LMJ0ygg"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Michael Salgado ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9714054.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jorma Kaukonen ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617604.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jorma Ludwik Kaukonen Jr. (born December 23, 1940 in Washington, D.C.) is an American blues, folk and rock guitarist.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn to a Finnish American father and a Jewish American mother, employed by the U.S. foreign service, Kaukonen was a founding member of the popular psychedelic San Francisco-based band Jefferson Airplane, which scored two Top 10 radio hits in 1967 with \"Somebody to Love\" and \"White Rabbit.\"\n\nKaukonen learned to play guitar as a teenager in Washington, D.C. But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joey McGee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9009605.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Folk, Bluegrass, Roots Rock, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-songwriter Joey McGee makes music infused with the energy of his native New Orleans, informed by his experiences working and living in Pittsburgh and inspired by the Brazos Valley vistas of his current home in Bryan, Texas.

Either way, allow us to present the real story from the horse\u2019s (man\u2019s) mouth\u2026\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: (No animals were harmed in the making of this bio.)\n\nThroughout over three decades in music, Steve Poltz did it all and more\u2014often shared by way of his rockin\u2019 countrified folk slices of sardonic Americana (hatched in Halifax). Of course, he co-wrote Jewel\u2019s multiplatinum Hot 100-topping megahit \u201cYou Were Meant For Me,\u201d but he also went on a whale watch with her and a few federales that turned into a drug bust. The two still share the story at every festival they play together. He made his bones as the frontman for underground legends The Rugburns, who burned rubber crisscrossing the continent on marathon tours and still pop up once in a while for the rare and quickly sold out reunion gig.\n\nIn 20 years since his full-length solo debut, One Left Shoe, he blessed the world\u2019s ears with twelve solo records, spanning the acclaimed 2010 Dreamhouse and most recently Folk Singer in 2015. NPR summed it up best, \u201cCritics and fans alike now regard Poltz as a talented and prolific songwriter.\u201d By 2016, he survived a stroke, endured anything the music industry could throw at him, and still performed like \u201c280 days a year.\u201d\n\nHowever, he still never lived in Nashville, which represents a turning point in the story and the genesis of his 2018 Red House Records debut, Shine On\u2026\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend Sharon sold the condo we were living in, and I was ready to live in a van, which seemed like a good idea for one night\u2014then I decided I wanted a kitchen and a closet,\u201d he admits. \u201cSharon wanted to move to Nashville, because she thought it would be good for me. It caused a huge fight. I\u2019d been in San Diego since 1980, and that\u2019s where I cut my musical teeth. I thought I\u2019d never leave. In fact, at the height of our fight, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving San Diego. I am San Diego!\u2019 This makes me laugh now. As soon as I got to Nashville, I immediately knew I wanted to make a record in \u2018Music City\u2019.\u201d\nSo, the man who once protested \u201cI am San Diego\u201d made Shine On in his new home of Nashville with one of its elder statesman behind the board, Will Kimbrough [Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell]. Holing up in the studio at Kimbrough\u2019s house, nothing would be off limits. Together, they unlocked the kind of creative chemistry you only hear about in band bios\u2014but for real.\n\n\u201cI respect Will so much, and I\u2019d always wanted to work with him,\u201d says Steve. \u201cLike two mad scientists, we just took our time and had fun. We didn\u2019t overthink things. Everything felt organic. We ate soul food and drank lots of really good coffee. We tried out weird sounds, and the songs always started with voice and guitar\u2014no click track, just how I\u2019d play them. I road tested many of them, and they were ripe for the picking when recording time came around.\u201d\n\nEvoking themes of \u201chope, love, contemplation, celebration of Wednesday, pharmacists, and the fact that windows are not inanimate objects and they sometimes have conversations with each other,\u201d the record represents Steve at his most inspired and insightful. The opener and title track \u201cShine On\u201d pairs a delicate vocal with lithely plucked acoustic strings as he urges, \u201cShine on, shine on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song was a gift,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI woke up really early in Encinitas, California at Sharon\u2019s sister\u2019s house. The sun was just coming up. I was all alone in perfect solitude. My guitar was there. The sky was gorgeous. I wrote it as a poem. Everyone always told me, \u2018Never start a record with a really slow song.\u2019 So, seeing that I have O.D.D. (Oppositional Defiance Disorder), I started my record with one. I love the mood it sets. It\u2019s almost like my mission statement, trying to find some semblance of positivity and light in a sometimes ruthless world.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cPharmacist,\u201d rustling guitar and harmonica propel a tale of \u201cthis dude having a crush on his pharmacist.\u201d It also serves as an extension of his friendship with neighbor Scot Sax\u2014with whom he shares the podcast \u201cOne Hit Neighbors\u201d (since they\u2019ve both had one hit song). Meanwhile, he joined forces with Molly Tuttle on \u201c4th of July,\u201d which, of course, came to life on the 3rd of July. \u201cBallin On Wednesday\u201d drew its title and chorus from a diner checkout girl (with a super cool gold tooth) who Steve paid with a $100 bill and she replied, \u201cOooh, ballin\u2019 on a Wednsday.\u201d The finale \u201cAll Things Shine\u201d skips along on sparse instrumentation as Steve sends a message.\n\n\u201c\u2018All Things Shine\u2019 came about after one of the many mass shootings on this planet,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI was feeling overwhelmed. So, I wanted to put my feelings into words and melody. I was thinking that even if we\u2019re feeling hopeless that there is still beauty. All things shine in their own way.\u201d\nWho could contend that?\n\nIn the end, for everything you can call him \u201csearcher, smartass, movie freak, lover of technology, news junkie, baseball fan to nth degree, lapsed catholic who still believes in god even though all his friends are atheists and think he\u2019s an idiot, and maker of fun,\u201d you might just call Steve that little light in the dark we all need in this day and age.\n\nOr Nashville\u2019s Canadian Jiminy Cricket\u2026\n\n\u201cI hope Shine On makes listeners smile and feel welcome, and they want to share it with their friends,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic means energy to me.

While Nick was working on his solo project, Joe followed in his footsteps to Broadway, appearing in Baz Lurhmann's production of La Boheme.\n\nBy September 2004, an executive at Columbia Records found out about Nick's song. Nick was soon jointly signed to INO Records and Columbia Records and released the single \"Dear God\". A second single, a new solo recording of \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\", was released on November 16. It was supposed to be followed by a December release of a self-titled solo album Nicholas Jonas, but the album had been pushed back; it did, however, get a limited release. Nick, along with Kevin and Joe, had written several other songs for the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. After meeting with Nick and hearing the song, \"Please Be Mine,\" written and performed by the brothers, Daylight Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act.\n\nAfter being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers.\"\n\nThroughout 2005, the Jonas Brothers went on several tours, including being the opening act of Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five.They spent the latter portion of the year on an anti-drug tour with Aly & AJ and The Cheetah Girls. Additionally, they opened for The Veronicas in early 2006.\n\nFor the album, titled It's About Time, the band collaborated with several writers, including Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne), Michael Mangini (Joss Stone), Desmond Child (Aerosmith, Bon Jovi), Billy Mann (Destiny's Child, Jessica Simpson) and Steve Greenberg (Joss Stone, Hanson). The album was initially supposed to be released in February 2006, but was pushed back several times.The delay was due to executive changes at Sony (the parent company of Columbia) and the executives' desire to have \"another lead single\" on the album. For the album, the Jonas Brothers covered two hit songs by UK band Busted - \"Year 3000\" and \"What I Go to School For\".\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' first single, \"Mandy\", was released on December 27, 2005. Its music video was shown on MTV's Total Request Live on February 22, 2006 and reached number four. Another song, \"Time for Me to Fly,\" was released on the Aquamarine soundtrack, also in February. In March, \"Mandy\" was featured in the Nickelodeon television film Zoey 101: Spring Break-Up and the Zoey 101: Music Mix soundtrack album, with Nicholas Jonas listed as the artist name. The group's music was also featured on Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoon Fridays.The band covered \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" from Pirates of the Caribbean for the DisneyMania 4 album, released on April 4, 2006. Over the summer of 2006, the Jonas Brothers went on tour with Aly & AJ. The Jonas Brothers also created the theme song for the second season of American Dragon Jake Long, airing from June 2006 to September 2007 on the Disney Channel.\n\nIt's About Time was finally released on August 8, 2006. According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of 50,000 copies, so the album can be bid on auction sites like eBay for up to $200-$300 USD. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels.\n\nOn October 3, 2006, Nick's 2004 solo single, \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer),\" was re-released on Joy to the World: The Ultimate Christmas Collection. Also in October, the Jonas Brothers covered \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid. Along with a music video, the song was released on a two-disk special-edition release of The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The second single from It's About Time was \"Year 3000.\" The song became popular on Radio Disney, and the music video debuted on Disney Channel in January 2007.\n\nThe band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.\n\nAfter shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007. Around the same time, brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle. On March 24, two additional songs on two different albums were released: \"Kids of the Future\" from the Meet the Robinsons soundtrack (Based on Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\"), and \"I Wanna Be like You\" from DisneyMania 5.\n\nTheir self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007. It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week. Two singles with music videos were also released around this time - \"Hold On\" two weeks before, and \"S.O.S.\" just after the release of the album.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008 with CDVU+ technology, just like their last album, Jonas Brothers. On June 24, 2008, iTunes announced that it would be releasing four songs from A Little Bit Longer, one roughly every two weeks. The purchase of each of the songs will go toward the price of the entire album, and one will be able to buy it using the Complete the Album feature after the album is released. Each song will also feature a new podcast episode from the boys. The schedule: June 24, 2008 for \"Burnin' Up\"; July 15, 2008 for \"Pushin' Me Away\"; July 29, 2008 for \"Tonight\"; and August 5, 2008 for \"A Little Bit Longer.\" Now that all of the singles have been released, all of them have occupied the number 1 spot on iTunes for at least 3 days.\n\nThe band filmed a Disney Channel Original Movie called Camp Rock where they play a band called \"Connect Three.\" Joe plays the lead male role and lead singer \"Shane Gray\"; Nick plays the role of \"Nate,\" a guitarist; and Kevin plays the role of \"Jason,\" also a guitarist. A soundtrack for the movie was released on June 17, 2008. It debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 with 188,000 copies sold in its first week.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers made history being the first group ever to sell more than 100,000 digital downloads for three consecutive singles: \"Burnin' Up\", 183,000+ first week sales, \"Play My Music\", 109,000+ sales, and \"Pushin' Me Away\", 116,000+ sales. In addition, \"Burnin' Up\", \"Pushin' Me Away\", and \"Tonight\" all charted as #1 on the iTunes \"Top Songs\" Chart for several days, pushing off Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\", which had been charting for weeks on #1 already.", "otherInfo": "Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dead Reckoning ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10372017.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Metal", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dead Reckoning\u2122 is an unstoppable metal band from Fort Benning GA. We have created much of our own sound by taking bits and pieces of every genre we love and smashed it together to make what is our sound today! We have been told we sound like a mash up of Lamb of God, Slayer ,Black Label Society, Slipknot and now even some Killswitch! Taking the heavier edge, we love and bringing back the mind numbing solos from the past. Nothing beats thunderous drums, heavy vocals, killer bass riffs and a screaming lead guitar!!! Time to get rid of the cookie cutter bands and music and get back to our roots kicking ass! We pride ourselves in being able to please every fan no matter what genre you are into we have something for you!!! So sit back relax and prepare for you mind to be melted!\n\nDead Reckoning\u2122 was formed by Mike K-OS Spriggs originally from Albuquerque NM, at the time an active duty soldier stationed at Fort Benning GA in the spring of 2012 with the goal to mix old and new metal elements to create something powerful, lasting and unique. He began to build a foundation from bands like Slayer, Lamb Of God, Children of Bodom, BLS, Pantera and many others to create what has become the Dead Reckoning\u2122 Sound. Ryan Lake has taken over on Drums to bring true clarity and power to the rhythm section with fast pummeling rolls and dynamic foot work. On Bass, Brian Silverstein is now holding down the low end with a bass finger style reminiscent of Iron Maiden and early Metallica with his killer sound. New vocalist Curt Esparza was once the bassist for us and found himself down a different path but once he heard we were looking for a new singer he quickly made his way back. Within days of tryouts he was signed to the band with a very unique sounding range of screams, growls and even cleans bringing us to a new level for upcoming albums. Dead Reckoning\u2122 now stands ready to make their charge down the path of world domination, now as a national touring band looking to reset the world's mind on metal and get back to our ass kicking roots.

Two Super-Bowl appearances, Pollstar Box Office chart-topping tours with Def Leppard, Journey, Boston, REO Speedwagon, Bad Company (to name only a few), two more studio albums and no end in sight, STYX continues to conquer the planet, one venue at a time.\n\nSpawned from a suburban Chicago basement in the early \u201870s, Styx would eventually transform into the virtual arena rock prototype by the late '70s and early '80s, due to a fondness for big rockers and soaring power ballads.\n\nEarly on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake & Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as non-stop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until a track originally from their second album, \"Lady\" started to get substantial airplay in late '74 on the Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with their record label, and opted to sign on with A&M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (their former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, original guitarist John Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw. Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as \"Come Sail Away,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Blue Collar Man\" and \"Fooling Yourself.\u201d\n\nThe band decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once-beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as \"Too Much Time on My Hands\". It also marked the first time in history that a band released four consecutive triple-platinum albums.\n\nA career-encompassing live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of its members pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade. A re-recording of their early hit, \"Lady\" (titled \"Lady\" '95\"), for a Greatest Hits compilation, finally united Shaw with his former Styx bandmates, which led to a full-on reunion tour in 1996. But drummer John Panozzo fell seriously ill at the time (due to a long struggle with alcoholism), which prevented him from joining the proceedings -- as he passed away in July of the same year. Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's \"Return to Paradise,\" while a whole new generation of rock fans were introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track \"Mr. Roboto,\" as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks & Geeks.", "otherInfo": "Join us Saturday night at 8pm EST/5pm PST for STYX FIX LIVE SATURDAY on our official Youtube."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kim Prevost and Bill Solley Fan Page ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10378908.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Jazz Soul", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Kim Prevost and guitarist Bill Solley has been racing the high road to success since winning the 1999 \"BET on Jazz\" Jazz Discovery Award.
