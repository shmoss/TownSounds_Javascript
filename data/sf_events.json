Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013. He's lent his vocal expertise to many local releases, and appears on MUSHROOMHEAD\u2019s album, \u201cBeautiful Stories For Ugly Children\u201d, singing on the track \u201cHoles In The Void\u201d\n\nAnd not to be outdone Joe has released three cd\u2019s of original material, \u201cJUST JOE SOLO EP\u201d (December 2011), \u201cMy Demons, My Burden, My Life\u201d (May of 2012) and \u201cGot Joe?\u201d (December of 2012). And now after a very successful Kickstarter campaign, Joe\u2019s next album, \u201cSo The Story Goes\u2026\u201d will be released this Spring 2013!!\n\nUpstate New York born and bred.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute. It\u2019s great to have Under\u00f8ath back\u2014especially on their terms.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "C-kan LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9713797.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Daniel Park LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10146427.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Indie, Pop Punk, Rock, Alternative, Classical, Folk, Songwriter, Singer, Acoustic, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When Daniel Park\u2019s parents insisted on private violin lessons for him at age seven, he might have anticipated the success he achieved playing in his middle and high school orchestras. But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Catherine Cohen LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ed Helms LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Whiskey Sour Happy Hour Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Bluegrass Situation LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Whiskey Sour Happy Hour Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pearla LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thesultanroom"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mikayla Lane LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9300893.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Mikayla Lane is a singer/songwriter in the Tulsa, Ok area.

Maybe it comes through in how she learned to read by pouring through lyric sheets and liner notes, or how she starting singing by belting along to U2 and Shania Twain in the back of her parents\u2019 car. Or maybe it will come to light in the thousands she\u2019s raised and the miles she\u2019s logged supporting the charitable initiatives she created while still a teenager. Or maybe it will simply come across in her stunning voice and wise, insightful lyricism, all infinitely beguiling for someone of her young age. But that\u2019s the thing about Townes. She\u2019s never operated by the clock or the calendar. She operates from her heart, and from her soul.\n\nThe Canadian-born Townes, isn\u2019t quite like anyone else who has graced the city\u2019s stages. With the lyrical fortitude of Griffin or Lori McKenna, the soulful nature of Chris Stapleton or even Adele, Townes is paving ground all her own. Working on her debut LP with Jay Joyce, the Nashville-based Townes started her journey to becoming one of country\u2019s most promising new artists back in rural Canada, in the backseat of a car. \u201cI would obsess in the back seat over lyrics,\u201d says Townes, who recalls drives in her home of Grande Prairie, a small town in Alberta, Canada, with her parents. \u201cI would follow along to all of the words and sing along, and call out my favorites. Eventually, I started to learn all of the writer and producer names, just soaking it all up.\u201d\n\nTownes insisted that her parents \u2013 supportive, hard-working local entrepreneurs \u2013 sign her up for singing lessons at the age of five, which led to owning her first guitar from her grandparents at fourteen. It was perfect timing, as Townes had already started to explore what it would be like to set her poetry to music. While other kids were reading Shakespeare and studying, Townes added the craft of famed songwriters like Carolyn Dawn Johnson to her workload, developing her own narrative style before most other teenagers even headed to prom. \u201cThere were a lot of things to write about at fourteen,\u201d Townes says. \u201cI\u2019ve always craved what it felt like to step into other people\u2019s shoes. And if songwriting was a way to step into character and make someone feel less alone, then I was all in.\u201d It\u2019s telling that Townes\u2019 first song came from a conversation in social studies class \u2013 she thought about it on the entire bus ride home and hurried to her bedroom to put her feeling to words.\n\nEver since then, so many of her lyrics have come from that place of empathy and observance \u2013 a few years later, moments she\u2019s seen in passing or discussed at the dinner table with her family or wept about alongside strangers have worked their way into her sonic perspectives. Soon, she was traveling to Nashville regularly to exercise this developing talent and falling in love with everything Music City had to offer. \u201cComing here for the first time felt like walking into a dreamland,\u201d she says. She made the move to Nashville permanently four years ago, at just nineteen \u2013 driving 45 hours from Grande Prairie.\n\nOnce settled in Nashville, Townes spent her days songwriting and her nights at guitar pulls or at the Bluebird, studying everything she could. Eventually, she scored a publishing deal with Big Yellow Dog, and headed into the studio with Joyce to record her debut. Together, they tapped into her organic nature and her sheer ability to tell a story and emote it through the visceral range of her vocals \u2013 tender, bluesy, wise and full of wonder but never naive. \u201cHe has a way of pulling out people\u2019s most honest self,\u201d says Townes of her experience working with Joyce. \u201cI always loved telling stories and writing songs, and a lot of these songs deal with things that are hard to talk about. Concepts about losing someone and asking hard questions and about seeking whatever your sense of faith is. Songs about looking for love.\u201d Songs, most importantly, from the heart.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because Townes\u2019 heart is huge. At fifteen, she organized a fundraiser called Big Hearts For Big Kids benefiting a youth shelter in her home town. To this day, they\u2019ve continued it yearly and raised over $1.5 million dollars \u2013 Townes was inspired to start the event by a pamphlet her mother brought home one day, not an uncommon occurrence at her house. \u201cWe\u2019d sit around the dinner table and talk about what was going on in the world, homelessness and loneliness,\u201d she says, \u201cand I grew up being aware of those things. The parts of human existence that remind us we are all more similar than we think we are. And those stories need to be told.\u201d\n\nAfter school, she continued this ethos by launching a tour called Play It Forward, where she spent 32 weeks on the road, visiting 106 schools and playing music for over 35,000 students. Meant to encourage leadership and inspire youth, it was a huge success and completely born out of Townes\u2019 own scrappy sense of \u201canything is possible.\u201d Some of the stories she heard along the way even inspire songs on her debut LP. The idea of community that she grew up with comes through, too. Her music is that kitchen table, her words are the experiences and struggles and moments of joy she wants to share, packed with her dynamic vocals and, at the core, that heart. \u201cMusic pushes walls down you didn\u2019t know were up,\u201d she says. \u201cA song will take you places you didn\u2019t even ask it to, and I\u2019m always thankful that it does.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Brandy Clark's You Can\u2019t Come Over (But You Can Come In)"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rick Wonder ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8912713.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Electro House", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New York native Rick Wonder has become one of the tri-state area\u2019s premiere DJs in nightlife, with residencies at elite venues including 1OAK, Catch Roof and Providence.

The little kid with the big voice grew up listening to records from Ray Charles, Ronnie Dunn, and, of course, the greatest of them all: Frank Sinatra. His parents bought a guitar and a small sound system for Eldredge when he was a teen, and while he didn\u2019t immediately take to the instrument \u2013 \u201cI never could sit still long enough to learn it,\u201d he admits \u2013 the sound system and its wireless microphone became a cornerstone of his early musical training. By age 15, Eldredge was a performer in demand for local functions. \u201cI really grew to love the feel of the crowd,\u201d he says.\n\nEldredge says there was no question that his passion for performance would carry him to Nashville, but his move to Music City after college made one thing clear: He was going to have to pick up that abandoned guitar. \u201cI saw people on stage playing these songwriter nights, just them and a guitar,\u201d he says. So Eldredge locked himself in a room to practice, and eventually started writing songs of his own. \u201cIt took me a while to finally get a hold of the guitar, but once I did I was hooked,\u201d he says. \u201cI think being a student of singers works to my advantage, because it taught me how to phrase things. I had melodies all over the place in my head.\u201d\n\nHe has since moved on to writing with some of Nashville\u2019s greats, including the legendary \u201cWhispering\u201d Bill Anderson, who taught him that one of the tricks to being a great songwriter is to \u201cjust keep writing,\u201d Eldredge says. Two singles he\u2019s released so far certainly prove his range: His 2010 debut, \u201cRaymond,\u201d was inspired in part by Eldredge\u2019s own grandmother and her struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s. Current single \u201cDon\u2019t Ya\u201d hits the opposite end of the spectrum, an up-tempo flirtation that ponders the mystery of romantic relations, and showcases the sexy baritone in Eldredge\u2019s voice. And during his own high-energy live shows, just like that kid with the wireless mic, Eldredge goes out of his way to connect with every member of the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s the place I feel more alive than anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything it takes to get to wherever I\u2019m going to play \u2013 every airplane and car I ride in \u2013 is so worth it once I\u2019m able to get up on that stage. I want everybody in the crowd to feel the energy that I\u2019m feeling from them.\u201d\n\nAs he continues to work hard at the craft of songwriting, there\u2019s no question his talent will grow along with his audience. \u201cYou can create something from nothing, and that\u2019s the coolest thing in the world to me,\u201d Eldredge says. \u201cThis new music is me, and it\u2019s taken every song I\u2019ve written up to this point to get to where I am. I feel better about my music now than I ever have felt, and I can\u2019t wait for people to hear it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eugenio Derbez ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam Ezra Group ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9011372.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Contemporary Folk, Rock, Folk, Americana, Roots Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Talk to any Adam Ezra Group fan around the country and they\u2019ll tell you that each AEG performance is a one-of-a-kind, community-driven experience, propelled by the spirit of the people in front of the stage.

While Ezra has played with an array of musicians over the years, his current line-up featuring Corinna Smith on fiddle, Alex Martin on drums, and Poche Ponce on bass has been creating a new buzz around the country, as evidenced by their mind numbing tour schedule, ballooning tickets sales, and opening features with The Wallflowers, Galactic, John Oates, The Wailers, Southside Johnny, Graham Parker, and America.\n\nNot believing in set lists, every AEG show provides new and unique concert experiences that the band has been recording in real time and sharing with fans on thumbs drives as part of their \"Live Sound Project\" every night. Go to any Adam Ezra show, solo or with the group, and you will not only find fans who have traveled vast distances to be there, but also doubtless a fair number of rabid followers accumulating as many AEG shows as possible throughout the year.\n\nThe fall of 2019 had AEG on more headlining tours supporting their 19th & 20th album releases and the latest in a series of enhanced, remixed, live albums, aptly named \"Better Than Bootleg Vol 3\"(Aug 24, 2019) and \"Better Than Bootleg Vol 4\" (Dec 27, 2019).

He developed interest in songwriting and, before long, was looking to put together a band and hosting try-outs for singers. It wasn't until friends told Adam that his voice didn't sound half-bad that he put any thought into singing.\n\n\n\nThroughout the years since, Adam's been involved in several projects - most notably his original band Black Magnolia. The band\u2019s debut album, \u201cFields Are Burning,\" was released in 2012 and featured Randy Jackson of Zebra, who played a guest guitar solo on the song \u201cApocalypse.\u201d He's opened for several major bands in his day including Zebra, 12 Stones, Filter, Puddle of Mudd, and Louisiana Leroux. He\u2019s also played major festivals throughout the South who's had headliners such as Foreigner, Kiss, Doobie Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Temptations, Sublime with Rome, Dee Snider, and Cowboy Mouth.\n\n\n\nAdam's success grew substantially following his appearance on NBC's \"The Voice\". He chose Adam Levine as his coach and made it to the Top 20 on Season 13 (as the \"comeback kid\" from Season 12). Shortly afterwards, Adam Levine invited him to sing for the Maroon 5 Annual Halloween party in 2017. That night they covered only AC/DC songs with Adam Pearce singing, Adam Levine on drums, James Valentine and Andrew Watt on guitar, and Milo Decruz on bass. The night became extra memorable when Sammy Hagar jumped on stage to join Adam Pearce singing \"Highway to Hell.\" The night before, they also surprised guests and performed for the Casamigos Annual Halloween Party.\n\n\n\nIn Decemeber 2017, thanks to the support of his amazing Backers, Adam launched a very successful Kickstarter Campaign which allowed him to bring his newest songs to life with a new album. This new album was recently released October 31, 2018 as Adam Pearce: WARBIRD, featuring Kyle Thomas of Exhorder, Terry McDermott of Lotus Crush, and Paul Mirkovich who's plays keys for and sings duets with Cher.\n\n\n\nAdam can currently be found performing his solo acoustic gigs as well as playing with his full band, Adam Pearce & The Warbirds, all over the state and across the south.

They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ed Helms LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Whiskey Sour Happy Hour Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Harold L\u00f3pez-Nussa LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8687449.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Jazz, Piano Jazz, Jazz Instrument, Latin Jazz, Cuban Jazz, Contemporary Jazz", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Un D\u00eda Cualquiera, pianist HAROLD L\u00d3PEZ-NUSSA\u2018s second release for Mack Avenue Records, represents this musical vantage point with force and innovation.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago.

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe. Their show is a carnival of two that will take you from the Moulin Rouge to CBGBs and back again.

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015. Previous projects include Home to You from 2010, Topaz City in 2007; One of the Ways, 2002; Wide Afternoon, 2000; Comfort In the Curves, 1997; and three live releases (Sell-Out, 2006; Live From The Granada CD/DVD 2009 and Live At The Mucky Duck - Portmanteau, 2019).

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to. All that matters is that I keep doing what I love to do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Way Back Wednesday"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dawes LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8739115.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New album PASSWORDS out now.\nhttp://smarturl.it/dawes-passwords", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Elden Kelly LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9066648.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Jazz Fusion, Classical, Instrumental, World Fusion, Jazz, Classical Crossover", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.eldenkelly.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Barnyard Stompers LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9183255.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Outlaw Country, Southern Rock, Dirty Blues, Folk, Americana, Country, Rock, Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hard working, traveling outlaw circus!

It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating. But now everyone's going through something. And as difficult as that is, there's comfort in that too. Because we're all in it together, and we have been the whole time. Except now we can actually feel it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Deniro Farrar LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7971893.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/baby-tv-presents-deniro-farrar-with-trent-the-hooligan-tickets-103099583630"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jay Ungar & Molly Mason LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7083497.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Country, Appalachian, Americana, Folk, Swing", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jay Ungar & Molly Mason performance of Jay's haunting composition Ashokan Farewell \u2014 the musical hallmark of the PBS series \u2014 earned the couple international acclaim.

With his fingerstyle technique, his compositions defy categorization and blend various forms and styles, including folk, rock, jazz, blues, country, world and roots. Incorporating a textured sound all his own and sense of economy in phrasing, Ray is a soulful player who lets his instrument sing, wringing emotion from every note. In the end, it's all about conveying an emotion and taking the listener away.\n\nRay Montford\u2019s new and long-awaited seventh studio album, Share My Sky, is the acclaimed guitarist\u2019s first recording in six years. Exploring the themes of loss, grief, trauma, compassion, forgiveness and love, Montford has expanded his sonic range and compositional depth to offer his most personal and emotional statement to date. Collaborating with singer/songwriter Lynn Moffatt, he co-wrote Deliver Me, a song that embodies the universal feelings of loneliness and belonging, while specifically shining light on the fate of refugees who strive to land in a safe place - a topical theme in these troubled times. The strong presence of singers Sheena Turcotte and Anouk Michelle-Gr\u00e9goire on this recording (a first in Ray\u2019s career) lends tremendous poignancy to songs Alive and Let Your River Flow, while the album\u2019s profoundly reflective title track, composed upon his return from Bali, rates as one of the most evocative melodies the guitarist has ever written.\n\nBorn in Ottawa, Ray began learning by ear and woodshedding with the great rock records of that era. After studying audio engineering, production, and performance in the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College and doing a term in the music program at Humber, he began writing and recording his own music, and by 1995 was dedicating most of his priorities in that discipline. Between 1994-'97, he was the guitar player for the Rankins and from 1997-'99, Mary Jane Lamond. His compositions have been heard on National CBC radio and have been licensed for various television series. For more than 20 years Ray and his rhythm section featuring some of Canada's best players, have played for audiences and loyal fans at music festivals, clubs, theatres, house concerts and private parties. They toured parts of Europe in 2001, shared the stage with the Tony Levin Band (alumnae of Peter Gabriel) in 2003 and sold out the Young Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto for the release of A Fragile Balance in 2007. Recently, they played the Oakville Centre for the Performing Arts to a sold-out audience, the Oakville Jazz Festival (2010 & 2012), Markham Jazz Festival (2012), and the Canadian Guitar Festival (2009, 2011 & 2014).\n\nRay has gratefully received support from the Ontario Arts Council, Toronto Arts Council, Factor and External Affairs as well as sponsorship from Totem Acoustic and Paradigm for his compostions, recording and performances.

There, she found herself gravitating toward the sounds, stories, and swagger of country music, a genre that had been so prevalent back home. Formed in 2014, Honey County brought all three women together, kicking off a whirlwind career that has since found the group receiving praise from Rolling Stone; playing gigs alongside Lady Antebellum and Old Dominion; enjoying high-profile slots at CMA Fest and Stagecoach Festival; and receiving heavy airplay for independent singles like \"Love Someone\" (one of the most-played songs during the launch of Radio Disney Country),\" \"High on the Radio\", \"Los Angeles\", and \u201cCigarette\u201d.\n\nYou won't find Honey County on any map. Instead, the group takes its name from a fictional place, a move that allows the bandmates to create their own landscape of story-driven country, melodic pop, and punchy, guitar-fueled rock. It's a sound that leans heavily on the powerful blend of three voices, punctuated by songwriting chops that evoke both the sunny beauty of the band's California headquarters as well as the Bible Belt bounce of Nashville. With all three members trading vocal duties and sharing songwriting credits, Honey County sounds as sweet at its name.\n\nThe group has been busy, too. one of the only independent acts to play Stagecoach Festival and CMA Fest in 2017 and again in 2019, Honey County earned a thumbs up from Rolling Stone Country, who praised the band's songwriting and harmony-heavy live show.\n\nGenuine fans of the country music tradition, the members of Honey County have also paid tribute to their influences, creating covers of hit songs like Little Big Town's \"Girl Crush\" (whose video earned more than 129,000 views on YouTube), Garth Brooks' \"People Loving People\" (whose recording notched over half a million spins on Spotify), and Maren Morris' \"I Could Use a Love Song.\" Even so, they've created more of a stir with their own music. Produced by John Spiker and Maks Gabriel, Honey County's first summertime single, \"High On The Radio,\" became one of the first songs to receive airplay on SoCal Country radio station Radio Disney Country in mid-2017. Tapped as a trending music video on CMT.com, the song's accompanying video premiered on E! News, shining a light on three singers who were meant to perform together.\n\nReleased later that summer, \"Love Someone,\" also received heavy airplay on E! News, while also receiving nods from Apple Music's 'Cool Country' Playlist and the iTunes Country Music Hot Tracks. With more than 16,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and a new single \u2014 the dark, Fleetwood Mac-inspired \"Los Angeles\" \u2014 under the band's belt, Honey County carried their momentum into 2018, with more melody-heavy songs and cross-country shows on the horizon.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ritt Momney LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351738.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Indie", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Booking: Lee anderson landerson@paradigmagency.com and Len Chenfeld lchenfeld@paradigmagency.com", "otherInfo": "\"This virtual tour is my attempt at giving back to the venues that give artists like me their start.

The multi-million selling country icon is set to embark on a tour commemorating the 30th anniversary of his groundbreaking debut album Killin\u2019 Time, which all but altered the landscape of country music. Three decades later, Clint remains humble as ever about the massive influence he has had on the genre.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I was leading a change in country music,\u201d Clint remarks. \u201cIt just felt like big success to me. I would hear things like, \u2018So-and-so is going to record, and they\u2019re using their own band because you did.\u2019 Or, \u2018So-and-so wants to write more of their own songs, because you did.\u2019 But I don\u2019t feel like I changed anything, other than contributing my work to the big picture. It\u2019s hard to look at myself and see the impact I\u2019ve had. I do know that my songs have touched a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIf Black won\u2019t say it outright, his staggering career speaks for itself. His is one of the most storied careers in modern music. Black surged to superstardom as part of the fabled Class of '89, reaching #1 with five consecutive singles from his triple-platinum debut, Killin' Time. He followed that with the triple-platinum Put Yourself in My Shoes, and then a string of platinum and gold albums throughout the '90s. Perhaps most impressively, Clint wrote or co-wrote every one of his more than three dozen chart hits, including \"A Better Man,\" \"Where Are You Now,\" \"When My Ship Comes In,\" \"A Good Run of Bad Luck,\" \"Summer's Comin',\" \"Like the Rain\" and \"Nothin' But the Taillights,\" part of a catalog that produced 22 #1 singles and made him one of the most successful singer/songwriters of the modern era. Along the way, he\u2019s earned more than a dozen gold and platinum awards in the U.S. and Canada, landed nearly two dozen major awards and nominations, won a GRAMMY Award, countless Country Music Association, American Music Awards and Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nRaised in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, Clint Black is the youngest of four brothers. He began performing with brother, Kevin at the family\u2019s backyard barbecues. After high school, he spent 10 years on the local nightclub circuit and in 1989, he led a movement of young talent that transformed country music leading into the \u201890s.\n\nIn 2004, he scaled the top of the charts by trading lines with Buffett, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Toby Keith and Kenny Chesney on the Hank Williams classic \u201cHey Good Looking.\u2019\u201d He contributed \u201cThe Great Mississippi Flood\" to the 2005 post-Katrina charity album Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now. He released albums in 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nHis interest in releasing new music waned when his record label closed its doors in 2008. He explains, \u201cI had interest from major companies to sign deals, but declined\u201d.\nClint Black has hardly been idle since then. He\u2019s written and produced songs for Hasbro\u2019s children\u2019s shows and in 2010 and 2012 starred in the films Flicka 2 and Flicka: Country Pride, the latter with his wife and daughter.\n\nIn 2013, the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain began marketing an album of Black\u2019s hits, which continues to sell strongly and in early 2015, he collaborated with Joe Nichols on a Superstar Duets NBC-TV special for the Academy of Country Music.\nIn 2015 released On Purpose, his first studio album of new material in nearly a decade. He dedicated the album to his father, who passed away in 2012.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a huge country fan and is the first reason I listen to country music. He is probably the reason I\u2019m a songwriter today. He was my introduction to \"who\u2019s behind the music\". I grew up wanting to be the writer behind the song. That really all started with him.\u201d\n2018 was a particularly busy year for the Class of \u201889 alum. Always finding ways to challenge himself creatively, Clint produced his first ever holiday musical, titled Looking For Christmas, which focuses on family, love, and the magic of Christmas. It\u2019s expected to tour in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis has been in the works for a while now and it was great to see the audience reaction. Working with James Sasser has been both a blessing and a learning experience and I believe that the story is relatable to many Americans, both young and old.\u201d\nNow, with the 30th anniversary of Killin\u2019 Time approaching, Clint has earned the right to sit back, and let his body of work speak for itself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alex Maas LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "At Home with ACL Livestream: https://www.facebook.com/events/255578335638835"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tony Lucca LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10131981.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Rock, Singer-songwriter", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tony Lucca is a Nashville-based singer/songwriter whose catalog of music runs the gamut from soul-infused pop to tear-jerker folk balladry.

He plays jazz piano with the harmonic sophistication and deep sense of swing that only comes from more than four decades on the bandstand. At the same time, his recordings have consistently landed at the top of the New Adult Contemporary (NAC)/Smooth Jazz charts, a genre of music Tom helped pioneer in the mid-80s. As the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most renowned musical artist, Tom Grant\u2019s career achievements reflect his unique ability to embrace the full spectrum of contemporary music. Born to show business parents, Tom was at home with many musical instruments, but always returned to the piano. At a tender age, he was taught to play piano and drums by his tap dancer father. Later, he learned about music styles listening to music at his father\u2019s record store in Portland, Oregon. His brother, an avant-garde jazz pianist, introduced him to the many different facets of jazz music.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oregon and a short stint as a high school teacher, Tom answered his musical calling. Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper took Tom to New York in 1970 to record the chant classic Witchi-tai-to. After that, he toured and recorded with such jazz greats as Woody Shaw, Joe Henderson, Charles Lloyd and Tony Williams. Since 1983, Tom\u2019s records have repeatedly topped the Smooth Jazz charts. Several, including the popular Mango Tango, Night Charade, In My Wildest Dreams, and The View from Here, enjoyed lengthy stays at Number One. Tom\u2019s music has been a staple of terrestrial and internet radio both in the U.S. and around the world. His compositions are also used in TV and Films worldwide. He has been featured on CNN and the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tom is also a tireless worker for humanitarian and charitable causes. He has a scholarship established in his name by the United Negro College Fund. In 1999 Tom was also given the Humanitarian Award for Dedication to Music, Health and Children by the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell Medical Center.\n\nMore recently he has dedicated himself to numerous charity projects for the under-funded public schools in the Northwest, Potluck in the Park, a charity that feeds hungry people in the Portland area, and the Edwards Center for handicapped adults. In 2001, Tom started recording on his own record label, Nu-Wrinkle Records. After nearly 35 years of recording on various labels (Windham Hill, Verve, Shanachie, PAUSA, Gaia, WMOT, Timeless International, Chase Music) he felt it was time to explore the world of self-produced music.

Described as \"the whole package\" by Kylie Minogue on The Voice, the singer-songwriter grew up on a rural property outside Canberra and now calls Sydney home.\n\nHayley has experienced a breakout 18-month period with her sophomore album \u2018Past Tense and Present Peace\u2019, achieving her first iTunes #1 chart position and follow up single \u2018Summertime Soundtrack\u2019 hitting #1 on Australian Country Radio Charts.\nHer hard work was rewarded with a Southern Stars \u2018Rising Female Artist\u2019 Award and a Top 5 finalist position at the 2018 Country Music Channel (CMC) Awards for \u2018New Artist of the Year'. She was also a semi-finalist in the International Songwriting Competition for her single \u2019This Love\u2019.\n\nOff the back of these outstanding achievements, Hayley recently signed with Social Family Records, and released her album 'Turning Up The Dial' in May 2018. The album was the 3rd highest selling Australian Country Album according to ARIA, and the 2nd highest selling digital album on iTunes Country charts, amongst the esteemed company of country icons, Keith Urban and Kasey Chambers. \u2018Turning Up The Dial\u2019 also hit #16 in the ARIA Australian Albums (all genre) Charts.\n\nIn a recent review by Country Music Capital News it was said, \u201cHayley Jensen takes it up a notch in this album. It\u2019s country pop vibes reflect the vivacious and charismatic nature of this established artist and showcases her superior vocal talents.\u201d\n\nProduced in Nashville USA with Grammy Award winning producer, Jamie Tate at The Rukkus Room, the album features some of the finest musicians in the world, including electric guitarist Jeff King (Reba McEntire, Faith Hill), drummer Tommy Harden (Kip Moore, Blake Shelton) keys player David Dorn (Rascal Flatts, Lauren Alaina, Kelsea Ballerini) and acoustic guitarist Pat McGrath (Eric Paslay, Lee Brice, Luke Bryan). All songs were written or co-written by Hayley, alongside hit writers including Phil Barton, Jerry Salley, and local artists Kirsty-Lee Akers and Natalie Person to name a few.\n\nHayley launched \u2018Turning Up The Dial\u2019 at a jam-packed launch tour across the south east coast of Australia before heading to Manchester in the UK to perform as a headline international act at Buckle & Boots Country Music Festival, where her song \u2018Summertime Soundtrack\u2019 has since been dubbed the official festival soundtrack. At the festival, Hayley performed alongside popular international acts, American Young (US), Filmore (US), Jenn Bostic (US) and The Wandering Hearts (UK).\n\nThe international festival opportunities continue this year. Hayley has been invited to perform at two massive festivals in Canada - Calgary Stampede Coca Cola Stage (Alberta) & Dauphin\u2019s CountryFest (Manitoba), the longest running country music festival in Canada for their 30th Anniversary. At both festivals, Hayley will be the only Australian artist in the line-up.\n\nGrowing up in regional Australia, Hayley was attracted to the honest storytelling and authenticity of country music. Her musical journey has been eclectic, bursting onto the scene to become a household name as a Top 4 finalist on the 2nd season of Australian Idol, she has performed for Coalition Forces in the Middle East, coached aspiring artists in the Solomon Islands, won a coveted MusicOz Award, and was mentored by Kylie Minogue on The Voice Australia. Her 'blind audition' from the show has gone on to receive close to 2 Million views on YouTube.\n\nHayley has since been embraced by the genre that inspired her as a child - where she feels most 'at home' personally, vocally and as a songwriter. In the past 2 years, Jensen has release five hit singles, with music videos appearing daily on Foxtel's CMC. Each release has charted higher than the previous, with \u2018Summertime Soundtrack\u2019, \u2018Saturday Night\u2019 & \u2018This Love\u2019 featuring in the CMC Top 30 and KIX Country rotations.\n\n'Summertime Soundtrack' was added to the \u2018Fresh Country\u2019 playlist on Spotify, as well as the \u2018Aussie Country\u2019 and \u2018Pure Country\u2019 playlists on Apple Music accumulating over 150,000 streams across platforms.\n\nThe past two years have seen an influx of new country fans connecting with Hayley and her music on social media, with her online following more than tripling across major digital platforms. This following has been nurtured in real life through stellar performances on the festival circuit across Australia, and abroad.\n\nJensen has recently released the fifth single, \u2018Next Big Thing\u2019, from her album. Launching three brand new remixes (Country Rock, Electronic/Dance & Country Pop). The Rukkus Room Remix (Country Rock) is currently shooting up the KIX Country Hot 20 and the Transient Park Remix (Electronic/Dance) debuted in the Top 20 (#19) in the iTunes Dance Charts.

It only took eight years of waiting for one of the most unique artists to finally deliver a new dose of contemporary electro pyrotechnics and a worthy successor to the smashing Total. During those eight years, SebastiAn successfully completed a 360\u00b0 turn. Plus, it\u2019s been eight years of putting his talent to the good use of others (Frank Ocean, Philippe Katerine, Charlotte Gainsbourg) to help him get to where he wants to be today. From European electro to American R&B via classic pop, Thirst sets ablaze all genres. His taste for explosive mechanisms (like his well-known \u201cturbine\u201d techno sub-genre label-mates at Ed Banger) made Total an elegantly revolutionary debut album that captivatingly took things to the extreme, while being as frightening as a ticking bomb. But now, the wait is over. Thirst bursts forward providing an amazing opening to brand new worlds. This 14-track adventure narrates the journey of how he mastered machines, his own demons and even several time zones.\n\n\u201cThe general approach to this record corresponds to the time when Frank Ocean called me in Paris, telling me I had to be in Los Angeles the next day to work alongside him,\u201d reveals SebastiAn. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019d met Charlotte Gainsbourg to produce her latest album. So I found myself working with these two opposing personalities: on one side you\u2019ve got Frank Ocean, who\u2019s ultra charismatic and fanciful, while on the other, Charlotte Gainsbourg is both an introvert yet so openly real. When Charlotte moved to New York, Frank landed in London, and so the work process suddenly switched. I found this really interesting. My record came about from all the encounters I made going between these two projects.\u201d The energy from such contrasts brought this project to life, provoking SebastiAn to call upon an impressive list of artists to feature on Thirst (Syd from The Internet, Mayer Hawthorne, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Allan Kingdom, Sevdaliza, Cautious Clay, Sunni Col\u00f2n, Sparks, Gallant and Loota). \u201cFrom Ed Banger to Jean-Louis Costes and Katerine, or Frank Ocean to Charlotte Gainsbourg, my music has always looked to build bridges,\u201d outlines the self-confessed fan of DJ Premier, Giorgio Moroder and Suicide, who\u2019s managed to bring different styles together as one on this record. From this head-on collision between cold European techno and the warm tones of R&B, hip-hop and American gospel comes a series of explosions which progressively topple towards unchartered territories. With a certain Slavic melancholy that\u2019s an homage to his roots, SebastiAn makes the single Beograd evolve from metronomic dirty disco to a melody of cinematographic stature worthy of De Roubaix, entangled in a Chopin-esque lamenting sonata. The art of SebastiAn is certainly the art of suspense. He\u2019s like a tightrope walker, juggling a balancing act from the intimate to the epic (just take Run For Me which is a tour de force), and from minimalism to baroque to create a mystical form of electronic music. Thirst has such a contemporary edge to it, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s not aiming for a total collision between music\u2019s major current trends (electro and R&B), but in fact he\u2019s looking to rearrange the rules, settling alight the history of pop (The Beach Boys-eque Better Now) and rock (Handcuffed To A Parking Meter reaching dizzying heights with his idols Sparks), and a certain classicism in a recurring dialogue between strings, piano and knob-twiddling machines.\n\nIn 2011, for the cover work for Total, Jean-Baptiste Mondino captured SebastiAn as a modern-day Narcissus, photographing the musician kissing his alter ego. Eight years later, the same photographer once again depicts the artist with his double, however this time the love affair has ended and it\u2019s fists up ready for a fight. To sum up this game of metaphors, Thirst is a beefed-up declaration of love - not of SebastiAn to himself, but to the world around him. Thirst leaves you thirsty for more.", "otherInfo": "Meditate with Stuart"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SK Shlomo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359656.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Electronic, Beatbox", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After collaborating with Ed Sheeran, Bjork and Damon Albarn, award winning singer-songwriter, beatboxer, producer & live looping technologist SK Shlomo's acclaimed debut solo album 'Surrender' is out now raising #MentalHealthAwareness: http://skshlomo.com/listen", "otherInfo": "This Thursday, and for the next 6 Thursdays at 2pm BST, I'm launching a weekly livestream called Homeskool Beatbox Adventures to help isolated families and raise funds for NHS Charities Together.\n\nWe're partnering with 80 music venues to simulcast the livestream to thousands of homes worldwide, with weekly special guests including Basement Jaxx, Bastille, Bill Bailey, Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall and Radio 1\u2019s Dr Radha helping me to raise a target of \u00a32500 to help frontline staff, patients and families affected by COVID19.\n\nThe show will be livestreamed on our brand new beatboxadventures.com website, on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAnd you can be part of the show!\n\nEach week I am inviting a virtual studio audience of up to 50 lucky families to join me in our digital theatre - also known as the \u2018Zoom Room\u2019.

Their catchy-sensitive pop/rock sound is, every gig again, a big succes.\n\nWhen they're performing live, pEter turns out to be an energy-explosion.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

They took their name from the famous French painter Henri Matisse.\n\nMatisse was originally formed in 1997 by Aris Siafas, Giannis Massouras, Grigoris \u039aolias, Petros Tsolis, Kostas Synodinos and Basilis Zervos without making any significant actions as a band. The band became active, when they started performing and writing songs for the first time in January 1999. In the beginning of their career the band was making live performances, mostly in small venues in Athens. Still though, they didn't have enough money for recordings. Matisse have also supported many acts including Reamonn, Puressence, Shed Seven, The Frank and Walters, Drugstore. They continued their live performances and demonstrations for the next three years, until they signed a contract with Sony BMG Greece in 2001. By winter of 2002, they began recording their EP 4 (Four), which was released in the summer of 2003.\n\nTwo years after the release of their EP 4 (Four), in June 2005 Matisse released their debut album Cheap As Art which hit the #3 spot on Pop & Rock Magazine's \"Best of the Year List\". The lead single of the album She Smiles, became a radio classic. Enthusiastically received by the critics Cheap As Art set off the band to a great start.\n\nA few days after the release of their debut, Matisse opened the first day of the Rockwave Festival as supporting act for Garbage and Marilyn Manson. Their performance was welcomed by journalists and public alike. In the begining of 2006, the band started writing material for their second album, with few changes in their line-up; Kostas Synodinos departed from the group and Petros Tsolis was replaced by Nikos Manosopulos. In December of the same year they also supported Kaiser Chiefs in their live performance in Greece. In May 2007 their second album Toys Up was released.\n\nIn 2007, Aris Siafas left the band for personal reasons. He was replaced by Alex Kavadias, a Greek-Australian singer. The band re-released Toys Up, in deluxe edition, with videos, remixes, as well as a new mix from their cover on Cyndi Lauper's song \"She Bop\" performed by their new singer Alex.\n\nOfficial Site:\nhttp://www.matisse.gr", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Solardo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8420546.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Techno, House, Tech House", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Widely considered as modern-day kings of the underground, Mancunian duo Solardo (James Eliot & Mark Richards, aka MRK1) continue to blitz all before them, amassing widespread plaudits for their role as not just hugely popular DJs, but also label owners, and innovative forward-thinking producers.

Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards.\n\nThe love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK.\n\nMusic aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat.\n\nFollowing on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island.\n\nThe duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair. With all this in mind, Solardo will go into 2020 as one of dance music\u2019s truly premiere names.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sharon, Lois & Bram ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10117806.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Family Friendly, Folk, Family Music", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LP Giobbi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10367591.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Disco, House, Electro Pop, Electro House, Dance Pop", "Time": "5:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LP Giobbi is rock \u2019n roll with a disco soul, born draped in sequins and cloaked in fog at a seance in the mountains of Oregon.\n\nShe was trained in jazz piano at UC Berkeley before becoming a synth warrior goddess in Los Angeles.

Formed by Denis \"Piggy\" D'Amour, Michel \"Away\" Langevin and Jean-Yves \"Blacky\" Theriault, the fledging group soon found the perfect singer in Denis \"Snake\" Belanger. A blend of thrash with some progressive rock thrown in, and lyrics leaning heavily on sci-fi imagery. One of the first Canadian punk and thrash bands to enjoy success outside of Canada, they released four albums in the mid '80s before being signed to a major label. War And Pain in 1984, Rrroooaaarrr! in 1986, Killing Technology in 1987, and Dimension Hatross in 1988. Their blend of thrash and progressive rock caught the ear of MCA Records, who signed them and released their next album, Nothingface in 1989. The video of their Pink Floyd cover, Astronomy Domine, got tons of MTV airplay. They would headline a club tour with bands like Soundgarden and Faith No More, relative unknowns at the time, opening for them.\n\nThings started slowly sliding downhill for them after, their next album being poorly received, 1991's Angel Rat. 'grunge' was taking hold, with bands such as their former opening act, Soundgarden, enjoying a rise to stardom. Blacky left the band quickly after Angel Rat's release. 1993 saw the release of The Outer Limits album. Following the subsequent tour, Snake quit Voivod. The former Liquid Indian man, Eric \"E-Force\" Forrest replaced Blacky and Snake in one fell swoop on bass and lead vocals, and would stay with the band for two albums, 1995's Negatron and 1997's Phobos. 2000 saw an EP (Kronik) and live album (Lives), and in 2001 a car accident invalidated E-Force with a broken back. The group was put on hiatus, until eventually the decision was made to reform the band with Snake. Voivod fan Jason Newsted, fresh from Metallica, filled the vacant bass slot. This version of the band would go on to release 2003's self-titled album, Voivod.\n\nGuitarist Denis \"Piggy\" D'Amour sadly died on 25th August 2005 from colon cancer aged 45. After his diagnosis he spent the last 2 months of his life recording ideas & guitar parts for several albums worth of new songs. After his death the rest of the band completed work on Voivod's 14th album, Katorz, released in July 2006.\n\nIn addition to Jason Newsted, they had a few other well-known fans, including Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt of Opeth, Nocturno Culto of Darkthrone and Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters fame. Dave Grohl was such a big fan while growing up that he would even invite their singer, Snake, to join him for a track on his Probot side project, on which he worked with several singers from rock/thrash/death metal bands he really enjoyed in his younger days.

A band that truly walks it's own path proudly and shows some new exciting sides on identifiable character. A band of many directions and styles, some of them clearly visible while others were more unseen - namely working and keeping it all together under the moniker of melodic life-and-death metal and bastardizing it with various influences. Adult oriented death metal that it is!\n\n\"THE DEMOS\"\n\nDuring the first spring rays of 1996 a thing called OMNIUM GATHERUM took its first steps and shapes in a gloomy and oily cellar in the south-eastern harbour town of Kotka in Finland. Omnipotent young fellas Markus Vanhala and Olli Lappalainen (who's still a part of the band as an art designer & have made all the OG artworks since the very first demo) were extremely influenced by the rapidly ascending wave of scandinavian melodic death metal and the polar alliance between brutal death metal spiced with the despairing Finnish melancholy. The result of intensive training was seen as a four demos; \"Forbidden Decay\" '97, \"OG-ep\"'98, \"Gardens, Temples...This Hell!\" '99 & \"Wastrel\" '01, that built up a quality cult following in the underground scene and set standards for the up-coming.\n\n\"STEAL THE LIGHT\" 2002\n\nAfter the highly acclaimed \"Wastrel\" demo the band signed a deal with the growing UK metal label Rage Of Achilles and were sent right away to the Sonic Pump studio in Helsinki with Nino Laurenne to re-record their latest demo as debut EP entitled \"Steal The Light\" during the last days of 2001. The debut EP was released after a long, long wait in September 2002 and both the critics and the audience seemed to like the stuff and the metal medias awakened for the new Finns.\n\n\"SPIRITS AND AUGUST LIGHT\" 2003\n\nThe debut full-length album \"Spirits And August Light\" was released in April 2003 via Rage Of Achilles and gave the band some well deserved attention within the underground metal community and the press. The album showed another side to the light: despite the clear and catchy melodies and the stable rhythm all along the way it had a lifelike taste of dirtiness to it, with desperate love and uninvited hate searching for an outlet, like something you didn't want to see happen but it did nonetheless. The reviews were unbelievably great, for example being the only Finnish band then so far with a debut review of 5/5 in Kerrang! and all the major metal magazines followed in the same vein. So far, so good... so what!\n\n\"YEARS IN WASTE\" 2004\n\nNext in line to be was the band signing to a metal giant label\nNuclear Blast in the autumn of 2004 to release the second album \"Years In Waste\", as also re-issues from the \"Steal The Light/Spirits And August Light\" via NB. More technical, more progressive and\nsophisticated, thus naturally more difficult also, while at the same\ntime keeping distance to the listener. The new recipe was completed\nwith themes from the wasted youth and the verses of fall. \"YIW\" showed another way out from the great depression, and OG did the first festival appearances outside Finland. In the spring 2006 an era came to an end. The long-time singer Antti Filppu was replaced by Jukka Pelkonen aka J.\n\n\"STUCK HERE ON SNAKES WAY\" 2007\n\nThe debut album of \"The new OmG\" - featuring J on vocals - was released in April 2007 after a successful UK headlining tour and signing with British Candlelight Records. \"Snakes Way\" is an endless road dealing with the choices in our existence and the temptation within the mind of every soul on this third planet of ours, and unfortunately so many people are stuck. Gladly OG didn't get stuck with the album and the \"Snakes Way\" conducted the band to do tours abroad with Dark Tranquillity, Caliban and Entombed, spiced with a large amount of Finnish headlining gigs and the #31 position in the Finnish national album chart!\n\n\"THE REDSHIFT\" 2008\n\nThe 4th album \"The Redshift\" & year 2008 introduced the camp OG in its very strongest form seen yet. The album were recorded in the spring days of 2008 once again by their court engineer Teemu Aalto and it was mixed/mastered at Unisound Studio in Sweden by the legendary metal-mastermind Dan Swan\u00c3\u00b6 himself, who even commented the album with his nice words: \"You won't find a better album in years!\" The album was full of contrasts; melodic but yet brutal, lots of changing atmospheres, moods from sorrow to joy and from hope to despair, very catchy but still stand outs after lots of listens and the sands of time. The album themes are about that certainty, when you reach a point in your existence that makes you transform into something new and improved, It is about going faster and yet more calmly than ever before, It is a salute to knowing oneself and the space that is around! The redshift riders were sent to playing all over the Europe about 100 shows in support of the album, doing festivals and tours in Europe alongside Nile, Grave, Swallow The Sun, Insomnium & Dark Tranquillity, and even gained a #24 position in the Finnish album chart. Change for the better!\n\n\"NEW WORLD SHADOWS\" 2011\n\nDuring anno 2010 OG signed to Lifeforce Records and started to record their new masterpiece with a fresh and refined sound. After dedicated and time consuming pre-production the \"New World Shadows\" album was an epic and massive attack of ever flowing stream of Finnish melodic death metal! The album was released in February 2011 and peaked on Finnish official album chart on position 5. and reached the position 1.(!) on Finnish Rumba indie shop chart. \"New World Shadows\" were again recorded by Teemu Aalto & mixed by Dan Swan\u00f6, who also provided some amazing clean vocals for the album. Band did two European tours after the release during 2011, first with Rotting Christ and second with Dark Tranquillity, Eluveitie, Mercenary etc. and two extended Finnish tour and big amount of festivals.\n\nThe \"NWS\" album is pure northern death metal without limitations - really melodic and intelligent but still aggressive and heavy as a really heavy thing, aside quoting feels from prog rock to even AOR - this is adult oriented death metal in it's most epic & purest form!\n\nThe next step of OG's saga is coming out early in 2013, so the story continues soooon!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SONiA disappear fear ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6774091.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Latin, Country, Singer Songwriter, Reggae, Middle Eastern Music, Americana, Acoustic Pop, Folk, Hebrew, Arabic, Alternative.

Ever since leaving wildly successful trip-hop group Sneaker Pimps, Corner\u2019s process of becoming IAMX beginning in 2004 has been theatrical, transcendent, and communal. Androgynous and visceral, IAMX has metamorphosed from small-town blue-collar kid to international pop star in the late 1990\u2019s to creator of raw art that disrupts gender and genre in the 2000\u2019s. Fueling electronic experimentation with punk energy and confessional lyricism, Corner\u2019s dark alternative electronic sound, fashion, performances, videos, and persona are larger than life, iconoclastic, and shockingly intimate.\n\n+++ I Forget That There\u2019s A World Outside +++\nGrowing up as a self-described socially anxious geek, Corner\u2019s interest in music was stoked by a \u201cweird uncle\u201d who would play \u201cstrange music\u201d to him. Interest became obsession, and obsession a means through which Corner explored his growing fascination with technology. The interest lingers to this day, as IAMX not only writes and performs, but also produces his own music. The awkward kid who spent a lot of time in his room became the iconoclastic artist who recently spent weeks in a converted homestead in the Mojave desert staring at mountains, mining the silence around him, fastidiously regenerating the muscle memory in his fingers, and practicing, and honing his new album, Echo Echo.\n\n+++ I've Seen Attention - See Through Me +++\nCorner\u2019s adolescent curiosity moved to a new level in his teens when he connected with his older sister\u2019s boyfriend Liam Howe, who became a friend and collaborator. Their first band F.R.I.S.K. released two bedroom-produced EPs \u2013 Soul of Indiscretion, World as a Cone \u2013 that provided an early sonic template for trip-hop in general. The pair also performed as DJs under the alias Line of Flight. In 1995, Corner and Howe formed Sneaker Pimps in Hartlepool, England with support from Kelli Dayton (vocals), Joe Wilson (bass) and Dave Westlake (drums). The newly formed band took rave culture and the pop charts by storm with their 1996 debut album, Becoming X which featured dance-floor classics \u201c6 Underground\u201d and \u201cSpin Spin Sugar\u201d, sold over a million copies, led to extensive touring, and attracted the attention of Virgin Records who signed them.\n\n+++ There\u2019s Something That\u2019s Stirring Deep In Me +++\nIn 1998 the band\u2019s changing creative direction lead to Corner taking over vocals from Kelli, and Splinter was released on Clean Up records in 1999. Splinter fostered a bourgeoning cult fandom, who continued with Sneaker Pimps through the band\u2019s third album Bloodsport (Tommy Boy) and beyond. Soon, Chris realised the band was no longer the right vehicle for where his music was headed, and from this awareness IAMX was born.\n\n+++ I Know You\u2019re Aching To Be Saved +++\nEven though some of the songs on IAMX\u2019s 2004 debut Kiss + Swallow were originally slated to be on the Sneaker Pimps' fourth album, (and IAMX is itself a reference to Becoming X), shades of Chris\u2019 old life quickly faded as his theatrical and gender-bending alias emerged with full force. From 2004 onward, IAMX maintained a hectic recording and touring schedule, moving to Berlin in 2005 at the peak of its electronic renaissance. IAMX released his sophomore album, The Alternative in 2006, followed in 2008 by Live In Warsaw. Kingdom Of Welcome Addiction and its anagram remix album Dogmatic Infidel Comedown OK followed in 2009 and 2010, chronicling a dark phase in Corner\u2019s life. As dark energy seductively does, it produced compelling work, including 2011\u2019s Volatile Times and 2013\u2019s The Unified Field albums, the latter of which is considered a milestone in IAMX\u2019s creative development as a musician and performer. Eventually, however, dark energy claims its toll.\n\n+++ The World Outside May Still Be Beautiful - But I Love This Cell +++\nFollowing a successful world tour in support of The Unified Field, Corner fell into a depressive and insomniac state. His ordeals \u2013 detailed in his personal blog here \u2013 prompted him to move to Los Angeles in sunny California for a change of scenery. \u201cI stopped listening to music for about a year. I stopped making music and it was almost unbearable to listen to music. For instance, I couldn\u2019t watch TV, I couldn\u2019t even drive as it would invoke these waves of existential panic, depression, and exhaustion. I thought I would never be able to make music again but that my enjoyment of it was over. That was a very scary idea,\u201d he explained.\n\n+++ In The Sunlight And The Dust Of California +++\nThe move was a good decision and yielded one of IAMX\u2019s best albums, Metanoia in 2015 and the mini-album Everything Is Burning (Metanoia Addendum) in 2016. Having poured his heart out lyrically on two successful albums and rigorous world tours, IAMX released Unfall (German for accident), an instrumental album to cleanse his creative palette. In 2017, Corner emerged from his depression into a state of euphoria captured on his album Alive In New Light.\n\n+++ The Boys With Their Toys Are Bringing The Void Our Way +++\nIn addition to his success as a songwriter, producer, and touring artist, IAMX is one of the most licensed musicians on ABC TV\u2019s runaway hit show, How To Get Away With Murder. By the beginning of 2019, IAMX had synced 16 of his songs to its soundtrack, becoming one of the most recognizable composers on television thanks to the show\u2019s creator Pete Nowalk being a super fan of IAMX. Another super fan turned collaborator is postmodern tattoo and makeup powerhouse, kindred spirit Kat Von D, who sang on four songs on Alive In New Light and shares IAMX\u2019s avant-garde fashion and design sense, epic stage theatricality, and gender-bending proclivities. IAMX\u2019s provocative aesthetics are not limited to his music and fashion. As a video artist, he crafts IAMX\u2019s stunning live visuals and most of their music videos, as well as videos for other acts, most notably his close friend Gary Numan.\n\n+++ Echoes From The Past +++\nIn the decompression from the electro-fueled passion that had taken IAMX to 27 countries on the Alive In New Light chapter, an old yearning reawakened. 2019 was to be the year that IAMX returned to the device that had been the initiation of his odyssey as a musician. The acoustic guitar. Eleven acoustic re-imaginings of IAMX\u2019s extensive catalogue, Echo Echo heralds the start of a new yet familiar tangent in the enthralling IAMX journey, one which promises the intimacy of his songwriting laid bare.\n\n+++ The Sky Has Opened Up And Now I\u2019m Overcome +++\nIAMX isn\u2019t clear where this newfound liberation will lead him. Rising from a humble working class background to capitalistic celebrity, then down to the depths of despair and back into a new light, IAMX\u2019s armor is now more permeable and his imagination more stimulated by Los Angeles\u2019 unrelenting optimism. For Chris Corner, turned IAMX, the transformative journey that began in his bedroom as a young kid in the North East of England and found its way into the California desert continues. The I AM in IAMX may imply stasis, a fixed state of being, but the X signifies the variable in mathematics and an unstoppable metamorphosis. IAMX will continue to evolve and is fiercely committed to deliver music that transcends genre, defies the rules of the music industry and cuts straight to the heart.", "otherInfo": "***LAST IAMX LIVE ONLINE SHOW***\nAccess: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/iamxacoustic-05-14\nChris performs IAMX songs live on acoustic guitar, vocal mic and various effect/loop pedals.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chris Bandi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7147175.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There are no tractors, trucks or tailgates here!

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Katie Kittermaster ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8840965.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Acoustic, Country, Pop", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Katie Kittermaster is a British singer/songwriter.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Andrina Bollinger ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371405.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Indie, Experimental, Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Andrina Bollinger, born 1991 in Zurich Switzerland, is a singer, performer, multiinstrumentalist and composer, mostly seen performing solo.

It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar.

It was a cozy place, filled with blue-collar workers who made their living on the water. During the weekends, many of those workers would head over to the Osborne household, where a series of loose, all-night jam sessions filled the Maryland air with the sounds of Bob Seger, Hank Williams, Tom Petty and George Jones. The Osborne siblings strummed their first chords during those jam sessions. From the very start, TJ Osborne was the brother with the voice. He sang in a thick, low baritone, crooning like Johnny Cash long before he was even old enough to drive. Older brother John, on the other hand, was the family\u2019s guitar shredder, his fingers capable of down-home bluegrass licks, arena-worthy rock riffs, country twang, and everything in between. Combined, the two Osbornes could play everything from traditional country music to rock & roll, creating a broad, full-bodied sound that would eventually fill the 11 songs on their major-label debut, Pawn Shop. Like its title suggests, Pawn Shop offers a little bit of everything. There\u2019s bluesy slide guitar, country duets, southern rock solos, harmonies, and plenty of groove. The hooks are big, the guitars are loud, and the songs \u2014 every last one of them co-written by the Osbornes, who reached out to award-winning songwriters like Shane McAnally and Ross Copperman for help \u2014 introduce a duo whose music bridges the gap between the mainstream and the alternative world. Some songs were written at home in Nashville, while others came together on the road, where the guys spent several years headlining their own club shows, touring the country with Darius Rucker, and playing some of the biggest arenas in America with fellow rule-breaker Eric Church. \u201cMost duos are built on singing,\u201d says TJ \u201cBut John is an incredible guitar player, and this band is built on me singing and John playing guitar. It gives us two parallels that work nicely together.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like an old-school rock approach,\u201d adds John, who cites classic bands like Aerosmith and the Allman Brothers as influences on the duo\u2019s dynamic. \u201cGroups like that always had the lead singer as well as the sideman guitar player. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going for, too. We\u2019re carving our own path in country music.\u201d That unique path has already led the band toward the upper half of the country charts. \u201cRum\u201d got them there first, mixing the feel-good sunshine of a beach tune with a far more realistic storyline. There\u2019s no actual beach in \u201cRum,\u201d after all. Instead, Brothers Osborne turn the song into a tribute to the simple pleasures that their Maryland hometown offers: friends, good weather, and the occasional drink. They even filmed the song\u2019s music video in Deale, filling the clip with footage of friends, relatives, and locals. \u201cMost people we grew up with don\u2019t go to these beautiful beaches,\u201d says TJ. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to do it. They don\u2019t have the time for it. What we\u2019re most familiar with is people going to the local bars and hanging out with each other.\u201d John adds, \u201cWe tried to have the biggest time possible with what little we had. \u2018Rum\u2019 explains that.\u201d The brothers agree, \u201cWe had to say it from our own perspective.\u201d A similar theme runs throughout \u201cDirt Rich\u201d and \u201cPawn Shop,\u201d two songs that stress the importance of appreciating what you\u2019ve got. Pawn Shop dishes up plenty of love songs, too, from \u201cLoving Me Back\u201d \u2014 an old-school country duet featuring vocals from Lee Ann Womack \u2014 to \u201cStay a Little Longer,\u201d the band\u2019s biggest hit to date. While a three-minute guitar solo brings \u201cStay a Little Longer\u201d to an epic, anthemic close, Brothers Osborne also devote time to more laid-back songs, from the nostalgic California country of \u201c21 Summer\u201d to the 420-friendly \u201cGreener Pastures.\u201d Brothers Osborne, who co-produced the album with Jay Joyce (the award-winning producer behind Little Big Town\u2019s Painkiller, Eric Church\u2019s The Outsiders, and Carrie Underwood\u2019s Storyteller), recorded most of Pawn Shop during breaks in their busy touring schedule, using members of their own touring band rather than session musicians from the Nashville community. The result is an album that\u2019s stamped with the unmistakable mark of a band. It doesn\u2019t sound like two singers, flanked by anonymous players. Instead, it sounds like a group of road warriors who\u2019ve spent years sharing bus seats and hotel rooms, creating the sort of chemistry that can\u2019t be faked. Pawn Shop is both raw and real, and Brothers Osborne \u2014 who, years after those household jam sessions in Deale, now have a handful of nationwide tours under their belts, songs on the charts, and a career on the rise \u2014 are no longer a family secret.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dears ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10278828.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Alternative, Art Rock, Indie Rock, Prog-rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Dears, a critically acclaimed \u201corchestral-pop-noir-romantique\u201d rock'n'roll band from Montre?al, is shaped equally by nineties rock and a broad tableau of gospel, soul, and pop music.\n\nThe band formed in 1995 and released their first album, End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story, in 2000.

The title is not arbitrarily applied. His first major musical success was in 2012 with a trapped-out remix of Hardstyle superstar Showtek\u2019s \u201cF.T.S.\u201d This tune, which SAYMYNAME credits as the impetus for the Hardtrap genre, was banged out ad infinitum on every major festival stage in the world multiple times over. LA Weekly has also acknowledged this title. By fusing Hardstyle with Trap, \u201cthe dance music world has been better for it ever since\u201d. But this Humboldt, California native had modest beginnings. SAYMYNAME was raised in a musical family. By the age of 5, his father, a DJ himself, cultivated in Dayve a passion for music. At 12, he picked up DJing as a hobby. His high school years were punctuated by his interest in music, sports, and the arts (Dayvid is an accomplished Graffiti and street artist). He took two years of advanced music theory courses, which set him on the path to professional music production. He first experimented with Apple\u2019s Garage Band but soon graduated to more advanced production tools like Acid, Reason, Sylenth and Abelton. He was accepted to Chapman University in Orange County, California, the prestigious IVY league of the West Coast. While there he kept himself as focused on music as he did on his academics and, in 2013, his diligent work ethic and production prowess combined to win him the coveted Insomniac Discovery Project contest. This win landed him squarely in front of thousands of fans at EDC Las Vegas, and his performance was touted as one of the best of the festival. His future in dance music was becoming a reality, but this dream had yet to pay the bills. After college, Dayve continued to work 35-40 hours a week at Guitar Center, then rushed home to produce in his bedroom at night. It was this job at Guitar Center that got him through those tough early days, and two days before his first Australia tour, he handed in his two weeks. Now, years later, with top headline and mainstage billings across the globe and mega hits like his collaboration with Mercer, \u201cWanted\u201d, and his remixes of Dj Snake\u2019s \u201cPropoganda\u201d and Mercer\u2019s \u201cEncore\u201d, SAYMYNAME finds himself at the center of setlists by Dance music\u2019s elite including Tiesto, Afrojack, David Guetta, Dillon Francis, Madeon, Dimitri Vegas Like Mike, Jauz, W&W, DYRO, Borgeous, Showtek, NGHTMRE, and Diplo. Towering above the decks at 6\u20195, SAYMYNAME is the undisputed champion and originator of Hardtrap.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Built to Spill ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371631.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Built to Spill plays the songs of Daniel Johnston out this MAY.

It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eastport Oyster Boys ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10058846.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Celtic, Boogie-woogie, Folk Rock, Indie Maritime Music Heroes", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Proclaimed the Musical Goodwill Ambassadors for the City of Annapolis, the Maritime Republic of Eastport and the Chesapeake... the Oyster Boys have traveled internationally spreading the cheer and the joys of life by the waters of the Chesapeake Bay...", "otherInfo": "Grab a beverage of choice and join us boys for a fun and music filled VIRTUAL SUNSET CRUISE ON SCHOONER WOODWIND...

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Grouplove ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9934479.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Alternative, Contemporary Classics, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "It starts like an alarm. 'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dears ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10278828.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Alternative, Art Rock, Indie Rock, Prog-rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Dears, a critically acclaimed \u201corchestral-pop-noir-romantique\u201d rock'n'roll band from Montre?al, is shaped equally by nineties rock and a broad tableau of gospel, soul, and pop music.\n\nThe band formed in 1995 and released their first album, End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story, in 2000.

Their platinum-selling record, Through the Fire and Flames, brought them international acclaim and was featured as the most-challenging song on Guitar Hero III. Their energetic and humorous live performances have won them fans on every continent.\n\nThe group is known for their long, complex and fast guitar solos performed by Herman Li and Sam Totman, who founded the band after meeting through a classified ad in 1999. Since then, the band has released eight studio albums, including Valley of the Damned (2003), Sonic Firestorm (2004), Inhuman Rampage (2006), Ultra Beatdown (2008), The Power Within (2012), Maximum Overload (2014), and Reaching into Infinity (2017). Drawing from a wide range of influences, the band\u2019s sound combines the sing-a-long choruses of classic 80's rock with triumphant, uplifting melodies and fantasy-themed power-metal-inspired lyrics. As a nod to their passion for all things video-game related, the band frequently incorporates retro game sounds and melodies into their recordings and live shows.\n\nDragonForce's new album, Extreme Power Metal, was released on September 27th, 2019. The album was produced in Los Angeles, California by Damien Rainaud at Mix Unlimited. The band also recorded parts of the album on Herman Li's livestream channel on Twitch (www.twitch.tv/hermanli) with participation from the fans. Li says, \"This album again combines the best of DragonForce in an even bigger, more epic way than we have ever done before. We are so excited for fans to hear it!\" Following the departure of Vadim Pruzhanov from the band last year, the keyboards of this new album was performed by Coen Janssen of symphonic metal titan Epica, bringing a new dimension into a DragonForce album. Totman says, \"We worked really closely with Coen on this new album. We are so happy with what he has brought into this new album. Every fan will be so happy to hear his majestic playing!\"\n\nDragonForce started a world tour right on the release day of Extreme Power Metal.

The title is not arbitrarily applied. His first major musical success was in 2012 with a trapped-out remix of Hardstyle superstar Showtek\u2019s \u201cF.T.S.\u201d This tune, which SAYMYNAME credits as the impetus for the Hardtrap genre, was banged out ad infinitum on every major festival stage in the world multiple times over. LA Weekly has also acknowledged this title. By fusing Hardstyle with Trap, \u201cthe dance music world has been better for it ever since\u201d. But this Humboldt, California native had modest beginnings. SAYMYNAME was raised in a musical family. By the age of 5, his father, a DJ himself, cultivated in Dayve a passion for music. At 12, he picked up DJing as a hobby. His high school years were punctuated by his interest in music, sports, and the arts (Dayvid is an accomplished Graffiti and street artist). He took two years of advanced music theory courses, which set him on the path to professional music production. He first experimented with Apple\u2019s Garage Band but soon graduated to more advanced production tools like Acid, Reason, Sylenth and Abelton. He was accepted to Chapman University in Orange County, California, the prestigious IVY league of the West Coast. While there he kept himself as focused on music as he did on his academics and, in 2013, his diligent work ethic and production prowess combined to win him the coveted Insomniac Discovery Project contest. This win landed him squarely in front of thousands of fans at EDC Las Vegas, and his performance was touted as one of the best of the festival. His future in dance music was becoming a reality, but this dream had yet to pay the bills. After college, Dayve continued to work 35-40 hours a week at Guitar Center, then rushed home to produce in his bedroom at night. It was this job at Guitar Center that got him through those tough early days, and two days before his first Australia tour, he handed in his two weeks. Now, years later, with top headline and mainstage billings across the globe and mega hits like his collaboration with Mercer, \u201cWanted\u201d, and his remixes of Dj Snake\u2019s \u201cPropoganda\u201d and Mercer\u2019s \u201cEncore\u201d, SAYMYNAME finds himself at the center of setlists by Dance music\u2019s elite including Tiesto, Afrojack, David Guetta, Dillon Francis, Madeon, Dimitri Vegas Like Mike, Jauz, W&W, DYRO, Borgeous, Showtek, NGHTMRE, and Diplo.

With her latest EP Black Roses, Alex has added an electric edge to her acoustic singer/songwriter persona, resulting in a more blunt sound akin to Evanescence and Grace Potter, with a touch of Heart. The new record has a distinctly rock feel that brings a new dimension to her heartfelt songs without alienating longtime fans of Alex's introspective compositions. Her stories of heartbreak, inner turmoil, and life's complications are now told from the perspective of a woman with more edge, a dreamer who has walked a few more miles down her own road.\n\nWhether performing solo, duo, or with a full band, Alex brings a fun yet sophisticated ambiance to her live performances.

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fruition ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10378906.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Soul, Folk-rock, Rock, Americana", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The first time they ever made music together, Fruition\u2019s three lead singer/songwriters discovered that their voices naturally blended into stunning three-part harmony. Eight years after that impromptu busking session, the Portland, Oregon-based quintet has grown from a rootsy, string-centric outfit to a full-fledged rock band with an easy but powerful grasp of soul, blues, and British Invasion era pop. On their new album Labor of Love, Fruition shows the complete force of their newly expanded and electrified sound, matching their more daring musicality with sophisticated, melody-minded songcraft. With Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja trading vocal duties and offering up their own singular brand of gutsy yet graceful songwriting, Fruition infuse each track on Labor of Love with timeless urgency and three-part harmonies that never fail to enthrall.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2013 album Just One of Them Nights, Labor of Love came to life over the course of a year-long process of exploring new sonic terrain that included everything from Phil Spector-esque pop to dreamy psychedelia to Motown-inspired soul. \u201cIn the past our approach was always to just get in the studio and get it done, but for this one we decided we were going to take all the time in the world to make the album great,\u201d says Anderson. Teaming up with engineer Justin Phelps (Amanda Palmer, Jolie Holland, Chuck Prophet), Fruition self-produced Labor of Love and mined major inspiration from the inventive precision of longtime Beatles producer George Martin. \u201cThis is the first album where we made a point of bringing out the character of each song to the fullest,\u201d says Thompson, who helmed the mixing of the album. \u201cWith our previous albums we tended to treat each song the same, but this time we really went all the way with whatever sound we were going for.\u201d\n\nDespite pushing into so many disparate directions, Labor of Love emerges as a wholly unified album that subtly imparts the sense of being swept along on a journey. That unity\u2019s got much to do with an open-hearted spirit that sets in from the first notes of the dobro, mandolin and electric guitar driven title track, carries on to the sleepy soul of \u201cSanta Fe,\u201d then unfolds into the beautifully epic balladry of \u201cThe Meaning.\u201d Another key factor in the album\u2019s journey-like feel: Fruition\u2019s ingenious use of between-song transitions, such as the Brazilian-style percussion that lifts Labor of Love from the breezy R&B of \u201cAbove the Line\u201d to the joyful worldbeat-folk of \u201cThe Way That I Do.\u201d \u201cWe brought in a local band called Tapwater one night and enlisted their samba line,\u201d recalls Asebroek. \u201cThey taught us all the drum parts and about ten of us formed a whole drumline, which was just a really fun and unique experience for the band.\u201d\n\nThough Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja each bring a distinct sensibility and boldly nuanced lyricism to their respective songs, a mood of warm melancholy instills much of Labor of Love. \u201cA common theme for all three songwriters is trying to embrace being out on the road all the time, but also feeling like you\u2019re missing out on the everyday lifestyle that most people get to have,\u201d says Leonard. Embedded within that tension is a wistful romanticism that imbues many of the album\u2019s songs. \u201cMost of the love songs are very much about those rare moments of getting to be with the people you love,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cAnd then other songs are about coming back to the people you love, and trying to deal with the strange ways things change because of being apart.\u201d The band chose Labor of Love\u2019s title to reflect that balance of sacrifice and satisfaction, Naja points out. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep nearly enough and we\u2019re away all the time and we do work really hard,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s our job, and it\u2019s pretty much the best job in the world.\u201d\n\nAll near-lifelong musicians, the members of Fruition came to Portland from varied corners of the country and gradually crossed paths by way of their adopted hometown\u2019s music scene. \u201cMimi and Kellen were going to busk one day and I went along with them, \u2018cause that\u2019s what we always did to pay for that night\u2019s dinner and drinks,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cSo we started playing and just instantly nailed these three-part harmonies, to the point where we\u2019d get done with a song and burst out laughing at how good it sounded.\u201d The magic of those harmonies ended up proving instrumental in rounding out the rest of the band. \u201cThe first time I ever played with them, we were jamming in a friend\u2019s attic and the harmonies surrounded me,\u201d says Thompson, who joined Fruition in 2011. \u201cI had goosebumps for an hour afterward, and I decided right then I was quitting my other band and moving to Portland.\u201d Releasing their debut EP Hawthorne Hoedown in 2008, Fruition devoted the coming years to relentlessly writing and performing, The band moved from busking on the street, to scraping their way onto the lower levels of festival lineups, to opening tours for bands like ALO and Greensky Bluegrass and onward to being invited to play bigger festivals with ever bigger billing on those lineups. Last year saw them appear at Bonnaroo, Northwest String Summit and Telluride Bluegrass where Rolling Stone cited their artful choice of covers and \u201craucous originals filled with heartfelt lyrics and stadium-worthy energy.\u201d This year will see them share a Red Rocks bill with JJ Grey and Mofro and The Infamous Stringdusters, along with a full headline tour of the United States.\n\nThat breadth of touring experience has steadily reshaped the band and ultimately allowed them to achieve a sound they\u2019ve long aspired toward. \u201cA few of the songs on the new album actually came from years ago, in an era when we were much more of a string band,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019d imagined the songs in a particular way but didn\u2019t have the ability or experience to get them where we wanted to be\u2014we didn\u2019t even own the right instruments.\u201d But despite broadening their repertoire, a certain spirited simplicity still forms the heart of Fruition. \u201cWe all tend to write on acoustic guitar and let things start in the same stripped-down, folky sort of way that we always did,\u201d says Naja. \u201cSo where the songs come from hasn\u2019t really changed much at all. What\u2019s different is where we let them go from there.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Moe ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "VIRTUAL: John Moe with Sean Doolittle and Linda Holmes"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ming ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10366117.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Tech House, Tribal House, Electro House, Deep House, House, Electronica, Progressive House", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When it comes to change, you either get on board or get left behind.

Justin Fabus tells a story worthy of this time-honored and timeless tradition. In his music, the singer and songwriter exudes a raw relatability between the resounding twang of acoustic guitar and robust rhythms. Endorsed by everyone from Taste of Country to The Boot and handpicked by Donnie Wahlberg to open New Kids on the Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour in his native Pittsburgh, the troubadour transforms trials and tribulations into country anthems.\n\u201cI\u2019m from a dog-eat-dog place that\u2019s very hard to break out of,\u201d he admits. \u201cHowever, my philosophy is, \u2018If you\u2019re not going to let me through the front door, I\u2019m going to climb through the window\u2019. Pittsburgh\u2019s a blue-collar hardworking town; I write blue-collar songs. That\u2019s country music at its core. That\u2019s who I am.\u201d\nHe also continues to make major strides through simply doing what he does. 2016\u2019s self-titled Justin Fabus soared to the Top 3 of iTunes Top Country Albums chart as he performed with everyone from Garry Allan and Randy Houser to Craig Campbell. In addition to sold out headline gigs, the 2017 CMA Music Festival showcased him as an \u201cEmerging Artist.\u201d However, he reached new heights with Remedy in 2018. Boasting collaborations with Joey Henry [Frank Sinatra, John Denver, Garth Brooks] and The Voice star Tony Lucca, it crashed the Billboard New Country Albums Chart in the Top 50. Not to mention, he landed features from Paste, AXS, All Access, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and many others.\nIn the midst of this rapid rise, Justin faced a turbulent and trying time. His mother passed away after a bout with pancreatic cancer.\n\u201cIt was definitely a rough year,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMy mom was the main reason I got into music. She was always my number one fan. It took a toll on me. I was lost. After a month, I snapped out of it, because music is all I know. I put my best foot forward.\u201d\nIn January 2019, he got a little encouragement from a legend. Tweeting about how \u201cthere needed to be a country version of New Kids on the Block\u2019s \u20182 in the Morning\u2019,\u201d Donnie replied with his blessing. So, Justin recorded his take on the tune from 2008\u2019s chart-topping, The Block. The cover caught fire online and Donnie personally invited Justin to perform it at PPG Paints Arena in front of 20,000 screaming fans when New Kids On The Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour rolled through Pittsburgh in 2019.\nIn the aftermath, Justin launched his biggest solo headline run to date the Back From Hell Tour, crisscrossing the country and packing houses. However, everything set the stage for his next original body of work.\nStripping down the sound to guitar, drums, and bass as the backdrop for the same catchy and confessional storytelling, Justin ultimately adds a new edge to country by preserving its integrity.\n\u201cI want people to listen to it and feel the pain and realness of my songs,\u201d he leaves. \u201cI\u2019m never going to write songs I didn\u2019t live or haven\u2019t gone through. My style keeps progressing and growing. I\u2019m writing about loss, but I\u2019m also writing about falling in love.

Kenneth\u2019s musical styling and dynamic live performances also attracted the attention of some of his mentors like Lucinda Williams, Billy Gibbons and current bandmate Steve Ferrone of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Since 2013, he spent two years touring with multi-Grammy winner Lucinda Williams, who describes the sound of the live band as \u201csomewhere between Lynyrd Skynyrd and Drive-By Truckers\u201d. He has also opened for ZZ Top, Steve Winwood, and Blackberry Smoke. Whether in intimate Honky Tonks or stately, sold-out theaters, Kenneth and the live band continue to captivate audiences with powerful, resonating guitar tones and a tight rhythm section.\n\nKenneth\u2019s sixth studio album \u2018With Lions,\u2019 released May 19th 2017, includes 11 songs all written by Kenneth and pays tribute to his mentors as well as his musically rich and culturally significant Southern heritage. The single \u201cYou\u2019re Not Mine\u201d is an edgy anthem with heavy-hitting guitar solos and powerful vocals. \u201cBeautiful Storm\u201d is an emotionally evocative track that showcases Kenneth\u2019s spell-binding competency with a slide.\n\nRock \u2018n\u2019 roll royalty Steve Ferrone (Drums, Tambourine, Shakers) and Scott Thurston (Keyboards, Piano) of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers don\u2019t just lend their talents for the album but, Ferrone sits behind the drum kit when he\u2019s not touring with Tom Petty. Kenneth and Steve met a couple of years ago at a gathering thrown by a mutual pal. Not long after, he needed a drummer for a Hollywood gig and Steve sat in with the band. He has worked with Kenneth to hone the sound and helped him the right players. And as they say, the rest is history. Handpicked by Steve, drummer Chris Cano plays with the KBB when Ferrone is on the road with the Heartbreakers. Popular session bass guitarist and Disresputable Few member, Paul Ill, joined the band at Steve\u2019s urging and perfectly rounded out the Kenneth Brian Band sound. \u201cThose two were the perfect combination for what I do,\u201d said Kenneth. \u201cTheir influence has helped elevate my playing and just being around Steve is a master class on how to be a successful artist and a decent human being,\u201d he continued. In true KBB form, the sound of the new album honors a distinctive blend of Southern Rock that is both progressive and rooted in tradition.\n\nWhile Kenneth currently resides in Los Angeles, he originally hails from the South. Born in Virginia, he spent some of his formative years in Alabama before his family settled in the musically rich town of Gainesville, Florida. From a very young age, he realized his passion for creating music and has pursued it with vigor. He penned his first country song on an old guitar at the ripe age of 4 and became serious about the guitar at age 11.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville in 2001, Kenneth hit the road with a new sound steeped in tradition.\n\n\u2018With Lions,\u2019 out May 19, 2017 on Robo Records, was recorded at Dave\u2019s Room Studio in Hollywood, California.

His live performances have been honed over a decade of being on the road performing more than 200 shows each year. Elliott is lauded as \u201cIowa\u2019s Renaissance man\u201d by Culture Buzz Magazine. He has penned more than 1,500 songs in his career while also cultivating his skills as a painter, sculptor, illustrator and author (Wilderman\u2019s Treetop Tales; Rumble & Flash).\n\n\u201cThat man\u2019s music is as honest as was Woody Guthrie\u2019s.\u201d - Atesh Sonneborn, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings\n\nElliott\u2019s early career demonstrates a love of folk, roots and singer-songwriter music. He has worked with many greats and shared the stage with artists of the highest caliber, including Odetta, Tom Paxton, Loudon Wainwright III, R.L. Burnside, Ruthie Foster, Jimmie Vaughan, Greg Brown, Bo Ramsey, etc.\n\nOn his 20th album, Wreck and Ruin, Elliott dove into his love of roots-rock, soul and blues music with a rocking band behind his artfully crafted songs. Producer and drummer, Ken Coomer (Wilco, Uncle Tupelo) lined up the best rhythm and lead players in Nashville to create Elliott\u2019s greatest album to date. Guitarist and bassist Kenny Vaughan and Dave Roe, legendary Nashville players, add the needed touches to rocket Elliott\u2019s songs into a new arena of hard driving Americana.\n\n\u201cChad Elliott has assembled not only a great group of songs, but some of Nashville's finest roots music practitioners and producer drummer Ken Coomer to make a soulful and beautiful album. Townes would be proud.\u201d - Will Kimbrough about Wreck and Ruin\n\nOn his 21st album, RINGGOLD, Elliott recorded songs at his home studio in Iowa. The studio, built in his grandparents\u2019 former home, helped him connect with his roots and explore difficult songs about those closest to him. It was released in 2017.\n\nToday, with his band The Redemptions, there is a marked shift in his sound that is entirely original. Elliott released his 22nd album, Rest Heavy: The Sun Studio Sessions, in 2018. Greg Brown said of the new album, it\u2019s \u201clow, loose and full of juice. This album\u2019s got a lot of life to it.\u201d\n\nWith Rest Heavy, Elliott shows his love of roots-rock, soul, and blues music with a rocking band behind his artfully crafted songs and gravelly delivery. Elliott, performing on acoustic guitar and harmonica, is joined by his full band, The Redemptions, including Tommy Lewis, Travis McFarlane, Kevin Boehnke, Joseph Cafaro, and Jim Van Dorn. The self-produced album was recorded at the famed Sun Studio in Memphis, TN by Ples Hampton. Hampton said, \u201cIt was honestly one of the best sessions I've ever had up here. This is gold.\u201d\n\nIn November 2019 Elliott released a new album, King Pelican. This album holds 8 tracks recorded live with his band, The Redemptions, during a set for The Sun Studio Sessions documentary series featured on PBS. The show is currently airing nationwide. The entire album delivers the goods. It is a colorful album including songs such as the title track, a fun New Orleans-style number about a ne'er-do-well character, and \"Paris,\" which would make Humphrey Bogart shed a tear.

With a voice that touches somewhere deep inside, Alyssa\u2019s soulful sound and powerful lyrics will send you jet-setting into a broad range of human emotions. Growing up on the open roads of America, with her RCA country recording artists parents, Baillie & The Boys, made it impossible for Alyssa not to witness the power and magic of music. At just 3 weeks old, her cradle was the gentle rocking of a tour bus. Her play ground encompassed sound checks at fairs and festivals and back stage dressing rooms at a slew of different venues including the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Award shows, and her \u201cextended family\u201d consisted of managers, promoters, roadies, musicians and other fellow mainstream country artists.\n\nAt the age of 3, Alyssa performed on the Ralph Emory television show, Nashville Now. Where her version of the Leslie Gore classic; It\u2019s My Party brought the house down in front of millions of national viewers. At age 10, one of those major acts, Kenny Rogers, decided Alyssa was the perfect child singer to record a duet with him on his Christmas CD, Christmas From The Heart. By age 13, Alyssa had her first batch of songs written and received an endorsement from Gretsch Guitars. She had figured out her own unique style of guitar playing with open tunings inspired by Joni Mitchell. By age 16 she landed her first 50 date tour opening up for Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives. It soon became obvious that she was the real deal, not only as a musician and singer but as a prolific songwriter as well.\n\nWhile in high-school, Alyssa became a go-to session singer for people like Christian artist Matt Maher, where she created her own layered harmony vocal approach from years of hearing her parents sing together. Her songs started finding their way into television shows, (Switched! on ABC Family, MTV), movies, as well as getting her first cuts on other artists projects.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Alyssa received a full scholarship from Sennheiser to Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts in Liverpool England, where she would spend the next three years earning a degree in Sound Technology while continuing to perform in local venues throughout Europe. While playing at a venue called The Zanzibar in Liverpool, Alyssa was spotted by Liverpool Rock Star Pete Wylie and was asked to join his band playing electric guitar and singing background vocals. Alyssa of course said yes, and experienced what most artists never experience; a private performance requested by the Queen to help support one of Liverpool\u2019s local charities. A performance with Ringo Starr at the 800th Anniversary of Liverpool\u2019s, \u201cCapital Of Culture 2008\u201d event; a performance slot at one of the UK\u2019s largest music festivals; Knowsley Hall on the same bill as The Who, and from there on scored her own slots performing on the Acoustic stage at Glastonbury in 2009, and a UK tour opening for Raul Malo of The Mavericks.\n\nWhile at LIPA, Alyssa was inspired by their music community and the extreme amount of talented people attending the school. She lived in Lennon Studios, an apartment complex that used to be the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Her incredibly unique experiences abroad inspired her debut album, The English Diaries, an all acoustic intimate collection of songs she produced and recorded herself in her one bedroom Beatles inspired flat.\n\nAfter graduating LIPA and receiving her diploma from Paul McCartney himself, Alyssa returned to Nashville and signed her first publishing deal with Rondor Music. While signed to Rondor, she produced and released her sophomore album Love Hard which was backed by a 10k dollar Kickstarter Campaign and landed one of the biggest nationwide commercial placements of 2012 with her song, \u201cI Make My Own Sunshine,\u201d inspired by Liverpool\u2019s rainy weather. It was featured in a Lowe\u2019s commercial, earning over 50,000 downloads in its first 3 months and over 1 million plays on Spotify. She had no idea at the time that her song would later be heard by Steven Tyler and recorded on his first ever solo album, We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere and that she would be the only solo writer on his debut #1 billboard Country album.\n\nAlyssa\u2019s many other accomplishments in the singer/songwriter community include: Writing with Jeffrey Steele, Michelle Branch, Hunter Hayes, and JD Souther, writing three songs on Jessie James Decker\u2019s top 5 Billboard Country album \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d and co-writing top 40 billboard country radio single, \u201cLights Down Low\u201d, winning Canadian songwriter of the year and song of the year for \u201cI Only Smoke When I Drink\u201d by the Small Town Pistols, co-writing Jana Kramer\u2019s latest country radio single \u201cCircles\u201d and a #17 AC Billboard Chart Christmas duet with Matthew & Gunner Nelson called \u201cThis Christmas\u201d which she wrote with the twins and her father, Michael Bonagura. She\u2019s also had three #1 hits in Australia with Morgan Evans and Chelsea Basham and produced music for Jo Dee Messina & Rachel Reinert of Gloriana.\n\nAt 28 years old, Alyssa has become a songwriting seamstress for a number of artists, a producer, and a band member of the west coast folk & classic rock n\u2019 roll sounds of The Sisterhood Band with friend Ruby Stewart, all while simultaneously having a career as a solo artist. She\u2019s created life long friendships with fellow songwriters, artists and musicians, and has been called \u201cA fixture on Nashville\u2019s indie singer-songwriter scene\u201d by Rolling Stone. It\u2019s been over 4 years since she\u2019s released a solo project, but when you hear her newest record Road Less Traveled, you\u2019ll know it was worth the wait.\n\nAfter an entire summer of recording plans with an outside producer had fallen through, Alyssa turned to her boyfriend Graham Whitford for guidance on what was the best way forward for the songs she so much believed in. They decided to call long time friend and engineer Mark Petaccia to see if he was available to help record at his studio Petti Sound in Berry Hill. By a simple twist of fate, he had 7 days free.\n\nHer closest friends and family who are all a part of the Nashville underground music community decided to come together and help her create Road Less Traveled without the help of a label and purely for the love and support of their friend. The entire album was recorded live, produced by Alyssa & Mark Petaccia, Mastered by Richard Dodd and executive produced by Karen Whitford. Alyssa showcases her multi-instrumental talents by playing acoustic guitar in her signature open tunings, Piano, Ukulele, Lap Steel, Electric guitar, Bass, B3 and Harmonica. She\u2019s backed by Graham Whitford, Caleb Crosby, and Noah Denney (3/4ths of Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown), String arrangers and players Eleonore Denig and Molly Cherryholmes (Mountain Heart), Kevin McGowan, Tarka Layman, fellow artist and songwriter Davis Naish, and her father Michael Bonagura on Electric guitar.\n\nRoad Less Traveled showcases Alyssa as a solo artist in her truest form to date and shares the journey of finding her own voice and paving her own path as an independent Country artist. It encompasses elements of early Sheryl Crow mixed with Joni Mitchell like vocals. You'll hear so many iconic female influences on this project. Alyssa blends them all extremely well to come up with a sound that is familiar in its harkening back to the greats from multiple decades, yet completely unique and unlike anything else one would hear today. Road Less Traveled comes out for pre-order 8.19.16 and will be available 9.23.16.", "otherInfo": "Alyssa will be streaming from IG Live on Vox's instagram for their MiniSessions series!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sean Doolittle ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "VIRTUAL: John Moe with Sean Doolittle and Linda Holmes"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Craig Cardiff ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10378447.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Indie, Folk, Traditional, Singer-songwriter, Acoustic, Roots", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Canadian Singer-Songwriter\n100+ million streams\n100% fan powered\n\nCANADA: brandhawa@apa-agency.com\nUS: domenique@ecgnyc.com\n\nMGMT - tom@ecgnyc.com", "otherInfo": "Please follow on instagram for live stream concert updates.\n\n\n\neveryday 7pm - 7:30pm where bring the songs to you for singalonging.\n\n\n\nplease follow on all the regular social media and such.\n\n\n\nRemember:\n\nbe honest, silly and kind. avoid mischief and jealousy.\n\n\n\nbe gentle with yourself. be gentle with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider supporting the music / team on patreon.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/craigcardiff"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Steve Guyger ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Red Molly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8023194.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Roots, Folk, Country, Americana, Bluegrass", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The dynamic female trio that began as a happy accident around a campsite (at the 2004 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival) is now drawing invitations from renowned historic national events like Merlefest, and is winning over audiences around the country.

With a 2020 PEI Music nomination for Rock Recording of the Year and 5 single releases from their album A Minor Conspiracy, the band has burst onto the indie music scene with their debut LP. They have been featured on CBC's Mainstreet with Matt Rainnie, Q93, CBC Music Hour with Bill Roach, The East Coast Countdown, Q104 in Halifax, CJIM Montreal's Rock Station New Scotland Radio, CIOE FM's \"Fresh From the East\" & \"East Coast Rising\", and shared the stage with Canadian icons Big Wreck, The Road Hammers, Honeymoon Suite & Haywire during one of PEI\u201ds biggest festivals, Rock The Boat. In 2019 their single Like Water made CBC Searchlight\u2019s Top 100 by fan vote.?\n\nWhen founding members, husband & wife duo Karen & Mike Penton, first met in 2001, she didn't know he was a performing musician and he didn't know she had a secret life long desire to be one. To Karen\u2019s delight, their second date consisted of 2 bottles of wine and an acoustic guitar \u2013 the deal was sealed. After a few years of signing Beatles\u2019 covers (and other classics) together at home, Mike decided it was time to push Karen into the spotlight. With their mutual passion for music and newly formed partnership, the two went on to create several popular cover bands (Junkmale, Pretty Tragic, No Doubt & Alanis Morissette tribute show, Karen & Mike acoustic duo), performing all over PEI and into NB, before forming Soul Filter in 2017.?\n\nThe two had dabbled in songwriting individually since they were teenagers but put it on the back burner while they raised their two girls and performed in cover bands on the weekends. What started out as a fun hobby became a purpose and life force. After years of singing other people's songs, an increasing passion to find and sing her own words, and a gnawing desire to see what kind of magic they would create together helped push Karen & Mike to write and record A Minor Conspiracy.\n\nWith themes of self-discovery, adversity, love and loss, the album infuses pop, blues and folk into Soul Filter's rock roots sound. Acoustic rhythm serves as the backbone to melodically sweet electric guitar riffs and punchy choruses. Baring a reminiscent feel to the 90's alternative contemporary rock era, lead singer/songwriter Karen gets her musical inspiration from artists like The Cranberries, Alanis Morissette, & Sheryl Crow. Dynamically weaving between soft falsetto and soulful, powerful vocals, Karen embraces vulnerability and delivers empowering, self-reflective lyrics through alluringly catchy melodies. To bring the album to life on stage, Karen & Mike brought in longtime friends and former cover band mates Ronnie Arsenault on bass guitar, and Marc Robichaud on drums.\n\nThe band has been busy performing and promoting their album across PEI and looks forward to bringing their live stage performance on road.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clay Whittington ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10374923.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Jazz, Rock, Country, Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "An accomplished vocalist and pianist, Clay Whittington is an energetic, passionate entertainer who delivers an unrivaled solo performance.

Also known for their phenomenal live show, the Nashville-based duo are now gearing up to make their Rounder debut with a sophomore album showcasing their boundless energy and tremendous generosity as songwriters and performers.\n\nDespite the deep sense of communion that infuses their music, Michael and Tanya hail from wildly different backgrounds. Originally from just outside Washington, D.C., Tanya discovered her supreme vocal skills at a young age and promptly pursued a career in music and acting. Meanwhile, Michael grew up in Cleveland and D.C., spending part of his childhood in homeless shelters and later enlisting in the U.S. Army. While stationed in one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s palaces several years after 9/11, he gained access to a piano and quickly captivated his fellow troops with his powerful vocal presence. Soon tasked with writing and performing songs in memoriam to his unit\u2019s fallen soldiers, Michael cultivated a distinct songwriting voice that he further developed upon returning home. After he and Tanya shared the stage at a music festival, the two began creating music together, eventually marrying and forming The War And Treaty. Their EP Down to the River arrived in July 2017, and the duo made their full-length debut with Healing Tide\u2014a widely acclaimed effort. The Associated Press called them, \u201c\u2026a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together,\u201d while Billboard went on to claim that, \u201cThe music world\u2026has definitely shown that it\u2019s ready to love The War and Treaty.\u201d\n\nThe War And Treaty have shared two new tracks from their forthcoming album that bring even more depth and dimension to their music.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brandon Goldberg ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Will Dailey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7763884.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Artist, Singer Songwriter...

This seeker of the life-changing novel and the perfect pair of beat-to-hell boots; this connoisseur of the cool classic movie and the greasiest dive-bar cheeseburger, disciple of the museum\u2019s masterpiece and the panhandler\u2019s wiliest street-pitch? This guy who lives it, loves it, takes it all in and pours out something so tight and right you just gotta hear it again and again? Well, let\u2019s just tell it straight: Rick Brantley is a singer-songwriter who can seriously, seriously write and sing; a rocker who can really, truly rock. A young man worth listening to. Rick Brantley was born and raised in the musical mecca of Macon, Georgia, a preacher\u2019s son, soaking up the strains of gospel music, fire-and-brimstone sermons and the echoes of musical legends: Blind Willie McTell, Otis Redding, The Allman Brothers. \u201cMy Dad dug the local heroes, and was big on pop/rock hitmakers of the 70\u2019s, too, like Three Dog Night. We had a little home recording studio; music was such a part of everything\u201d, Rick says. He was also inspired by singer-songwriters like Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. \u201cYou learn from those guys and they lead you to Kristofferson, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt,\u201d he adds. Brantley learned his lessons well: barely out of high school, his own songs and red-hot band performances led to a publishing contract and new home base in Nashville. Since then, his songs have been covered by artists ranging from Meat Loaf to country crooner David Nail, while he\u2019s continued honing his stage chops as both full-tilt rock-show frontman and acoustic solo performer, opening for acts as diverse as John Hiatt, Zac Brown Band, Better Than Ezra, and Steve Earle. It\u2019s the rock side that takes the wheel for Brantley\u2019s newest EP, Hi-Fi. The six-track musical meal leans into the wind, pairing his rock howl with hope and harmonica. Beginning with \u201cFine So Fine,\u201d Hi-Fi emits a warm optimistic glow \u2013 maybe, together, we\u2019ll all be okay. It\u2019s a sentiment that\u2019s echoed throughout the record: \u201cLittle Bit More\u201d is a love call to arms, while \u201cHoles\u201d sheds sunshine on imperfections. There\u2019s something vaguely familiar about Hi-Fi, a warm orange gospel that evokes bench seats and warm steering wheels and settles snugly between nostalgia for the glory days and joy at the potential of tomorrow. Then there\u2019s \u201cHurt People.\u201d The song, which leads the EP as a single, digs deep into the gritty, sometimes uncomfortable place born of knowing someone well. It\u2019s a testament to Brantley\u2019s ever-present need to understand the world around him: he\u2019s an acute listener, and he\u2019ll tell you that getting to know people at the merch table is his favorite part of every show. In \u201cHurt People,\u201d that richness comes to life, honed in the stark depth of forgiveness by way of understanding. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone that, like [Hi-Fi producer and co-writer Mark Selby], is such a method actor,\u201d says Tia Sillers, the award-winning songwriter who co-wrote five of the six songs on Hi-Fi. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to write a song about a person, we have to go back to birth. We have to know this person\u2019s second aunt, we have to know what happened to them in fourth grade, and we have to deliberate these things.\u201d \u201cOf course all of that can\u2019t be in the song, because it\u2019s a short form\u201d Selby adds, \u201cbut the back story of these people are all there in their minds, they\u2019ve been worked out.\u201d Listening to Hi-Fi, you may just feel like a bit of your story was woven in too. So back to our original question: what to make of this talented Rick Brantley? If enough of us hear him, see him, watch him own another stage. . . well, we might just make him a household name.

The constant road life shaped the songwriting, musicianship, and work ethic of the trio.\n\nWhile Lance embarked on a Christian career in the mid-2000s, David was lighting up Arkansas with rockers TJ Scarlett and raking up area awards. But the pair kept reuniting to write music and perform an occasional show together. In 2008 their collaboration, \u201cLet\u2019s Get Country\u201d landed a spot on the soundtrack to The River Within. Fate would have it that when they decided to heed the call to form a band, Case moved back to town and ShotGunBillys were born.\n\nThe ShotGunBillys debuted with BAM! in 2014 gaining fans and radio airplay. Make no mistake The ShotGunBillys are all the good sounds southern music has to offer. They can be found rocking out with Black Oak Arkansas\u2019 Jim Dandy just as surely as jamming with The Bar-Kays\u2019 James Alexander. Their song \u201cSic My Hogs on You,\u201d a tribute anthem to Arkansas Razorback tradition and players has more than 20,000 views.\n\nOver the past 20 years the ShotGunBillys have played across the South delivering the same double-barrel thrills whether they are playing before one fan in a sleepy Arkansas roadhouse or 15,000 at Daytona Bike Week.", "otherInfo": "This Thursday Night May 14 at 7pm - Another Round of Quarantine Sound with The ShotGunBillys!

On That\u2019s What I Heard, Robert celebrates the music of Curtis Mayfield, Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland, The Sensational Nightingales and more, alongside four newly written songs. Listen to the first single \u201cAnything You Want\u201d here (by Robert Cray), available now on all streaming services.\n\nCray and Jordan go way back, having met during the making of the Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll, in 1987. They started working together in 1999, when Jordan produced the Grammy-winning Take Your Shoes Off, and the recent Grammy-nominated LP, Robert Cray & Hi Rhythm. That\u2019s What I Heard is their sixth album. \u201cOnce you start working with Steve, it\u2019s kind of hard to get away from him,\u201d said Robert.\n\nThe music on That\u2019s What I Heard falls into two camps, the sweet and the funky. Of the former, \u201cYou\u2019re the One\u201d comes from the Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland songbook. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing where I feel you kind of gotta get out of your own head when you're covering one of your heroes,\u201d Cray explained. \u201cBobby\u2019s one of those. You just let yourself go, and do the song because you love it.\u201d\n\nDon Gardner\u2019s \u201cMy Baby Likes to Boogaloo\u201d and the Billy Sha-Rae minor hit, \u201cDo It\u201d are acknowledged rarities (the originals can be heard on the compilation, Groove & Grind: Rare Soul). \u201cDo It\u201d is leaner and meaner, the sort of bare-bones funk that defined the Detroit club sound in the early \u201970s with Sha-Rae, Dennis Coffey, and Earl Van Dyke. Cray\u2019s steamroller rendition gets a little extra push from guest guitarist Ray Parker, Jr., who played in Sha-Rae\u2019s band as a teen.\n\n\u201cBurying Ground\u201d is a sacred song from the Sensational Nightingales, inspired by Cray\u2019s youth, when Sundays on the stereo were reserved for his parents\u2019 gospel records. Curtis Mayfield wrote \u201cYou\u2019ll Want Me Back\u201d for Major Lance, and Cray wrote \u201cTo Be with You\u201d for his late friend, Tony Joe White. \u201cHot\u201d is another Cray original. \u201cAs for the lyrics, \u201cWe always say to ourselves, \u2018I\u2019m old, but I\u2019m hot,\u2019\u201d he said, and laughed. Spotted hanging around the studio, Steve Perry sang harmony vocals on \u201cPromises You Can\u2019t Keep,\u201d written by Steve Jordan, Kim Wilson and Danny Kortchmar.\n\n\u201cRobert is just a great person besides being extraordinary talent,\u201d adds Jordan. \u201cPeople gravitate to his guitar playing first, but I think he\u2019s one of the best singers I\u2019ve heard in my life. Not only because of his singing ability, but his interpretations. He\u2019s such an honest soul in my opinion.\u201d\n\nRobert\u2019s band features Richard Cousins (bass), Dover Weinberg (keyboards), Terence F.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

Her instantly recognizable voice\u2014capable of being sultry, assertive and roaring\u2014delivers every song with unparalleled honesty and passion. Her wide-open vision of contemporary Americana roots and soul music showcases the evolution of a passionate artist with an up-to-the-minute musical and lyrical approach. With her new Alligator Records album, AMERICA'S CHILD, Copeland confidently announces an electrifying new chapter in her constantly evolving story. Produced by Americana Instrumentalist Of The Year winner Will Kimbrough (who also plays guitar on the album) and recorded in Nashville, AMERICA'S CHILD is a courageous and fiery statement of purpose, a major step forward for the singer whose musical consciousness continues to expand as her star continues to rise.\n\nAMERICA'S CHILD is by far Copeland\u2019s most compelling work yet, with music swelling beyond blues and into spirited Americana, with elements of rock, soul, and country. From AMERICA'S CHILD\u2019s anthemic opening track, Ain\u2019t Got Time For Hate, to the closing lullaby, the traditional Go To Sleepy Little Baby, Shemekia sings with passion and insight about the chaos and uncertainty in the world while still finding joy all around her.\n\nWith guests including John Prine, Rhiannon Giddens, Mary Gauthier, Emmylou Harris, Steve Cropper, J.D. Wilkes, Al Perkins and members of the Time Jumpers, AMERICA'S CHILD bursts with Copeland\u2019s bravado and embraces with her tenderness. Gauthier and songwriter/executive producer John Hahn wrote two striking songs for the project. Smoked Ham And Peaches is a search for truth and tranquility in America, featuring Giddens on African banjo. Americans celebrates our collective diversity in all its forms and colors. American music legend Prine joins Shemekia for a stirring duet on his own Great Rain. Guitar great Cropper adds his scorching playing to the ballad Promised Myself, written by Shemekia\u2019s father, the late bluesman Johnny Clyde Copeland. And her version of I\u2019m Not Like Everybody Else transforms the Kinks song into a blues-fueled declaration of independence.\n\nUpon the birth of her son Johnny Lee Copeland-Schultz in 2016, Shemekia, with fresh eyes, began to take an even deeper look at the state of the world. Of the new album, she says, \u201cAfter having a child, I started thinking about the world I brought him into, how it actually is and how I wished it was and all the things he will have to go through. And to live in this world today, you have to have a strong foundation like I did to make it through. So that\u2019s what 'AMERICA'S CHILD' means to me. I\u2019m truly grateful to all the artists that joined me on this record\u2014it wasn\u2019t about the genre for anyone, it was about the music and mutual love and respect.\u201d\n\nWhen Shemekia broke on the scene at age 18 in 1998 with her groundbreaking Alligator Records debut CD Turn The Heat Up, she instantly became a blues and R&B force to be reckoned with. News outlets from The New York Times to CNN praised Copeland\u2019s talent, larger-than-life personality, and true star power. With each subsequent release, Copeland\u2019s music has continued to grow. From her debut through 2005\u2019s The Soul Truth, Shemekia earned eight Blues Music Awards, a host of Living Blues Awards (including the prestigious 2010 Blues Artist Of The Year) and more accolades from fans, critics and fellow musicians. 2000\u2019s Wicked received a Grammy nomination. Two highly successful releases on Telarc (including 2012\u2019s Grammy-nominated 33 1/3) cemented her reputation as a singer who, according to NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, \u201cembodies the blues with her powerful vocal chops and fearless look at social issues.\u201d\n\nCopeland returned to Alligator Records in 2015 with the Grammy-nominated Outskirts Of Love. She won the 2017 Living Blues Readers\u2019 Award for Blues Artist Of The Year (Female), the same distinction she won the year before. She also took home the 2016 Blues Music Award (BMA) for Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year. Outskirts Of Love won the BMA for Best Blues Album Of The Year. MOJO said Copeland was \u201cspectacular, stirring, sanctified and sassy.\u201d\n\nShemekia Copeland has performed thousands of gigs at clubs, festivals and concert halls all over the world and has appeared on national television, NPR, and in newspapers, films and magazines. She\u2019s sung with Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards, Carlos Santana, James Cotton and many others. She opened for The Rolling Stones and entertained U.S. troops in Iraq and Kuwait. Jeff Beck calls her \u201camazing.\u201d Santana says, \u201cShe\u2019s incandescent...a diamond.\u201d In 2012, she performed with B.B. King, Mick Jagger, Buddy Guy, Trombone Shorty, Gary Clark, Jr. and others at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama.\n\nNow, with AMERICA'S CHILD, Shemekia Copeland is standing on the cusp of her greatest success. Her intensely empowering, American music is as insightful as it is fun. NPR Music says, \u201cShe brings a perfect balance of authority and understatement to each song.\u201d No Depression adds, \u201cWhen Shemekia Copeland opens her mouth, everybody pays attention.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Saint Asonia ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9304854.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The official Facebook of Saint Asonia.", "otherInfo": "Join us on May 14 at 8pm EST for a live Facebook concert on 97.9X WBSX."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Carlos Dias ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8534620.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Time to stay safe!\nCome to be part of my Living Room!!\nJazz, BossaNova, Samba and acoustic Rock n roll .\nI am waiting for you!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Verdine White ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Danny Glover ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Patchouli ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8980587.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Folk Pop, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Famous for that smiling voice that instantly turns a bad day into a good one, Julie Patchouli\u2019s down-to-earth, hopeful, vibrant songwriting is inspirational, positive and makes you feel good.

His musical style ranges from classical to pop.\n\nAfter only one year in the music department at Carnegie Mellon University, his choice school, Groban left when he was offered a recording contract at Warner Bros. Records through David Foster's own 143 Records imprint. With regard to signing Groban, Foster said: \"I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with\" [5]. Therefore, under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on the classics with songs such as \"Gira Con Me\" and \"Alle Luce Del Sole,\" the first ones decided on by Foster and Groban.\n\nSoon after being picked up by David Foster, Groban went on to perform \"There For Me\" with Sarah Brightman on her 2000-2001 La Luna Tour, featured on her \"La Luna\" Concert DVD, and made his recording debut by singing \"For Always\" with Lara Fabian on the movie soundtrack to A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001). He also became involved in many benefit shows, including the following: \"The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children\", singing alongside Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Don Henley and Robin Williams; \"Muhammad Ali's Fight Night Foundation\" which honored Michael J. Fox and others; \"The Family Celebration\" (2001) which was co-hosted by President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and David E. Kelley and his wife, Michelle Pfeiffer; and Michael Milken's CapCure event, which raises funds for cancer research.\n\nIn May 2001, Groban played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the season finale of the television series Ally McBeal, performing \"You're Still You.\" The series creator David E. Kelley was impressed at Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event, and, based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for Josh in this finale. The character of Malcolm Wyatt was so popular, with 8,000 emails from fans, that Groban was asked to come back the next season to reprise his role and perform \"To Where You Are.\"\n\nOn November 20, 2001, Groban's self-titled debut album Josh Groban was released and, over the next year, it went from gold to double-platinum.\n\nOn February 24, 2002, Groban performed \"The Prayer\" with Charlotte Church at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics, and by November, he had his own PBS special Josh Groban In Concert (2002). The following month, he performed \"To Where You Are\" and \"The Prayer\" at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, and joined The Corrs, Ronan Keating, Sting, Lionel Richie and others for a holiday performance at the Vatican in Rome, Italy.\n\nOn November 11, 2003, his second album Closer was released. Josh himself said that he believed that this second album was a better reflection of him and that his audience would be able to get a better idea of him personally from listening to it. \"What most people know about me, they know through my music. This time, I've tried to open that door as wide as possible. These songs are a giant step closer to who I really am and what my music is all about. Hence the title\".\n\nTwo months after Closer was released, it rose on the Billboard charts from number 11 to number one. Both of Groban's albums were produced by David Foster, released under Foster's 143 Records and distributed by Warner Music. His cover of Secret Garden's \"You Raise Me Up\" became very popular on the adult contemporary charts.\n\nJosh also performed in the soundtrack to Troy, composed by James Horner, featured in the song \"Remember Me\" with Tanja Tzarovsk. He also performed in the soundtrack to Robert Zemeckis's 2004 animated film The Polar Express, featured in the song \"Believe.\" The song is composed by Alan Silvestri and Glen Ballard.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, Josh once again returned to the birthplace of his artistic growth, Interlochen, where he gave a legendary performance to local residents of Michigan and the many, many campers, ranging from elementary school to high school age. He additionally signed many autographs, and spoke about his experiences as a young performer.\n\nOn November 30, 2004, his second live DVD, Live At The Greek, was released. It also ran as a Great Performances special on PBS. Also in 2004, Josh performed \"Remember When It Rained,\" backed by a full orchestra, at the American Music Awards where he was up for Favorite Male Artist in the pop category. Josh and his recordings were nominated for more than a dozen awards in 2004, including the American Music Award, World Music Award, Academy Award, and a Grammy.\n\nOther appearances include The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jay Leno, Larry King Live, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, 20/20, The Today Show, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl XXXVIII, and the Rockefeller Tree Lighting.\n\nDuring the first week of September 2006, Groban's latest single entitled \"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\", was exclusively released to AOL's First Listen.

It\u2019s a journey that has seen the country-rocker tour with superstars like Taylor Swift and Alan Jackson, play to over 50,000 people in Nashville at the world\u2019s biggest country music festival and build a large, devoted following as he\u2019s played the length and breadth of his native land and across the USA. Morgan has made his mark on the Australian musical landscape with a sound that fused contemporary country with melodic rock, fueled by a unique passion and energy all Morgan\u2019s own. His music is driven by an optimism shaped by life\u2019s bumpy journey, a faith in the power of love and hard work to overcome the obstacles we all face every day. Growing up in the working class beach city of Newcastle in NSW, Morgan turned the blue-collar ethic of his neighborhood into a relentless drive for energy and connection in his live shows. After seeing him whip a festival crowd into a frenzy, Warner Music Australia offered Morgan a recording contract. In 2013, after releasing two hit EPs that yielded three #1 singles, Morgan was named New Oz Artist of the Year at the CMC Music Awards. The fan voted award solidified his status as the hottest young performer in Australian country and was followed by four more trophies over the next two years, including back-to-back Male Oz Artist of the Year awards. Soon Morgan returned to Nashville to record his debut album with an all-star group of A-list musicians and Nashville based Aussie ex-pat producer Jedd Hughes. \u201cTo hear guys who played on the songs that inspired me to become a musician, playing on my songs, blew my mind,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt reminded me of why I was doing this in the first place and pushed me to take my vocals and guitar playing on the album to the next level\u201d. The songs that make up Morgan Evans are the result of a relentless songwriting schedule for almost a year that took Morgan to Nashville and back, and saw him tap into the deepest parts of himself. Morgan wrote eleven of the twelve tracks - some by himself, some with local artists and many with A-list Nashville writers. The album, released in March 2014, immediately shot to #1 on the iTunes and ARIA Country Album Charts and debuted at #20 on the ARIA Mainstream Album Chart. The impact of the acclaimed album has been immense \u2013 3 #1 singles (One Eye for an Eye, Best I Never Had and record-equaling Like A Tornado) and his first APRA nominations just for starters. The release also garnered international attention, leading to an invitation to return to Nashville\u2019s massive CMA Music Festival and perform at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, which prompted William Morris Endeavor \u2013 the world\u2019s largest talent agency \u2013 to sign Morgan up for international representation. Morgan\u2019s charisma and talent for engaging audiences led to his signing as the face of Foxtel\u2019s Country Music Channel, which has already seen him nominated for an ASTRA Award and a TV Week Logie Award \u2013 a first for an Australian country music star. He hosts television coverage of the CMC Rocks music festival, artist interviews and the CMC Music Awards. He was joined in 2016 by international co-host Kelsea Ballerini for the live national broadcast. A major career milestone was capped off when Morgan received a message from Grammy-winners Lady Antebellum informing him that he\u2019d been awarded the prestigious 2015 CMA Global Artist Award. The award recognizes outstanding achievement by an international country star in furthering the popularity of country music in their home country. Morgan joins an exceptional list of previous winners including Tommy Emmanuel, Kasey Chambers and Lee Kernaghan. Since then, Morgan has his sights set once again on Nashville, relocating to Music City where he has been writing with the A-list of songwriters for his upcoming US debut release and recently made return performances to CMA Music Fest and the Grand Ole Opry. His growing fanbase in both Australia and the USA is eagerly awaiting new music from Morgan, expected to be released later this year. http://www.morganevansmusic.com \"Kiss Somebody\" Out Now: https://wmna.sh/me_kisssomebod Twitter: @Morgan_Evans Instagram: @morganevansmusic Snapchat: themorganevans", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marc Ribot ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8757261.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Alternative, Folk, Jazz, Rock, Classical", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cEvery movement which has ever won anything has had songs,\u201d says Marc Ribot.\n\nWith his new album Songs of Resistance 1948 - 2018, Ribot\u2014one of the world\u2019s most accomplished and acclaimed guitar players\u2014set out to assemble a set of songs that spoke to this political moment with appropriate ambition, passion, and fury. The eleven songs on the record are drawn from the World War II anti-Fascist Italian partisans, the U.S. civil rights movement, and Mexican protest ballads, as well as original compositions, and feature a wide range of guest vocalists, including Tom Waits, Steve Earle, Meshell Ndegeocello, Justin Vivian Bond, Fay Victor, Sam Amidon, and Ohene Cornelius.\n\nRibot began working on the project at the end of 2016, responding not just to the American elections, but to the political trends he was seeing around the world. \u201cI am alarmed by Trump and the movement he\u2019s part of,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a good chunk of my life running around the world on tour\u2014I\u2019m kind of an accidental internationalist\u2014and I see that he\u2019s not an isolated phenomenon. And if we don\u2019t deal with what is going on, it is going to deal with us.\u201d\n\nOver a forty-year career, Ribot has released twenty-five albums under his own name and been a beacon of New York\u2019s downtown/experimental music scene, leading a series of bands including Los Cubanos Postizos and Ceramic Dog. Since his work with Tom Waits on 1985\u2019s Rain Dogs album, though, he is best known to the world as a sideman, playing on countless albums by the likes of Elvis Costello, John Mellencamp, Norah Jones, the Black Keys, and Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\u2019 Grammy-winning collaboration Raising Sand.\n\nAlong with his musical efforts, Ribot has also been an outspoken activist/community organizer in a number of causes, from affordable housing to musicians\u2019 rights in the digital age. During his time on the protest lines, he became aware of the diminishing role that music has played in recent years.\n\n\u201cI remember being at Occupy Wall Street early one morning because there was a report that the cops were going to come and break things up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a moment when people needed something to sing. They tried Tom Petty\u2019s \u2018I Won\u2019t Back Down,\u2019 but it didn\u2019t quite fit. It frustrated me that we had this rich history of songs for that occasion, but nobody knew them.\n\n\u201cOn this record, there\u2019s a song from the American civil rights movement that people traditionally sang when they were being arrested called \u2018[We Are] Soldiers in the Army.\u2019 Sound can travel into the paddy wagons and jail cells where people are isolated, and people in the civil rights movement needed that song to remind them that they\u2019re not alone. Songs can also remind us that we\u2019re not alone spiritually or historically: in fact, we have some pretty great company. But singing together is more than just gesture: it\u2019s a political act in itself: when people are willing to sing \u2018WE are soldiers in the army/[we have to fight/ we also have to cry]\u2019, that\u2019s half the battle right there.\u201d\n\nMost of the material for Songs of Resistance was chosen by March 2017; over the next eight months, singers were being matched with songs and tracks were recorded whenever and wherever possible. \u201cThough this record has some well-known people on it, it wasn\u2019t star-focused, says Ribot. \u201cI wanted to include people who felt a personal connection, who understood the project culturally and politically and were really involved in the process.\u201d\n\nOne critical participant was Waits\u2014with whom Ribot has frequently collaborated over the last three decades\u2014who sings \u201cBella Ciao (Goodbye Beautiful),\u201d an Italian partisan ballad. \u201cI played Tom a bunch of the tunes and he immediately bonded with that one,\u201d says Ribot. \u201cOf course, he brings a certain gravitas to everything he does\u2014my Italian friends say he sounds exactly like an old \u2018partigiano\u2019 (resistance fighter)!\u201d\n\nSteve Earle joins Ribot on one of the album\u2019s new compositions, which are largely based on texts the guitarist encountered as news stories or overheard conversation. \u201cSrinivas\u201d is a metered version of news articles on Srinivas Kuchibhotla, a Sikh immigrant murdered in February 2017 by a racist who mistook him for a Muslim. \u201cIn the original version,\u201d Ribot points out, \u201cI had named the guy who shot him, but Steve changed that\u2014he said, \u2018That guy is just some poor idiot, it\u2019s not about him, it\u2019s about the ones who set him up.\u2019 That kind of intelligence and wisdom coming from the artist was important to me.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way Steve Earle is going to be a sock puppet for anyone else\u2019s voice, and that\u2019s exactly the kind of situation I wanted. It\u2019s cool to have professional protest singers and all that, but I wanted to include artists who reached outside the \u2018protest\u2019 bubble.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cThe Militant Ecologist\u201d (based on another Italian anti-Fascist song called \u201cFischia Il Vento\u201d), Ribot turned to the magnificent singer/songwriter/bassist Meshell Ndegeocello. \u201cWe changed the gender in our version, and the flag at the end is green, not red. But Meshell projects the persona of a resistance fighter going on a mission perfectly: \u2018strong her heart, and swift her arm to strike.\u201d\n\nFor Marc Ribot, the creation of Songs of Resistance was not just an act of protest, but also a path to discovery. \u201cI went through a lot of self-examination,\u201d he says. \u201cI kept asking \u2018What gives us the right to perform this song or access this history or change this lyric?\u2019 Sometimes we had to change an arrangement, to add and build on the original, or change the context. The struggle to find out which songs to perform, how (and with who) to perform them\u2014to learn how we can live the musical ideas from our past NOW\u2014is ongoing, and it extends beyond music.\u201d\n\nAt a time of such overwhelming social turmoil, finding a focus for this kind of project is challenging. But Ribot\u2019s purpose remained clear. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of contradiction in doing any kind of political music,\u201d he says, \u201chow to act against something without becoming it, without resembling what you detest. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out what to do, and I imagine we\u2019ll make mistakes, and hopefully, learn from them. But I knew this from the moment Donald Trump was elected: I\u2019m not going to play downtown scene Furtwangler to any orange-comb-over dictator wannabe. No way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen democracy is threatened, people who value it need to work together to defend it. When basic human rights are threatened by racists, sexists, and homophobes, we need to respond. I don\u2019t know what \u201cthe answer\u201d is: but I know this: If we\u2019re not able to work together, we\u2019re going to get our asses kicked separately.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Steel Wheels ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8620292.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Original Americana Roots Music", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, The Steel Wheels are familiar with the traditions of folk music and how a string band is supposed to sound.

The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama/Avi & Celia) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center. From 2013-16, Salloway toured the globe with Bombino, the Tuareg guitar hero from Niger, Africa. While on the journey and since returning, Salloway wrote the material on the band\u2019s latest album, Strike the Match (Sand & Gold Records).\n\nSalloway has been bringing these songs to life with the Wylder Family, a group of dear friends and musical kindred spirits. In between shows, the band spent ten days recording at Eyeland Studio in the Columbus Theatre, home of The Low Anthem. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert: think Andrew Bird meets Ali Farka Toure, Pete Seeger and Talking Heads. Strike the Match expands on American musical traditions, building a bridge to their African roots and coloring the songs with experimental art-rock textures: gilded string lines, synthesizers, and angular guitars. Mother Earth is at its center, surrounded by stories of love, conflict, change and dreams.\n\nSalloway shares, \u201cThis album is a reflection of the world we\u2019ve been born into, one filled with supernatural beauty and incomprehensible struggle. My social and environmental activism work has taken me to territories that have been colonized and occupied in the Middle East, North and West Africa, the South Pacific and Standing Rock, here at home. I have experienced the creative spirit rise up in the face of darkness and adversity and it is the most life-affirming feeling I have witnessed. This record has become the artifact at the intersection of these moving events in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Strike the Match, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most pressing questions of our time. How can we reorient ourselves to nature as a source of strength for resistance to the forces that seek to destroy and profit from it? How can we use music to move beyond capitalism and nationalism to a global society for the benefit of the earth and all living beings? How can we reconcile our painful history with hope and optimism for the future? The album calls the listener to engage with these questions and illuminates the path towards participating in the creation of a more just and sustainable world.\n\nThe band is named after Salloway\u2019s grandmother, Wilma \u201cBillie\u201d Hotaling.\u201d She was a prolific painter, author, musician, and educator. Billie wrote Count the Stars Through the Cracks, a harrowing historical fiction novel about a young brother and sister\u2019s escape from the Antebellum South along the Underground Railroad. Billie\u2019s writing was raw and fearless and her book delivered a powerful narrative about America\u2019s hard truths and the long journey to freedom. \u201cMy grandma Billie led by example, showing me what creativity looks like and how critical art can be as a form of love and resistance. She is part of me and part of the Wylder family,\u201d Salloway reflects.\n\n\u201cRaised in a progressive home and taught to play by Pete and John Seeger, activism is a constant in Avi Salloway\u2019s life and art.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Robert Cray ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9945280.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Robert Cray Band Music", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cFunky, cool and bad,\u201d is how Robert Cray describes his latest album, That\u2019s What I Heard, out February 28. \u201cI thought if it we could get this thing that Sam Cooke used to have, the kind of sound that early Sam Cooke records had, that we could pull this off,\u201d says producer Steve Jordan.\n\nOver the past four decades, Cray has created a sound that rises from American roots, blues, soul and R&B, with five Grammy wins, 20 acclaimed studio albums and a bundle of live albums that punctuate the Blues Hall of Famer\u2019s career. On That\u2019s What I Heard, Robert celebrates the music of Curtis Mayfield, Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland, The Sensational Nightingales and more, alongside four newly written songs. Listen to the first single \u201cAnything You Want\u201d here (by Robert Cray), available now on all streaming services.\n\nCray and Jordan go way back, having met during the making of the Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll, in 1987. They started working together in 1999, when Jordan produced the Grammy-winning Take Your Shoes Off, and the recent Grammy-nominated LP, Robert Cray & Hi Rhythm. That\u2019s What I Heard is their sixth album. \u201cOnce you start working with Steve, it\u2019s kind of hard to get away from him,\u201d said Robert.\n\nThe music on That\u2019s What I Heard falls into two camps, the sweet and the funky. Of the former, \u201cYou\u2019re the One\u201d comes from the Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland songbook. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing where I feel you kind of gotta get out of your own head when you're covering one of your heroes,\u201d Cray explained. \u201cBobby\u2019s one of those. You just let yourself go, and do the song because you love it.\u201d\n\nDon Gardner\u2019s \u201cMy Baby Likes to Boogaloo\u201d and the Billy Sha-Rae minor hit, \u201cDo It\u201d are acknowledged rarities (the originals can be heard on the compilation, Groove & Grind: Rare Soul). \u201cDo It\u201d is leaner and meaner, the sort of bare-bones funk that defined the Detroit club sound in the early \u201970s with Sha-Rae, Dennis Coffey, and Earl Van Dyke. Cray\u2019s steamroller rendition gets a little extra push from guest guitarist Ray Parker, Jr., who played in Sha-Rae\u2019s band as a teen.\n\n\u201cBurying Ground\u201d is a sacred song from the Sensational Nightingales, inspired by Cray\u2019s youth, when Sundays on the stereo were reserved for his parents\u2019 gospel records. Curtis Mayfield wrote \u201cYou\u2019ll Want Me Back\u201d for Major Lance, and Cray wrote \u201cTo Be with You\u201d for his late friend, Tony Joe White. \u201cHot\u201d is another Cray original. \u201cAs for the lyrics, \u201cWe always say to ourselves, \u2018I\u2019m old, but I\u2019m hot,\u2019\u201d he said, and laughed. Spotted hanging around the studio, Steve Perry sang harmony vocals on \u201cPromises You Can\u2019t Keep,\u201d written by Steve Jordan, Kim Wilson and Danny Kortchmar.\n\n\u201cRobert is just a great person besides being extraordinary talent,\u201d adds Jordan. \u201cPeople gravitate to his guitar playing first, but I think he\u2019s one of the best singers I\u2019ve heard in my life. Not only because of his singing ability, but his interpretations. He\u2019s such an honest soul in my opinion.\u201d\n\nRobert\u2019s band features Richard Cousins (bass), Dover Weinberg (keyboards), Terence F.

Her instantly recognizable voice\u2014capable of being sultry, assertive and roaring\u2014delivers every song with unparalleled honesty and passion. Her wide-open vision of contemporary Americana roots and soul music showcases the evolution of a passionate artist with an up-to-the-minute musical and lyrical approach. With her new Alligator Records album, AMERICA'S CHILD, Copeland confidently announces an electrifying new chapter in her constantly evolving story. Produced by Americana Instrumentalist Of The Year winner Will Kimbrough (who also plays guitar on the album) and recorded in Nashville, AMERICA'S CHILD is a courageous and fiery statement of purpose, a major step forward for the singer whose musical consciousness continues to expand as her star continues to rise.\n\nAMERICA'S CHILD is by far Copeland\u2019s most compelling work yet, with music swelling beyond blues and into spirited Americana, with elements of rock, soul, and country. From AMERICA'S CHILD\u2019s anthemic opening track, Ain\u2019t Got Time For Hate, to the closing lullaby, the traditional Go To Sleepy Little Baby, Shemekia sings with passion and insight about the chaos and uncertainty in the world while still finding joy all around her.\n\nWith guests including John Prine, Rhiannon Giddens, Mary Gauthier, Emmylou Harris, Steve Cropper, J.D. Wilkes, Al Perkins and members of the Time Jumpers, AMERICA'S CHILD bursts with Copeland\u2019s bravado and embraces with her tenderness. Gauthier and songwriter/executive producer John Hahn wrote two striking songs for the project. Smoked Ham And Peaches is a search for truth and tranquility in America, featuring Giddens on African banjo. Americans celebrates our collective diversity in all its forms and colors. American music legend Prine joins Shemekia for a stirring duet on his own Great Rain. Guitar great Cropper adds his scorching playing to the ballad Promised Myself, written by Shemekia\u2019s father, the late bluesman Johnny Clyde Copeland. And her version of I\u2019m Not Like Everybody Else transforms the Kinks song into a blues-fueled declaration of independence.\n\nUpon the birth of her son Johnny Lee Copeland-Schultz in 2016, Shemekia, with fresh eyes, began to take an even deeper look at the state of the world. Of the new album, she says, \u201cAfter having a child, I started thinking about the world I brought him into, how it actually is and how I wished it was and all the things he will have to go through. And to live in this world today, you have to have a strong foundation like I did to make it through. So that\u2019s what 'AMERICA'S CHILD' means to me. I\u2019m truly grateful to all the artists that joined me on this record\u2014it wasn\u2019t about the genre for anyone, it was about the music and mutual love and respect.\u201d\n\nWhen Shemekia broke on the scene at age 18 in 1998 with her groundbreaking Alligator Records debut CD Turn The Heat Up, she instantly became a blues and R&B force to be reckoned with. News outlets from The New York Times to CNN praised Copeland\u2019s talent, larger-than-life personality, and true star power. With each subsequent release, Copeland\u2019s music has continued to grow. From her debut through 2005\u2019s The Soul Truth, Shemekia earned eight Blues Music Awards, a host of Living Blues Awards (including the prestigious 2010 Blues Artist Of The Year) and more accolades from fans, critics and fellow musicians. 2000\u2019s Wicked received a Grammy nomination. Two highly successful releases on Telarc (including 2012\u2019s Grammy-nominated 33 1/3) cemented her reputation as a singer who, according to NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, \u201cembodies the blues with her powerful vocal chops and fearless look at social issues.\u201d\n\nCopeland returned to Alligator Records in 2015 with the Grammy-nominated Outskirts Of Love. She won the 2017 Living Blues Readers\u2019 Award for Blues Artist Of The Year (Female), the same distinction she won the year before. She also took home the 2016 Blues Music Award (BMA) for Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year. Outskirts Of Love won the BMA for Best Blues Album Of The Year. MOJO said Copeland was \u201cspectacular, stirring, sanctified and sassy.\u201d\n\nShemekia Copeland has performed thousands of gigs at clubs, festivals and concert halls all over the world and has appeared on national television, NPR, and in newspapers, films and magazines. She\u2019s sung with Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards, Carlos Santana, James Cotton and many others. She opened for The Rolling Stones and entertained U.S. troops in Iraq and Kuwait. Jeff Beck calls her \u201camazing.\u201d Santana says, \u201cShe\u2019s incandescent...a diamond.\u201d In 2012, she performed with B.B. King, Mick Jagger, Buddy Guy, Trombone Shorty, Gary Clark, Jr. and others at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama.\n\nNow, with AMERICA'S CHILD, Shemekia Copeland is standing on the cusp of her greatest success. Her intensely empowering, American music is as insightful as it is fun. NPR Music says, \u201cShe brings a perfect balance of authority and understatement to each song.\u201d No Depression adds, \u201cWhen Shemekia Copeland opens her mouth, everybody pays attention. She pierces your soul.

Records through David Foster's own 143 Records imprint. With regard to signing Groban, Foster said: \"I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with\" [5]. Therefore, under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on the classics with songs such as \"Gira Con Me\" and \"Alle Luce Del Sole,\" the first ones decided on by Foster and Groban.\n\nSoon after being picked up by David Foster, Groban went on to perform \"There For Me\" with Sarah Brightman on her 2000-2001 La Luna Tour, featured on her \"La Luna\" Concert DVD, and made his recording debut by singing \"For Always\" with Lara Fabian on the movie soundtrack to A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001).

Hence the title\".\n\nTwo months after Closer was released, it rose on the Billboard charts from number 11 to number one. Both of Groban's albums were produced by David Foster, released under Foster's 143 Records and distributed by Warner Music. His cover of Secret Garden's \"You Raise Me Up\" became very popular on the adult contemporary charts.\n\nJosh also performed in the soundtrack to Troy, composed by James Horner, featured in the song \"Remember Me\" with Tanja Tzarovsk. He also performed in the soundtrack to Robert Zemeckis's 2004 animated film The Polar Express, featured in the song \"Believe.\" The song is composed by Alan Silvestri and Glen Ballard.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, Josh once again returned to the birthplace of his artistic growth, Interlochen, where he gave a legendary performance to local residents of Michigan and the many, many campers, ranging from elementary school to high school age. He additionally signed many autographs, and spoke about his experiences as a young performer.\n\nOn November 30, 2004, his second live DVD, Live At The Greek, was released. It also ran as a Great Performances special on PBS. Also in 2004, Josh performed \"Remember When It Rained,\" backed by a full orchestra, at the American Music Awards where he was up for Favorite Male Artist in the pop category. Josh and his recordings were nominated for more than a dozen awards in 2004, including the American Music Award, World Music Award, Academy Award, and a Grammy.\n\nOther appearances include The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jay Leno, Larry King Live, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, 20/20, The Today Show, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl XXXVIII, and the Rockefeller Tree Lighting.\n\nDuring the first week of September 2006, Groban's latest single entitled \"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\", was exclusively released to AOL's First Listen.

The eleven songs on the record are drawn from the World War II anti-Fascist Italian partisans, the U.S. civil rights movement, and Mexican protest ballads, as well as original compositions, and feature a wide range of guest vocalists, including Tom Waits, Steve Earle, Meshell Ndegeocello, Justin Vivian Bond, Fay Victor, Sam Amidon, and Ohene Cornelius.\n\nRibot began working on the project at the end of 2016, responding not just to the American elections, but to the political trends he was seeing around the world. \u201cI am alarmed by Trump and the movement he\u2019s part of,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a good chunk of my life running around the world on tour\u2014I\u2019m kind of an accidental internationalist\u2014and I see that he\u2019s not an isolated phenomenon. And if we don\u2019t deal with what is going on, it is going to deal with us.\u201d\n\nOver a forty-year career, Ribot has released twenty-five albums under his own name and been a beacon of New York\u2019s downtown/experimental music scene, leading a series of bands including Los Cubanos Postizos and Ceramic Dog. Since his work with Tom Waits on 1985\u2019s Rain Dogs album, though, he is best known to the world as a sideman, playing on countless albums by the likes of Elvis Costello, John Mellencamp, Norah Jones, the Black Keys, and Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\u2019 Grammy-winning collaboration Raising Sand.\n\nAlong with his musical efforts, Ribot has also been an outspoken activist/community organizer in a number of causes, from affordable housing to musicians\u2019 rights in the digital age. During his time on the protest lines, he became aware of the diminishing role that music has played in recent years.\n\n\u201cI remember being at Occupy Wall Street early one morning because there was a report that the cops were going to come and break things up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a moment when people needed something to sing. They tried Tom Petty\u2019s \u2018I Won\u2019t Back Down,\u2019 but it didn\u2019t quite fit. It frustrated me that we had this rich history of songs for that occasion, but nobody knew them.\n\n\u201cOn this record, there\u2019s a song from the American civil rights movement that people traditionally sang when they were being arrested called \u2018[We Are] Soldiers in the Army.\u2019 Sound can travel into the paddy wagons and jail cells where people are isolated, and people in the civil rights movement needed that song to remind them that they\u2019re not alone. Songs can also remind us that we\u2019re not alone spiritually or historically: in fact, we have some pretty great company. But singing together is more than just gesture: it\u2019s a political act in itself: when people are willing to sing \u2018WE are soldiers in the army/[we have to fight/ we also have to cry]\u2019, that\u2019s half the battle right there.\u201d\n\nMost of the material for Songs of Resistance was chosen by March 2017; over the next eight months, singers were being matched with songs and tracks were recorded whenever and wherever possible. \u201cThough this record has some well-known people on it, it wasn\u2019t star-focused, says Ribot. \u201cI wanted to include people who felt a personal connection, who understood the project culturally and politically and were really involved in the process.\u201d\n\nOne critical participant was Waits\u2014with whom Ribot has frequently collaborated over the last three decades\u2014who sings \u201cBella Ciao (Goodbye Beautiful),\u201d an Italian partisan ballad. \u201cI played Tom a bunch of the tunes and he immediately bonded with that one,\u201d says Ribot. \u201cOf course, he brings a certain gravitas to everything he does\u2014my Italian friends say he sounds exactly like an old \u2018partigiano\u2019 (resistance fighter)!\u201d\n\nSteve Earle joins Ribot on one of the album\u2019s new compositions, which are largely based on texts the guitarist encountered as news stories or overheard conversation. \u201cSrinivas\u201d is a metered version of news articles on Srinivas Kuchibhotla, a Sikh immigrant murdered in February 2017 by a racist who mistook him for a Muslim. \u201cIn the original version,\u201d Ribot points out, \u201cI had named the guy who shot him, but Steve changed that\u2014he said, \u2018That guy is just some poor idiot, it\u2019s not about him, it\u2019s about the ones who set him up.\u2019 That kind of intelligence and wisdom coming from the artist was important to me.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way Steve Earle is going to be a sock puppet for anyone else\u2019s voice, and that\u2019s exactly the kind of situation I wanted. It\u2019s cool to have professional protest singers and all that, but I wanted to include artists who reached outside the \u2018protest\u2019 bubble.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cThe Militant Ecologist\u201d (based on another Italian anti-Fascist song called \u201cFischia Il Vento\u201d), Ribot turned to the magnificent singer/songwriter/bassist Meshell Ndegeocello. \u201cWe changed the gender in our version, and the flag at the end is green, not red. But Meshell projects the persona of a resistance fighter going on a mission perfectly: \u2018strong her heart, and swift her arm to strike.\u201d\n\nFor Marc Ribot, the creation of Songs of Resistance was not just an act of protest, but also a path to discovery. \u201cI went through a lot of self-examination,\u201d he says. \u201cI kept asking \u2018What gives us the right to perform this song or access this history or change this lyric?\u2019 Sometimes we had to change an arrangement, to add and build on the original, or change the context. The struggle to find out which songs to perform, how (and with who) to perform them\u2014to learn how we can live the musical ideas from our past NOW\u2014is ongoing, and it extends beyond music.\u201d\n\nAt a time of such overwhelming social turmoil, finding a focus for this kind of project is challenging. But Ribot\u2019s purpose remained clear. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of contradiction in doing any kind of political music,\u201d he says, \u201chow to act against something without becoming it, without resembling what you detest. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out what to do, and I imagine we\u2019ll make mistakes, and hopefully, learn from them. But I knew this from the moment Donald Trump was elected: I\u2019m not going to play downtown scene Furtwangler to any orange-comb-over dictator wannabe. No way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen democracy is threatened, people who value it need to work together to defend it. When basic human rights are threatened by racists, sexists, and homophobes, we need to respond. I don\u2019t know what \u201cthe answer\u201d is: but I know this: If we\u2019re not able to work together, we\u2019re going to get our asses kicked separately.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fat Joe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7303966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Hip Hop, Rap", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fat Joe (born Joseph Cartagena on August 19, 1970) is an American rapper.

They were nominated for a Grammy in 2013 for their second album \u2018The Life and Times Of\u2026\u2019. and, with acclaimed releases such as \u2018Vicennial...\u2019, \u2018On The Spot\u2019 and \u201cTake Cover\u201d, continue to exemplify their ability to honour their city\u2019s musical traditions while forging their own powerful legacy. Hot 8\u2019s incredible tale, which comes across in their life-affirming music, has also previously featured in Spike Lee\u2019s two New Orleans documentaries, When The Levees Broke and The Creek Don\u2019t Rise, and David Simon\u2019s HBO series Treme (in which the band played themselves), to add to extensive features across the world\u2019s media.\n\nMixing an old school street brass approach with funkier currents and hip hop vocals, Hot 8\u2019s magnificent originals are juxtaposed with fresh versions of Snoop Dogg, Stevie Wonder, The Specials, Basement Jaxx and of course their anthemic take on Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cSexual Healing\u201d.\nHot 8 Brass Band\u2019s rhythms are loose-limbed and hard-hitting, with most tracks featuring a sousaphone prominently.

Jazz funerals are among the most curious and well-known New Orleans brass band customs. As an exercise of the belief in \u201crejoicing at death,\u201d the jazz funeral juxtaposes grief and joy. Slow, sad hymns and dirges are played en route to the cemetery, followed by up-tempo songs and joyous second line dancing in a final procession away from the grave.\nThe city\u2019s traditional obsession with music, parades, dancing, and the rise of black benevolent organizations, has helped to maintain and support brass band activities and culture. Dozens of benevolent societies and groups known as \u201csocial aid & pleasure clubs\u201d sponsor weekly Sunday parades. Very different from New Orleans\u2019 better known Eurocentric Mardi Gras parades, the black social club events consist of three main parts: divisions of colorfully dressed social club members, one or more brass bands and the second line\u2014a crowd of up to several thousand people who follow and dance alongside the parade throughout its several-hour duration. The free-form second line dance performed by club members and the crowd, both of whom dance with umbrellas and handkerchiefs, is derived from West African processions. The intensity that builds from the constant creative interaction between hot music and improvised dancing often erupts into a euphoric dimension in which a sense of total freedom, equality, limitless power, and a spiritual redefining of earthly reality seem to overtake all of the participants. Many legendary and influential musicians who would migrate from New Orleans by the 1920s and influence the direction of American music\u2014among them King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, and Sidney Bechet\u2014got some of their early training and experience in street parades and funerals.\nThe story of the Hot 8 Brass Band has been one of tragedy and triumph. Over the years the Hot 8\u2019s ranks have been decimated by the deaths of four original members due to street violence and illness. The devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was a life-altering turning point; during which 80% of New Orleans flooded, untold numbers of inhabitants died, and long-term displacement and misery affected hundreds of thousands\u2014raised real concerns about the survival of the city and its indigenous cultural traditions. After being evacuated, displaced, and scattered across the country, the band regrouped and began touring the United States to encourage and support other displaced Katrina victims and promote New Orleans\u2019 recovery.\nHot 8 Brass Band are signed to Tru Thoughts, based in Brighton, UK.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jason Fowler ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10378294.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Christian", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Just read the lyrics to any of your favorite Led Zeppelin, The Allman Brothers Band, Peter Gabriel, or U2 tunes and chances are you would be quite familiar with Jason Fowler\u2019s life story. The Georgia native has lived a life that truly reflects his art \u2013 troubled to some, enviable to many and yet remarkable to most anyone who hears the soft-spoken musician recount it.\n\nFowler admits that his diehard, all-or-nothing approach to life has sometimes been both a blessing and a curse. But lately, it\u2019s all been a blessing. That wasn\u2019t the case at the start of his musical journey.\n\nLiving a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle eventually caused the artist to hit rock bottom. \u201cAt rock bottom,\u201d Jason says, \u201cThat's where I began recovering from a place of hopelessness.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt is also where I discovered that it was not God who left me, but I who left Him.\u201d He went from a rising star with a lucrative record contract, to being addicted and homeless on the streets of Atlanta, to finding redemption through Grace \u2013 and now he shares that story through his music.\n\nFowler grew up in a musical family and notes, \u201cMy dad sings like Pavarotti, my Uncle Mike taught me guitar, and my Uncle Chris has a doctorate in musical performance. Some of my earliest memories were at my granny\u2019s house, with everyone singing and dancing to \u201cPony Boy\u201d by The Allman Brothers Band.\n\nWhen Fowler was sixteen he heard a friend playing Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d on guitar. This sparked his musical fire and Jason bought his first guitar. Shortly after his dad offered him a new guitar if he learned to play \u201cJessica,\u201d also by The Allman Brothers Band.\n\n\u201cI think my dad was hoping I would give him a couple of weeks,\u201d Fowler smiles, \u201cbut I went and played it for him that night.\u201d\n\nFowler honed his talents for music and writing as a teen. By his twenties he was working on several projects and ultimately landed a record deal with his band Ultraphonic. They were produced by Bryan Holmes (The Producers) and, coincidentally, Johnny Sandlin, who produced The Allman Brothers Band, Widespread Panic and Wet Willie. Fowler and his band spent several months recording with the legendary \u201cSwampers\u201d at MS Sound in Muscle Shoals, Alabama \u2013 just like the song.\n\nThen the unthinkable happened\u2026\n\nThe record label was bought out by Microsoft and the album was shelved. What seemed to be the pinnacle of a life long-held dream, ended up a nightmare of epic proportions. After the breakup of the label, band, and dreams of stardom, Fowler landed a solo deal with Mil Cannon at Imagemil in Atlanta (Usher, Whitney Houston, Carrie Underwood). Fowler was given another chance. With expectations high, Fowler was on his way back, but still carrying his old hurts, habits, and hangups, fueled by drugs and alcohol. By this time Jason didn\u2019t know how to live a sober life, which affected his personal and professional relationships. His tenure at Imagemil didn\u2019t last very long. Mil and members of the Imagemil team confronted Fowler with the facts: he was out of control and needed help. They had to let him go.\n\nFowler was stubborn and his substance abuse issues did not go away quietly. Over time, he spiraled, ending up homeless and alone. After being kicked out of a drug dealer\u2019s house, Fowler finally waved the white flag of surrender.\n\nBroken, lost, and hopeless, Fowler entered a Christian-based rehab in Athens, Georgia, called The Healing Place. He stayed there for an entire year, but it was in that facility where the fog eventually lifted and Fowler rededicated his life to Jesus. \u201cIt\u2019s like a country song backwards,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI started getting things back in my life instead of losing them. I had lost, my relationship with God, my family, my friends, and myself.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t a sad ending. This was simply the end of his old life, and a new beginning of Fowler\u2019s career as a Christian artist, a worship leader and a speaker.\n\nFowler\u2019s debut solo album, Letters from the Inside (Black Cat Records, 2014), was produced by Jason Hoard (Third Day, Mac Powell, Jamie Grace, Natalie Grant). Musically it tells his journey back from homelessness, addiction, and hopelessness. It took almost five years for Fowler to clear his head and his musical passion to return.\n\n\u201cI was becoming more involved in church and in my recovery. I started feeling like my reason for being here is to praise God,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cBut I also needed to share my story of where I was, what happened, and what it\u2019s like today.\u201d\n\nThe songs from Letters from the Inside were snapshots of Fowler\u2019s journey and newfound faith. The ten songs were recorded in Griffin, Georgia over a period of two months. Fowler recruited long time friend and drummer Shane Evans, formerly of Collective Soul, as the backbone of the album and his touring band. The two began to share the message of hope and redemption, mostly to young people and up-and-coming musicians who were about to embark on their own journeys.\n\nI Fall In (Rcity Records, 2016) is Fowler\u2019s second album, which took Fowler on a sojourn to Nashville. It was there where he recorded at Dark Horse Studios with Grammy-nominated producer Billy Smiley (White Heart, Johnny Cash, Bebe and Cece Winans). Together they recruited a heavy-hitter list of talented artists for his sophomore effort, which included Leigh Nash (Sixpence None the Richer), Will Turpin (Collective Soul), Peter Furler (Newsboys), Steve Brewster (Chicago, Bob Seger, Amy Grant), Anthony Sallee (Michael W. Smith, White Heart), Jillian Edwards, Blair Masters (Casting Crowns, Garth Brooks, Mercy Me), and Jared Kneale (Kacey Musgrave, Ben Rector), and even his aunt, Joy Waters Fowler, to name just a few. The album also provided an opportunity for Fowler to mend his relationship with Imagemil founder Mil Cannon, who directed Fowler in three music videos.\n\nThe Nashville adventure also led to a professional collaboration with legendary vocalist John Schlitt (Petra, Head East) and Billy Smiley (Whiteheart) to form The Union of Sinners and Saints in 2016. They followed up their 12-song debut album with a nationwide tour of churches and venues, singing, sharing their testimonies and witnessing to fellow Christians about their fame, follies and fellowship.\n\nJason also shares his writing and performing talents with Will Turpin of Collective Soul on his latest release Serengeti Drivers (Gooey Records, 2018). The two collaborated on five songs and will tour the southeast behind the album, which took four years to complete.\n\nFowler is currently working with Dove winning and Grammy nominated producers Ian Eskelin and Barry Weeks (Francesca Battistelli, 7eventh Time Down), putting the final touches on his third solo album earmarked for an early 2019 release.\n\nIn between recording projects, Fowler tours the United States and Canada, sharing his story of rock, recovery and redemption.", "otherInfo": "Let\u2019s get together this Thursday, May 14th at 8:00pm EST for some music and fellowship!\nTune in at Facebook.com/JasonFowlerMusic."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Miss Tess ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9716909.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Early Rock And Roll, Country Blues, American Roots Music, Western Swing, Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When most people think of defiant music, they think of punk rock or outlaw country.

It's a fitting image for young Chicago guitar hero RONNIE BAKER BROOKS on his aptly titled third release, THE TORCH. Not only does he sing with soulful fire and play with a white-hot intensity; he's also carrying the torch from the previous generation of soul and blues greats and moving the music into the future.\n\nAs the 17 original songs on THE TORCH make clear, RBB is the right man for the job. Brooks grew up steeped in American music tradition yet his focus remains resolutely on the future. As well as anyone of his generation, he knows the transcendent release at the heart of soul, blues and rock. He knows because, as the son of blues great Lonnie Brooks, he came of age watching the fieriest guitar players and most soulful singers of a previous era express their deepest feelings through their music.\n\n\"I grew up among the best of the best,\" Brooks says. \"Every time I play, I feel like I've got to do it with the authenticity and passion that I saw in guys like Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, B.B. King and my father. But I also have to put my twist on it. None of those guys repeated what came before them.\"\n\nBrooks' twist involves enlivening blues-rock with deep soul and modern hip-hop vocals and funk rhythms. Working with Minneapolis producer Jellybean Johnson, a veteran collaborator of Prince and Janet Jackson, Brooks takes roots sounds and transforms them into something that spans the ages.\n\n\"I like to think of how Muddy Waters took the Mississippi blues he heard in his youth and modernized it for his times by making it electric and harder,\" Brooks explains. \"That's what I'm trying to do for my generation. I want to take what's authentic and powerful about the music I grew up loving and bring in other influences without losing the heart and conviction of it.\"\n\nBrooks' personal touch also shines through in the concise, colorful songs for THE TORCH, all of which he wrote. He draws on the choppy, hip-shaking rhythms of funk, the emotional truth of soul and the forcefulness of rock to bring a distinctive dimension to his groundbreaking sound. Who else would, or could, record a song featuring classic Chicago artists Lonnie Brooks, Eddy Clearwater, Jimmy Johnson and the late Willie Kent with another highlighting rapper Al Kapone.\n\n\"I wanted to do something that would bring young people to the blues, and then give them the real hardcore thing at the same time,\" Brooks says. \"When I grew up, all my friends listened to rap and funk, and I listened to the blues. So I heard their music and they heard mine. I think we both saw some connection between them. I like that line in the movie \"Hustle & Flow\" when they say this new rap song ain't nothing but \"Backdoor Man\" written for modern streets. It's a hip-hop world right now, but I want to bring a little blues to the party.\"\n\nIndeed, Brooks' collaboration with Kapone on \"If It Don't Make Dollars, Then It Don't Make Sense\" shows a streetwise philosophy that could've fit in next to the Three Six Mafia on the \"Hustle & Flow\" soundtrack. On the other hand, Brooks sings like a Memphis soul king on the open-hearted \"Be a Good Man\" a pledge that he'll always try to live honorably and treat his woman with respect.\n\nElsewhere, Brooks shows off his funk chops on \"It's On\" suggesting he's learned a thing or two hanging out with the Prince crew in Minneapolis, while \"You Wrong For That Now\" features the kind of all-out guitar workout that draws on Texas toasters like Freddie King, Johnny Winter and Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\nBrooks flexes his musical muscle at a time when he sees a new vitality being brought to the music through himself, Shemekia Copeland and Bernard Allison. He's convinced this music would be considered as relevant and as powerful as the latest hits by Kanye West or Beyonce Knowles if exposed to young listeners.\n\n\"You can see it in the success blues-influenced players like John Mayer and Jonny Lang have enjoyed,\" Brooks says. \"All they needed was to have their music heard, and people loved it. That's all it will take.\"\n\nBut for all of the varied influences on THE TORCH, the song Brooks is most proud of is \"The Torch of the Blues\", the tune that gave the album its title. The song features Brooks with his father and heroes Eddy Clearwater, Jimmy Johnson and the late Willie Kent, who worked on the session shortly before his death in March 2006.\n\n\"Being there with my dad, Eddy Clearwater, Jimmy Johnson and Willie Kent, all of whom I admire so much, that was a dream come true. We all played our butts off that day and had a blast.\"\n\nBrooks has earned his spot on the front lines. He spent a dozen years backing his father, watching how the master entertainer drew enthusiastic responses night after night. For years, the younger Brooks put his lessons on stage every night, opening his father's show to great response. With his father's blessing, he left the band to strike out on his own shortly after releasing his own debut album, Golddigger in 1998.\n\nLike his father before him, Brooks became a Chicago blues mainstay, playing regularly in Chicago area clubs. After the release of his second album, 2001's Take Me Witcha, he hit the road for what turned out to be a seemingly non-stop three-year tour, picking up devoted new fans all along the way. And while he hadn't planned to take five years between recordings, he did want to do it right. He made up for lost time by packing as many tunes as possible on THE TORCH.\n\n\"The good thing is I had time to test almost all of these songs on an audience and to work them out with the band\", Brooks says. \"We knew what songs people loved, and we got them just the way we want them. It gave us a lot of confidence in the studio knowing that people already loved these songs.\"\n\nIndeed, the album celebrates all that Ronnie Baker Brooks is -- a man with both a legacy and a vision, a man uniquely suited to carry THE TORCH.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Odesza ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9030970.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Chillwave, Electronic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ODESZA returns with its long-anticipated third album, a body of work filled with longing, nostalgia, hope and unity. Titled A Moment Apart, these 16 tracks mark the next step in the evolution of production duo Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight, who have been making music together since their college days at Western Washington University.\n\nThey began their meteoric journey in 2012 with Summer\u2019s Gone, an album they completed near the end of their tenure at Western. It was followed by 2014\u2019s In Return, which debuted at the top of Billboard\u2019s Dance/Electronic charts and featured gold single \u201cSay My Name.\u201d A remix of the track by RAC was later nominated for a Grammy in 2016.\n\nIn the course of that five-year span, they\u2019ve gone from ground zero to selling out large arenas, all without the benefit of mainstream press or radio airplay. They\u2019ve built their appeal through word of mouth and streaming, plus a unique live presentation featuring an 11-piece ensemble that includes a horn section and a marching-band drumline.\n\nA Moment Apart moves into expanded sonic and psychic territory, seamlessly balancing organic and layered synthetic sounds, creating a dreamy, often stirring hybrid that owes as much to Motown and \u201860s surf music as it does to electronic forebears such as Four Tet, M83, Gorillaz and Bonobo.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the duo\u2019s uncanny technical acumen at manipulating sounds that has landed ODESZA in the upper stratum of electronic music. Their immense impact stems from the emotions they elicit from their captured and constructed sounds: the powerful synths, the dynamic chord progressions that open into sweeping cinematic soundscapes and shimmering sonics, punctuated by ecstatic, thumping percussion.\n\nMills and Knight have always been leaders in the revolution of indie electronic music, encompassing a wider, more melodic musical palette and incorporating their own instrumental expertise \u2013 Harrison and Clay play piano, and Clay also plays guitar. On the new album they take their eclecticism one step further, using a stellar range of singers, including Regina Spektor, Leon Bridges, and RY X.\n\nAlso prominent is the exquisite symmetry they\u2019re able to fashion through an unexpected harmony of diverse parts.\n\n\u201cI think our greatest strength is in blending genres,\u201d says Mills, \"be it soul, folk, film scores or electronic\u2026I also think we\u2019re really good at finding sounds that shouldn\u2019t work together and making them fit. I like taking a voice or maybe an instrument, chopping them up into small pieces until they're almost unrecognizable, and mostly incoherent, and then layering them over each other to create a unique tone and sound. It allows us to take pieces from many different styles of music and meld them together to create something that is our own.\u201d\n\nSymmetry and balance is equally important for Knight, who has a degree in physics and math and never planned on pursuing a career in music.\n\n\u201cI was planning on going to grad school for computational finance. What connects that with what I do now always goes back to the idea of symmetry,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen a song is really well done, everything fits. It\u2019s all complementary. Having symmetry in sound is very pleasing to someone\u2019s subconscious. They don\u2019t know why they like it, but they like it. There\u2019s not a specific formula that you can follow, but there are patterns that you can see. Classic tracks that people love have certain distinctive patterns that can be seen across all forms of music. We\u2019re always trying to see what sounds create certain emotive responses.\u201d\n\nMills adds, \u201cWhat I really like about what we do is that we evoke this sense of nostalgia. Nostalgia to me is like instant emotion. I might hear something and think \u2018this reminds me of my childhood.\u2019 Or \u2018this one reminds me of that road trip.\u2019 A lot of times, if we\u2019re making a piano line, we think of something like, \u2018How can we get that warmth of an old soul record?\u2019 Sometimes I think it\u2019s building almost false memories for people. Almost tricking people into thinking that something seems familiar but it really isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe memories this time out often spring from the Northwest, a place where both ODESZA members have lived since childhood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re known for making happy music,\u201d says Knight. \u201cAlthough Harrison is always trying to slip dark stuff into our music. This time he succeeded. Our album isn\u2019t sad \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u201cBut it sees the beauty in those moments\u201d says Mills.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most Northwest album we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d continues Mills. \u201cIt plays to the more overcast days than any of our other music has before. I don\u2019t like pointing out the dark elements without pointing out that the darkness is a positive thing too. That\u2019s the whole point of this album \u2014 and I hate this phrase \u2014 seeing the beauty in the darkness. It\u2019s finding that sad songs can make you really happy. Everyone\u2019s felt sad at some point. I think sometimes we ignore those feelings, and I think part of growing up and getting perspective is being able to see that those things are what life is about, and to appreciate those things even if they are painful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot of longing on this album,\u201d adds Mills. \u201cEspecially \u2018Everything At Your Feet\u2019 which is about a breakup and missing someone and wearing your heart on your sleeve. But all the tracks have an element of longing in them. \u2018Just A Memory,\u2019 with Regina Spektor, certainly. While \u2018Falls\u2019 is about feeling the kinship and community, and realizing that feeling bad about something is actually okay.\u201d\n\nAlternatively pensive, introspective, thoughtful, and triumphant, but ultimately jubilantly anthemic, A Moment Apart nudges listeners through a gamut of the self-discoveries that can only occur when you takes a moment to step outside yourself and look in.\n\n\u201cWe decided to call the album A Moment Apart since it has those darker overtones we hadn\u2019t used before. We were trying to think what represents the time you grow the most, and to me you grow the most in a moment away from all the noise,\u201d explains Mills. \u201cWhen you have a moment to reflect is when you form your strongest opinions and effect your greatest changes and growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the name and the album itself are not so much about isolation as the internal energy, something that happens from within when you step back from everything,\u201d adds Knight.\n\nWhich is something the two of them did after touring relentlessly for the past four years, with few breaks.\n\n\u201cI think about it like being at a party and walking outside and looking out at the moon. That\u2019s a beautiful moment and one you experience by yourself,\u201d adds Mills.\n\n\u201cI remember when we first started out, my goal was to make music I felt like I could dance to and play in my car and still wear my headphones and have a personal experience with,\u201d he continues. \u201cSomething you can put on at a party with your friends, and everyone enjoys it, but also have a very intimate approach with it. That hasn\u2019t changed for me in the past five years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to us to try to evoke emotion, not decide what it is. If they hate it, they hate it. If they love it, then they love it.\n\nKnight and Mills, who write continually, finished the ominous yet euphoric \u201cLine Of Sight\u201d while they were in Australia in April 2016. But the real work on the album began when they got home to Seattle toward the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe really buckled down for the next six or seven months in the ODESZA /Foreign Family Collective studio during the longest, darkest winter I\u2019ve ever experienced in Washington,\u201d says Knight.\n\nBut despite the bleakness of the weather, A Moment Apart is airy and triumphant, filled with possibility and a sense of infectious hope, and an interesting and overweening symmetry.\n\n\u201cWe finished \u2018Intro\u2019 and \u2018Corners Of The Earth\u2019 first, and decided they would be the album\u2019s first and last song,\u201d begins Mills.\n\n\u201cThose two songs embodied what we were hoping the album would turn out to be,\u201d Knight finishes, as is often the case with these two.\n\nThe album represents a well-considered step forward for ODESZA. \u201cOur first album was about discovering our sound,\u201d Mills says. \u201cThe second one was us trying to do something new with it and becoming more songwriters than instrumentalists, and this one was understanding what we do and trying to push it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s ODESZA\u2019s most ambitious album, yet also their most human one, despite the futuristic found sounds and cinematic sweeps and flourishes. Their goals for the album are sonically grand yet surprisingly modest.\n\n\u201cThe album\u2019s really about coming full circle and finding balance in both the sadness and the beauty. But mostly, we just want people to feel something when they listen,\u201d says Mills. \u201cIt\u2019s emotive music.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe album\u2019s about perspective, and it\u2019s about changing your perspective and not looking at something just at surface level. If there\u2019s a theme of the album, that\u2019s it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Lolla From the Vault Livestream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm9fDqfKArM"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Josh Vietti ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10376298.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Jazz, Gospel, Classical, R&b, Pop, Christian/gospel, Hip Hop, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul, Christian-gospel", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Contact Josh Vietti at bookings@joshvietti.com For more information please visit his website: http://www.joshvietti.com https://youtu.be/DXoj5KIyJSo", "otherInfo": "What\u2019s up everybody!

His mother was the maid Maria do Carmo Nascimento. When he was just a few months old, the boy was adopted by the family for whom his mother had previously worked: the couple Josino Brito Campos (a banker, mathematics teacher and electronic technician) and L\u00edlia Silva Campos (a music teacher). He lived in the boroughs of Laranjeiras and Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro. When he was 18 months old, his biological mother died and he moved with his adoptive parents to the city of Tr\u00eas Pontas, in the State of Minas Gerais.\n\nIn the earlier stages of his career, Nascimento played in two samba groups, Evolussamba and Sambacana. In 1963 he moved to Belo Horizonte, and his friendship with the Borges brothers led to the Clube da Esquina (\"corner club\") movement. Other members included Beto Guedes, Toninho Horta, Wagner Tiso, and Flavio Venturini.\n\nNascimento is famous for his chime-clear falsetto and tonal range, as well for highly acclaimed songs such as \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o da Am\u00e9rica (Song from America)\" and \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Estudante (Student's Heart)\". The lyrics of \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Estudante\" remembers the funeral of the student Edson Lu\u00eds, killed by police officers in 1968. The song became the hymn for the diretas J\u00e1 campaign in 1984 and it was also played in the funeral of the late president Tancredo Neves the next year, who died before assuming the presidency.\n\nWhile his reputation within Brazil was firmly established with his Clube da Esquina works, Nascimento's international breakthrough came with his appearance on jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's 1974 album Native Dancer.

Shorter has recorded dozens of albums as a leader, and appeared on dozens more with others. Many of his compositions have become standards.\n\nShorter was born in Newark, New Jersey, and attended Newark Arts High School. He was encouraged by his father to take up the saxophone as a teenager (his brother Alan became a trumpeter). After graduating from New York University in 1956 Shorter spent two years in the US Army, during which time he played briefly with Horace Silver, and after his discharge from the army with Maynard Ferguson.\n\nIn 1959 Shorter joined Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers. He stayed with Blakey for five years, and eventually became musical director for the group. In 1964, Miles Davis persuaded Shorter to leave Blakey and join the Miles Davis Quintet alongside Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. Davis had been searching for a saxophonist to replace John Coltrane for some time, and the new quintet is considered by many to have been Davis's strongest working group. Shorter composed extensively for Davis (\"Prince of Darkness\", \"ESP\", \"Footprints\", \"Sanctuary\", and many others; on some albums he provided half of the compositions).\n\nHerbie Hancock had this to say of Shorter's tenure in the group: \"The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. He still is a master. Wayne was one of the few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed.\" Davis said: \"Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, write the parts for everybody just as he wants them to sound. He also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste.\"\n\nSimultaneously with his time in the Miles Davis quintet, Shorter recorded several albums for Blue Note Records, featuring almost exclusively his own compositions. He also recorded occasionally as a sideman (again, mainly for Blue Note) with Donald Byrd, McCoy Tyner, Grachan Moncur III, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, and band mates Hancock and Williams. Until 1968 he played tenor saxophone exclusively; by the early 1970s, however, he chiefly played soprano saxophone.\n\nShorter remained in Davis's band after the breakup of the quintet in 1968, playing on early jazz fusion recordings including In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew (both 1969). His last live dates and studio recordings with Davis were in 1970.\n\nIn 1970, along with keyboardist Joe Zawinul (also a veteran of the Miles Davis group), Shorter formed Weather Report. Other original members were bassist Miroslav Vitous, percussionist Airto Moreira, and drummer Alphonse Mouzon. Shorter and Zawinul co-led the group until late 1985 with a variety of other musicians, and separately wrote most of Weather Report's material. Shorter also recorded critically acclaimed albums as leader, notably Native Dancer, which featured Brazilian composer and vocalist Milton Nascimento, and Atlantis.\n\nAfter leaving Weather Report, Shorter continued to record and lead groups in jazz fusion styles, and contributed to several albums by Joni Mitchell. He has also maintained an occasional working relationship with Herbie Hancock, including appearances on several of Hancock's albums, the VSOP band (essentially a revival of the 1960s Miles Davis quintet with Freddie Hubbard substituting for Davis), and a tribute album recorded shortly after Davis's death with Hancock, Carter, Williams and Wallace Roney.\n\nShorter formed his current band in 2000, the first permanent acoustic group under his leadership. The quartet is composed of pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade. Two albums of live recordings featuring this quartet have been released (Footprints Live (2001) and Beyond the Sound Barrier (2005)). The quartet has received great acclaim from fans and critics, and the musicians have come to consider themselves family on and off stage. Shorter's 2003 album Alegria received a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album; it features the quartet with a host of other musicians, including pianist Brad Mehldau, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and former Weather Report percussionist Alex Acu\u00f1a.\n\nShorter's wife Ana Maria and their niece Dalila were both killed on TWA Flight 800 in 1996, and he married Carolina Dos Santos, a close friend of Ana Maria, in 1999.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit Jannus Landing, St. Petersburg"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeff Clayborn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10377436.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Country, Outlaw Country, Americana, Southern Rock", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Take a Shot of True Country Music with Jeff Clayborn's New Album GOOD BAR ATTENDER\n\nAuthentically country with a shot of honest-to-goodness musicianship, Jeff Clayborn displays his true artistry in his latest album GOOD BAR ATTENDER.

He\u2019s on a mission to be a passionate voice defining the sound of Jazz in this age while also bringing street cred to the trombone with a bold, tight sound.\n\nBorn into the musical world (Mom Sherry Finzer is an international flutist), Finzer developed a fascination for the music of Duke Ellington and found himself, in high school, performing at the annual Essentially Ellington competition of Jazz at Lincoln Center. It was then that he decided to pursue a life in music himself. His budding talent was recognized by Wycliffe Gordon who began a life-long mentorship by writing four pieces for the young Finzer while he attended the Eastman School of Music. Nick went on to get his masters at Juilliard\u2019s prestigious Jazz program where he was mentored by the trombone legend Steve Turre.\n\nIn 2011 Nick was the winner of the Eastern Trombone Workshop\u2019s National Jazz Trombone Competition and was a finalist in the 2010 International Trombone Association\u2019s Carl Fontana Jazz Trombone Competition.\n\nIn January of 2013 Nick released his recording debut as a bandleader and composer with \u201cExposition\u201d (Outside In Music).

As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nahuel Briones ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Una civilizaci\u00f3n post-humana halla el \u00fanico registro de \"gira musical\" de la Humanidad.\nSe trata de Nahuel Briones compartiendo canciones de todos sus discos y algunos estrenos durante la cuarentena de la que suponen fue la \u00faltima pandemia que azot\u00f3 a la poblaci\u00f3n de la Tierra durante 2020 o 2022 (los cient\u00edficos post-humanos a\u00fan no tiene la certeza del a\u00f1o).\nMaterial in\u00e9dito y exclusivo de investigaci\u00f3n y divulgaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica.\nEl primer streaming de Nahuel Briones para todo el planeta Tierra."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jerry Joseph ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7249633.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock And Roll, Songwriter, Singer, Folk, Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Joseph is a prolific and accomplished songwriter, writing hits for Widespread Panic and releasing 30 albums in his 30+ year career; as a solo artist, with the Jackmormons, supergroup Stockholm Syndrome, his burning two-piece The Denmark Veseys, or originally, with his beloved 80s cult band, Little Women.\n\nJoseph is also a relentless live performer, playing over 150 shows a year across the globe.

Lockwood Porter's Communion in the Ashes is a rallying cry for the hopeless and heartbroken, its lyrics set to a soundtrack of anthemic heartland rock & roll. This is a record that addresses our modern-day social problems from a perspective of hope, encouraging those who listen to focus on activism and community-building rather than despair. Along the way, Porter delivers some of the most engaging, electrifying songs of his career, rooting these melodic calls-to-action in the stomp and epic swagger of a five-piece road band.\n\nBorn into a working-class family in rural Oklahoma, Porter launched his songwriting career after relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area, kicking things off with 2013's Judah's Gone. There, in the nation's most expensive real-estate market, he also taught classes to underprivileged students at an inner-city school, a job that gave him a close-up view of the nation\u2019s growing class divide and its many symptoms, including poverty, gentrification, and homelessness. As his cross-country touring increased, so did the presence of political and social issues within his music, with 2016's How to Dream Again taking influence from the socially-conscious works of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. After writing 2019's Communion in the Ashes, Porter returned to Oklahoma with the goal of contributing to a growing artistic community and, hopefully, affecting social change.\n\n\u201cThe tech boom of the last 10 years has totally transformed the whole Bay Area, and has essentially made it a playground for the rich. Working-class folks and artists aren't welcome there anymore, and this has manifested in rising housing costs, closure of music venues, and the proliferation of homeless tent cities,\u201d Porter divulges. \u201cIn the last verse of the title track, I can see in hindsight that I was saying a \u2018goodbye\u2019 to the Bay Area, even though I didn't know that I'd be leaving at the time.\u201d\n\nWith Communion In The Ashes, Porter crystallizes a sound that is uniquely his own: one that gatecrashes the borders between indie rock & roll, singer/songwriter folk, and Americana. Written alone on the acoustic guitar and recorded with Porter's band during a collaborative, five-day studio session in Chico, CA, the album champions togetherness as an antidote to the immense problems we face as a society. On the kinetic title track, a kick drum bangs out a steady pulse while Porter unveils his game plan: \"When the bridges are all burned, let's congregate the masses, let's hold a new communion in the ashes.\" The song doesn't turn a blind eye to the desperation of today's world; instead, it builds something new from the rubble, transforming desolation into hope. A similar feeling imbues the piano-propelled \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019,\" a secular hymn that nods to Porter's childhood days in the Southern Baptist church. If \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019\" evokes the solemnity of Sunday morning, though, the bulk of Communion in the Ashes rustles up the thrill of Saturday night. There are furiously strummed power chords, pounding percussion, vocal harmonies, and 80s-inspired synthesizers, shot through with a voice that's urgent, compelling, and quick to incite. These are songs about revolution and rebuilding, and Porter sings them accordingly, his voice echoing and rattling its way between the electric guitars and upright piano.\n\nGiven the album's communal emphasis, it's appropriate that Communion in the Ashes is also Porter's most collaborative release. All five band members contributed to the arrangement process, with drummer Peter Labberton pulling triple-duty as the album's engineer and mixer. The band worked swiftly, foregoing rehearsal in favor of instinctual performances and quick studio decisions. \"Get Back to the Wild,\" the one song not recorded live, gave the band a chance to experiment, building a two-bar drum and piano loop into a spiritually-minded song that examines the distance between human nature and human society. Porter and company looked to their own influences for cues, too, with Communion's touchstones running the gamut from Leonard Cohen\u2019s inventive songwriting and Tom Petty's concise melodies to Wilco's experimentation and War on Drugs' gorgeously textured tones. Even so, this is the most distinctive release in M. Lockwood Porter's catalog \u2014 an album that both nods to the past and pushes forward to the future, thanks in part to a full-band attack that lends fire, ferocity, and grit to the tracklist.\n\n\u201cI think the fully collaborative recording process was the biggest musical shift between recording How To Dream Again and Communion In The Ashes,\u201d explains Porter. \u201cJeremy Lyon has been playing in my live band since 2016, but this was the first M. Lockwood Porter album that he\u2019s worked on, and he brought a much wider palette of guitar tones to this album than I've used on past records. This is also the first time I\u2019ve recorded with synthesizers. I had given the band the vague direction that I wanted us to imagine ourselves as a \u2018dystopian gospel band\u2019 before we started recording, and my keyboardist Jeff Hashfield found a sound on his Prophet synthesizer that we ended up dubbing the \u2018Blade Runner church organ.\u2019 We ended up using it on nearly every song.\u201d\n\nThroughout Communion In The Ashes, Porter\u2019s electrifying \u201cdystopian gospel band\u201d explores how frightening our world can be. The record\u2019s enthralling cover art \u2014 designed by William Schaff, known for his longtime association with Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina \u2014 shines a light on that horrifying present, depicting a man (A preacher? An organizer? A demagogue?) addressing a crowd from the foreground of a burning, decaying city. With its Springsteen-sized catharsis, though, Communion in the Ashes offers listeners something new: a soundtrack with which to rise up, rebuild, and renew. Call it protest music if you'd like. Call it a political album if you must. Whatever the description, Communion in the Ashes packs the strongest punch of Porter's career, capturing not just one man's reaction to the present day, but an entire community's opportunity to better their own tomorrows.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jess Meuse ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8963344.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Guitar And Voice, American Country Music, Acoustic, Songwriter, Americana, Alternative, Country Music, Rock, Writer", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Current Highlights:\n\n\u2022 Jessica Meuse - Over 7 million streams of songs on her \"Halfhearted\" album | iTunes Top 10 Country Album\n\n\u2022 \"Love Her Better\" Music Video Receives Seven Film Festival Awards:\n- 2019 San Antonio Film Festival (Official Selection)\n- 2019 WorldFest Houston Film Festival (REMI Winner/Official Selection)\n- 2019 New Hope Film Festival (Official Selection)\n- 2019 Eurovision Palermo Film Festival (Official Selection)\n- 2018 Nevada International Film Festival (Platinum Reel Award Winner)\n- 2018 Laughlin International Film Festival (Official Selection)\n- 2018 Great Lakes International Film Festival (Official Selection)\n\nAbout Jessica Meuse:\n\nJessica Meuse is an American performer from Slapout, Alabama.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

He has been carving out his own space as an unapologetically rock-influenced bluesman and songwriter since first coming to national attention in the late 1990s. Gomes\u2019 new record, Peace, Love & Loud Guitars, is the culmination of a life spent honoring blues traditions while never losing sight of his own identity. He is that rare artist able to take the Zen simplicity of blues music, fuse it with the rush of rock and roll, and write memorable new songs that exist somewhere between creative geniuses Willie Dixon and Billy Gibbons. He stands his ground as a creative artist, not a derivative history lesson, and is eager to push the blues back into the mainstream.\n\nOriginally from Toronto, Canada, Gomes has taken his blues to 17 countries and performed with luminaries like B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Robert Plant, Heart, Sammy Hagar, Joe Bonamassa, .38 Special, Jonny Lang, Robert Cray, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. His high-level guitar, vocal, and songwriting skills have made him one of the top drawing artists in the blues/rock world. His 2015 release Electric Field Holler, debuted at Number Three on the Billboard Blues Chart and he has had five records make the Top Ten there, including 2008\u2019s Live, which debuted at Number One. His song \u201cLove Sweet Love\u201d has racked up over 3.5 million plays on Spotify and was selected by Relix Magazine from more than 40,000 submissions to its song competition for its CD sampler. Clearly, the world is listening.\n\nNot content to only contribute to the blues as a musician, Gomes is also an award-winning scholar of blues history. He earned the University of Toronto\u2019s C.P. Stacey Prize for the highest overall GPA by a history student, completed his Master\u2019s Degree thesis on the racial and cultural evolution of blues music, and graduated with high distinction. His thesis, The Black and White of Blues, was published in 2014 and was nominated for Best Blues Book of the Year by Blues 411.\n\nGomes is a social activist as well, creating the Music Is the Medicine Foundation in 2010 to bring the healing power of music to those who need it. MITM directly assists children with cancer, military veterans with PTSD, and young adults with autism. The Foundation has been awarded grants from State Farm Insurance and CVS Pharmacy and used them to fund songwriting scholarships, donate instruments, and provide music education programs. Gomes believes music is an essential part of the human experience and isn\u2019t afraid to get his hands dirty bringing it to people who could most benefit from its presence in their lives.\n\nPeace, Love, & Loud Guitars is a pivotal release for Anthony Gomes. He is a true believer in the game he plays and the power it contains. He knows he can rock the roadhouse and be smart and relevant at the same time. Now is his time to take the biggest stages of his career and finish the climb he started long ago. Looking for an actual 21st Century guitar hero?

Gros mixes all the sounds of New Orleans - funk, trad jazz, brass band, blues - and makes it his own signature gumbo. His new solo album Central City, shows Gros capturing New Orleans\u2019 distinct feel-good charm with help from some of its\u2019 most renowned players.\n\nGros began playing gigs when he was just fifteen years old but didn\u2019t truly kick off his career until after graduating from Loyola in 1989 with a degree in French Horn performance. During the seminal years that followed, the young man cut his teeth as a solo performer on Bourbon Street while also developing a reputation as a formidable sideman. He backed up some of the biggest names in the Crescent City,: such as Meters bassist George Porter Jr. and guitarist Snooks Eaglin. Studying under mentors decades his senior, Gros absorbed a lifetime of lessons in only a few years and quickly became part of the direct lineage of New Orleans music.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2013, Gros began his transition into the spotlight by leading Papa Grows Funk, a highly revered group that mixed hard-hitting funk grooves with often unpredictable jazz spontaneity. The band released six critically-acclaimed studio albums, including Needle in the Groove, which was co-produced by New Orleans legend and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Allen Toussaint. The group\u2019s weekly gigs at the world-famous Maple Leaf became a staple for both locals and tourists alike, eventually leading to Gros touring in far off countries like Japan and Brazil.\n\nHurricane Katrina\u2019s devastation in 2005 caused Gros to reanalyze his role in the world.\n\n\u201cBefore Katrina, I was simply a New Orleans musician, but after Katrina, I told my story of what New Orleans meant to me and why it is culturally significant to the world. It was at that point I became a New Orleans cultural ambassador, who happens to be a loudmouth, piano-playing, singer-songwriter.\u201d\n\nAfter Papa Grows Funk dissolved, Gros briefly returned to sideman work, playing organ for a series of all-star tributes to Dr. John and the Neville Brothers. The 2014 Dr. John tribute, The Music Mojo of Dr. John, was later released as a critically-acclaimed live album that featured Gros playing with Bruce Springsteen, Mavis Staples, Jason Isbell, and John Fogerty. More importantly for Gros, those tribute concerts allowed him to play alongside his two biggest influences: the Doctor and Art Neville, both of whom passed in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Gros returned to the spotlight yet again with his second solo album River\u2019s On Fire, the much anticipated follow up to his 2004 debut Day\u2019s End. Co-produced by Gros and Tracy Freeman (Harry Connick Jr, Rebirth Brass Band, Bonerama), the album\u2019s fiery funk rock showed how Gros had matured as both a songwriter and bandleader. It firmly established Gros\u2019 identity as a solo force.\n\nNow, Gros is preparing to release Central City, his third solo album. The album is a collection of classic New Orleans songs, both new and old, filtered through his decades of dedication to his craft. The album features Gros\u2019 feel good originals alongside his takes on beloved songs by Allen Toussaint, Lloyd Price, and John Prine. Joining Gros on the album are a who\u2019s who in the keepers of the New Orleans tradition, including singer Ivan Neville (Dumpstaphunk), drummer Herlin Riley (Wynton Marsalis), banjoist Don Vappie, guitarist Brian Stoltz (Neville Brothers), trumpeter Mark Braud (Harry Connick Jr.), trombonist Mark Mullins (Bonerama), clarinetist Tim Laughlin, and his former boss George Porter Jr. (Meters).

During the seminal years that followed, the young man cut his teeth as a solo performer on Bourbon Street while also developing a reputation as a formidable sideman. He backed up some of the biggest names in the Crescent City,: such as Meters bassist George Porter Jr. and guitarist Snooks Eaglin. Studying under mentors decades his senior, Gros absorbed a lifetime of lessons in only a few years and quickly became part of the direct lineage of New Orleans music.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2013, Gros began his transition into the spotlight by leading Papa Grows Funk, a highly revered group that mixed hard-hitting funk grooves with often unpredictable jazz spontaneity. The band released six critically-acclaimed studio albums, including Needle in the Groove, which was co-produced by New Orleans legend and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Allen Toussaint. The group\u2019s weekly gigs at the world-famous Maple Leaf became a staple for both locals and tourists alike, eventually leading to Gros touring in far off countries like Japan and Brazil.\n\nHurricane Katrina\u2019s devastation in 2005 caused Gros to reanalyze his role in the world.\n\n\u201cBefore Katrina, I was simply a New Orleans musician, but after Katrina, I told my story of what New Orleans meant to me and why it is culturally significant to the world. It was at that point I became a New Orleans cultural ambassador, who happens to be a loudmouth, piano-playing, singer-songwriter.\u201d\n\nAfter Papa Grows Funk dissolved, Gros briefly returned to sideman work, playing organ for a series of all-star tributes to Dr. John and the Neville Brothers. The 2014 Dr. John tribute, The Music Mojo of Dr. John, was later released as a critically-acclaimed live album that featured Gros playing with Bruce Springsteen, Mavis Staples, Jason Isbell, and John Fogerty. More importantly for Gros, those tribute concerts allowed him to play alongside his two biggest influences: the Doctor and Art Neville, both of whom passed in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Gros returned to the spotlight yet again with his second solo album River\u2019s On Fire, the much anticipated follow up to his 2004 debut Day\u2019s End. Co-produced by Gros and Tracy Freeman (Harry Connick Jr, Rebirth Brass Band, Bonerama), the album\u2019s fiery funk rock showed how Gros had matured as both a songwriter and bandleader. It firmly established Gros\u2019 identity as a solo force.\n\nNow, Gros is preparing to release Central City, his third solo album. The album is a collection of classic New Orleans songs, both new and old, filtered through his decades of dedication to his craft. The album features Gros\u2019 feel good originals alongside his takes on beloved songs by Allen Toussaint, Lloyd Price, and John Prine. Joining Gros on the album are a who\u2019s who in the keepers of the New Orleans tradition, including singer Ivan Neville (Dumpstaphunk), drummer Herlin Riley (Wynton Marsalis), banjoist Don Vappie, guitarist Brian Stoltz (Neville Brothers), trumpeter Mark Braud (Harry Connick Jr.), trombonist Mark Mullins (Bonerama), clarinetist Tim Laughlin, and his former boss George Porter Jr. (Meters).

He has been carving out his own space as an unapologetically rock-influenced bluesman and songwriter since first coming to national attention in the late 1990s. Gomes\u2019 new record, Peace, Love & Loud Guitars, is the culmination of a life spent honoring blues traditions while never losing sight of his own identity. He is that rare artist able to take the Zen simplicity of blues music, fuse it with the rush of rock and roll, and write memorable new songs that exist somewhere between creative geniuses Willie Dixon and Billy Gibbons. He stands his ground as a creative artist, not a derivative history lesson, and is eager to push the blues back into the mainstream.\n\nOriginally from Toronto, Canada, Gomes has taken his blues to 17 countries and performed with luminaries like B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Robert Plant, Heart, Sammy Hagar, Joe Bonamassa, .38 Special, Jonny Lang, Robert Cray, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. His high-level guitar, vocal, and songwriting skills have made him one of the top drawing artists in the blues/rock world. His 2015 release Electric Field Holler, debuted at Number Three on the Billboard Blues Chart and he has had five records make the Top Ten there, including 2008\u2019s Live, which debuted at Number One. His song \u201cLove Sweet Love\u201d has racked up over 3.5 million plays on Spotify and was selected by Relix Magazine from more than 40,000 submissions to its song competition for its CD sampler. Clearly, the world is listening.\n\nNot content to only contribute to the blues as a musician, Gomes is also an award-winning scholar of blues history. He earned the University of Toronto\u2019s C.P. Stacey Prize for the highest overall GPA by a history student, completed his Master\u2019s Degree thesis on the racial and cultural evolution of blues music, and graduated with high distinction. His thesis, The Black and White of Blues, was published in 2014 and was nominated for Best Blues Book of the Year by Blues 411.\n\nGomes is a social activist as well, creating the Music Is the Medicine Foundation in 2010 to bring the healing power of music to those who need it. MITM directly assists children with cancer, military veterans with PTSD, and young adults with autism. The Foundation has been awarded grants from State Farm Insurance and CVS Pharmacy and used them to fund songwriting scholarships, donate instruments, and provide music education programs. Gomes believes music is an essential part of the human experience and isn\u2019t afraid to get his hands dirty bringing it to people who could most benefit from its presence in their lives.\n\nPeace, Love, & Loud Guitars is a pivotal release for Anthony Gomes. He is a true believer in the game he plays and the power it contains. He knows he can rock the roadhouse and be smart and relevant at the same time. Now is his time to take the biggest stages of his career and finish the climb he started long ago. Looking for an actual 21st Century guitar hero?

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service. In the upcoming months, fans also have the opportunity to pledge support on Patreon or Bandcamp and receive access to the private Sayla Dobro social feed, an array of special \"awards\", and even a live performance at their own home or business.", "otherInfo": "Live Dobro, electric and acoustic guitar, singing to tracks.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "V TORRES ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8786510.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from Southern California, V Torres has spent her entire life in or around music and sports.

While this uncanny ability to reach back into time and bring new music forth can sometimes result in anachronisms, Heyer has done something truly amazing on his first solo album. On Sweet Action Heyer has found his home. He is rarely assisted on the album\u2019s eight tracks, but left alone with his own imagination Heyer\u2019s classic rock dream has come true. There isn\u2019t a weak track on the album, and Heyer\u2019s voice is stronger than ever. Sweet Action opens with the delicious mid century ring of vibraphone and roiling snare. Heyer quickly establishes a psychedelic feel\u2013somewhere between Bowie\u2018s Space Oddity and Floyd\u2018s Dark Side\u2013 and the album is instantly established as an orchestra you\u2019re allowed to play loud. The psych-rock freak out, one of Heyer\u2019s trademarks, comes faithfully on the next track. With that out of the way he breaks into a honky-tonk in the style of Lovin Spoonful\u2018s \u201cNashville Cats\u201d called \u201cHideaway.\u201d Stumbling on a rock record like this is like meeting an old friend, then realizing what it is about them you missed. The songs continue to fall out of Heyer just so, building a brick-and-mortar solid album without weakness. \u201cSong for the Top of the Mountain\u201d is as epic as its title suggests: triumphant guitar escalates up an epic track to the sound of marching drums. \u201cGhostly Glow\u201d is perhaps the album\u2019s best song, like an \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d that trades acoustic arpeggio for damn depressing cello, and lays down some supernatural allegory about perspective. Heyer\u2019s nimble mastery over the guitar can be experienced in full on \u201cThe Letter.\u201d Perfect strums trade bars with scale runs in a song so strikingly beautiful you almost don\u2019t notice how good his singing is. The album finishes as strong as it begins, with RL begging introspection on \u201cParadise\u201d and giving hindsight advice on \u201cFlannel.\u201d - Sean Jewell, American Standard Time Hard rock. 4-part vocal harmonies.

The depths of her voice unlimited, she is already a fast festival favourite.\n\nKaren has that rare gift to communicate the unspeakable. Cameron Adams, from the Herald Sun, says, \u201cMs Andrews has one of those authentic sounds you hear. You can tell she has lived and loved.\u201d Her sensibility allows the audience to surrender to the music; the experience is mutually warm and commanding.

She manages to be both imperial yet vulnerable.\u201d\n\nKaren had to know how to get the best from every instrument, every singer. To do so, she called upon the music she loved as a young girl \u2013 Soul. Blues and Gospel. In the crowded Andrews family home in Koonawarra, a young Karen listened to her brother\u2019s Motown records and the satin voice of Stevie Wonder. Singing along to those golden hits, and traditional Polynesian songs, was merely part of everyday family life; This would become the foundation of her original style \u2013 Oceanic Blues.\n\nOceanic Blues is the newest sub-genre of the Blues. Oceania\u2019s narrative tradition and the introduction of American Blues, Soul and Gospel since the 1960s, has shaped this distinctive style. The roots of the sound are gritty guitar, glowing valves, lush tremolo and deep reverb in a distinctively fluid Oceanic expression. This sound carries the mood and tones of Oceania expressed in rich, warm vocal tones.\n\nKaren Lee Andrews debuts her new sound and EP \u201cFar from Paradise\u201d.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label. Two Tomatoes moved into a real office in New York City, with real staff including Shannon Chirone, John Waldman (Great Knight Productions), Corinne Barlow, Katie Messer, Michelle Puskas, Justice Longshore, and publicist Elizabeth Waldman Frazier.\n\nIt's one big happy family!", "otherInfo": "Laurie Berkner is doing daily Facebook lives during the COVID-19 school and community closures.

Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label.
