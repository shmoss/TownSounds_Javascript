While learning Hill Country Blues (RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, Mississippi Fred McDowell) firsthand in North Mississippi, he founded his blues-rock trio \u201cTURCHI,\u201d which released its debut album Road Ends in Water in 2012. Called \"everything a blues fan could want\" (LA Examiner), the album featured guest Luther Dickinson on three tracks. After a series of national tours, TURCHI released Live in Lafayette in early 2013, and exploded on the blues-rock scene, notably earning high praise from Living Blues Magazine (\"for all of their communion with the past, TURCHI sounds vital, alive, and essential\"), landing on the cover of Buscadero (Italy) and being showcased in a five-page feature in Il Blues Magazine (Italy). At that point, TURCHI\u2019s national touring grew to include Europe, highlighted with a headlining spot at Mojo Festival (Rome) in June 2014 after the release of Can\u2019t Bury Your Past, which expanded the trio with keyboards/organ (Anthony Farrell) and saxophone (Art Edmaiston). Also in 2014, stemming from his tours in Italy, Reed began collaborating with renowned Italian guitarist Adriano Viterbini, leading to Scrapyard, an intimate, intense, guitar duo album recorded in Memphis and in Rome. Called \"a marvelous example of talent and simplicity\" (Bluebird Reviews, UK), the album earned a editor\u2019s feature from iTunes (\"blues chemistry overflowing with earthy delta slide and dark pulsing electric guitar\"), and a spot on Tidal\u2019s \u201ceditor\u2019s playlist.\u201d At around the same time, seeking new inspirations and sounds, Reed moved from Western North Carolina to Memphis, where he began digging into the trademark rhythms and styles that made the music from Stax and Muscle Shoals groove so powerful. It was a time of personal and musical change, leading Reed to disband TURCHI with the release of sendoff EP We Spoke in Song, recorded at an old JC Penney in Richmond VA amidst their final performances in October 2014. As they toured in support of Scrapyard in Europe and the US, Adriano introduced Reed to Tuareg music (Tinariwen, Bombino, Terakaft). Back in Memphis, Reed wrote songs with a new sound and band in mind, and began recording at Ardent Studios in April 2015. The result, Speaking in Shadows, will be released March 4th 2016 on Devil Down Records. Revealing musical and songwriting influences ranging from Randy Newman and JJ Cale to Beck, T Rex, and Tinariwen, Reed steps out from behind the gruff fuzz into a multi-faceted sound built on finely crafted songs and ear- & rear-moving grooves. Featuring an all-star group of musicians including drummer/bassist Paul Taylor, saxophonist Art Edmaiston, Andrew Trube and Anthony Farrell (Greyhounds), and Adriano Viterbini, Speaking in Shadows is built on a foundation of Memphis groove and fat-back rhythm. Fresh textures abound, from the carnival of sounds on tongue-in-cheek \u201cDrawn and Quartered\u201d to the heartbreaking vocals of Heather Moulder on the spare, haunting lead track \u201cPass Me Over.\u201d As a songwriter, Turchi confidently mines the classic blues/rock vein in \"Offamymind\" (\"Well I can barely walk, so I guess I oughta/ Get behind this wheel and drive\u201d), effortlessly shifts gears to the satirical \"Everybody's Waiting (for the end to come),\" and turns introspective in \"Looking Up Past Midnight.\" Reuniting with engineer Adam Hill (Big Star, Dirty Streets, White Stripes), Reed strikes out for new territory with co-production by Billy Bennett (MGMT, Drive-By Truckers, Los Colognes). The album was mastered by Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes, Natural Child, The Whigs) at Bombshelter Studios in East Nashville, with artwork and design from Charles Ritchie. To implement the new album's sound live, Reed assembled The Caterwauls: Memphis drummer Andrew McNeill; Murfreesboro, TN-based slide guitarist Joey Fletcher; and Woodsbury, TN singer / piano player Heather Moulder. The Caterwauls combine soul, funk, rock, country, and gospel, creating deep grooving rhythms. Reed and The Caterwauls are preparing for a busy 2016, and the launch of Speaking in Shadows.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE.

He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Once again I find myself almost at a loss for words other than to say if you\u2019ve never listened to The Tea Club you MUST check them out. They get my highest recommendation...\"\n-Jerry Lucky, author of \"The Progressive Rock Files\"\n\n\"...The Tea Club are the real prog rock deal...\"\n-The Organ 'Zine\n\n\"One of the best progressive rock records this side of 1975... Truly a must listen for pretty much everyone that likes anything even remotely progressive related...\"\n-Kevin Zecchel, The Monolith\n\n\u201c...If you resurrected Poe and Lovecraft, gave them guitars and synthesizers and called them a band, then set them loose on the world, you probably still wouldn\u2019t get a cast of characters as unique, twisted, and fantastical as Dr. Abraham, Simon Magus, The Eternal German Infant, and Big Al.

He recorded an all-instrumental demo CD called The One-Man String Quartet which got airplay on Keller Williams' nationally syndicated radio show Keller's Cellar, as well as on Derk Richardson's Hear and Now show on KPFA in Berkeley.\n\nIn 2005 he formed the Adrian West Trio and in 2010 he released his first full-length CD Chameleons and Butterflies.\n\nSince then the band has performed at small venues and festivals all over the Bay Area.\n\nRecently Adrian combined his love of music with his love of science in a multimedia show called An Evening of Music & Science which weaves his music with synchronized videos and presentations on the subject of how life began on Earth.

Their music serves to make introspection and human connection sexy again. Pr\u00f3xima Parada is releasing new music and will embark on their first U.S. tour this year.\n\nTheir last single, Time In A Circle, currently has over 1,500,000 plays on Spotify alone.\n\nStarting in 2012 as a group of college friends wanting to extend their dynamic to their community in San Luis Obispo, CA, they never dreamed that their passion would reach a global audience, that they'd perform at beautiful historic venues and music festivals, that their songs would earn awards, that their music would soothe and uplift people around the world.\n\n\nThe starting lineup for Pr\u00f3xima Parada:\nNick Larson (vocals, keys, guitar), Kevin Middlekauff (bass), Josh Collins (guitar), and Aaron Kroeger (drums).\n\nA BETTER BIO:\n\nThe following recount of the epic of Pr\u00f3xima Parada was translated from ancient Greek dactylic hexameter and is traditionally attributed to Sophocles (although recent investigations by way of modern advancements hypothesize the text as a discarded fragment of Homer's Iliad):\n\nIt all emerged from the discovery of freedom way back when. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, protector of goslings, formed as a result of a murmur, a moo moo, the recitation of a Nordic dirge, and a desperate whimper; sounds heard all the way down to the Mississippi Delta, which had long been shining like a National guitar. Though the individuals of Pr\u00f3xima Parada were all ephemeral in flesh, their collective offering of goodwill in the aural realm became immortal by wish of the gods.\n\nOn Olympus resounded a long, deep breath of agreeable relief, as the gods delivered their most interesting gift for Earth, Kevin Middlekauff, enchanter of the four stringed bass lyre, son of Leto of the Lovely Locks, to whom they gave the patience of the Bald Eagle along with his fierce talons, which made plucking strings a markedly difficult task. With him came a fleet of Achaean spearwomen. Enrapt in observing a quarrel between armies of men, the gods let fall a quiver of divine arrows, and the jumble that fused upon an unforgiving collision of earth and oxen created many a Nicholas Larson, bleak souls with shrill voices. One Nicholas was given the great fortune of finding Kevin, who guided him through wind and sea away from a shameful life as a lotus eater and taught him the Seikilos epitaph (\"While you live, shine / have no grief at all / life exists only for a short while / and time demands an end\").\n\nJoshua Collins\u2019 lineage cannot be enumerated with exactitude, although Agamemnon, supreme commander of the Achaean armies, was informed by an oracle that Joshua was the end result of an abandoned beard. How he and his young fur joined Pr\u00f3xima Parada is even less understood.\n\nFollowing a fortnight of arrows raining from both armies, Apollo ceased his observations of Troy to ponder a creation forming in the northern reaches from the percussion of glaciers striking Galdh\u00f8piggen, Scandinavia\u2019s boldest mountain. Savage ice and rock had been warring for ages. Apollo, to establish consonance in that great region, sent Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, king of Mycenae in the Peloponnese, hiker of short pants. Aaron percussed the earth with his dual gold-bestudded sceptres to instruct the sun of the tempo of the day and the moon of the night\u2019s gloom. Satisfied in frigid Norden, he prepared himself to settle in asceticism for the rest of his days.\n\nNot before long, under the tutelage of Olympus, the three boys became something akin to men and the silence turned to harmony, harmony that spread through the yellow hair of Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, into his ears, and reverberated in his heart. Having never been moved so by man, he vowed to percuss alongside the sounds of the three. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, the amalgamation of the four regions of Nether, was erected in January of 2012 of the Gregorian Calendar, although The China National Petroleum Corporation would soon change their fiscal calendar to mark Pr\u00f3xima\u2019s birth as year 0.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Emily Chambers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9318276.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, Soul, Contemporary R&B, Neo-Soul", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "SoFar Sounds San Francisco", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Madison Kozak", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9347858.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "A native of rural Ontario, Canada, rising Country singer-songwriter Madison Kozak is turning\nheads with her brand-new track \u201cFirst Last Name.\u201d The song is inspired by her relationship with\nher father, who introduced her to Country greats including Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline and Johnny\nCash.

The tracks are flooded with the joys and sorrows of everyday life, given wing by the record\u2019s vibrant production and melodies that will haunt you, even after a single listen.\n\nThe duo has been thrilling audiences in their hometown of Portland since they began performing together six years ago.

Apart from C-Bo and horrorcore forefather Brotha Lynch Hung, few can name one rapper from California\u2019s capital. Mozzy (Timothy Patterson) is rapidly redirecting the discussion. His hardened gangster narratives eschew the exaggerated violence of horrorcore, favoring the kind of terrifying front line reportage verified by police reports and far too many headstones. Hailing from Oak Park, one of the city\u2019s most dangerous and disenfranchised neighborhoods, Mozzy is a voice for and an inspiration to friends, family, and fellow citizens. His inventive slang, vivid diction, and visceral emotion have made the 28-year-old a local star, and his music videos have racked up millions of YouTube views without outside help. His recent works have been heralded by distinguished publications like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone, which placed 2015's Bladadah on its \u201c40 Best Rap Albums of 2015\u201d list. While Mozzy, Sacramento, and Oak Park are already synonymous, they will soon be ubiquitous. Like most Oak Park denizens, the odds were stacked against Mozzy from birth. Born to a felon father and dope-addicted mother, his grandmother and several aunts raised him. The former instilled his unwavering work ethic while the latter inspired his interest in rap. \u201cMy aunts used to listen to the music videos on BET. I recorded them and played them over and over,\u201d Mozzy says. \u201cSnoop Dogg, 2Pac, Death Row, and No Limit--they were my influences.\u201d Writing rhymes and rapping since the age of six, Mozzy performed at talent shows in his preteens and was featured on locally renowned rap albums. Unfortunately, gang life also colored his youth. Friends were lost to decade-long wars and Mozzy was consumed by the crossfire. \u201cI was forced into it. It wasn\u2019t a part of my playbook,\u201d he explains, citing several family members who were affiliated with gangs. \u201cIt just naturally happened.\u201d For years, Mozzy engaged in gang activity and sold narcotics concurrently. Still, writing and recording music was paramount, both a constant source of catharsis and a road to redemption. When he went to jail in 2014, he used his phone calls to orchestrate the release of already recorded albums and videos. In 2015, he released four independent albums (Gangland Landscape, Bladadah, Yellow Tape Activities, Down the Wire: 4th Ave Edition) and several collaborative projects. \u201cI live in the studio,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m putting one in my house so I can literally live in it.\u201d While his early material was riddled with emptied clips and closed caskets, recent albums, like 2016\u2019s Beautiful Struggle, display marked growth. The horrifying has become sobering, and the aggression has been supplanted by somber reflection. A proud and protective father who spent months fighting for the custody of his three-year-old daughter, Mozzy articulates personal and societal tragedies as much as he hopes to prevent them. \u201cOnce upon a time, I didn\u2019t talk about nothing but murder, selling drugs, and crazy shit,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you listen to my music now, it\u2019s about the consequences of this shit.\u201d Now splitting time between L.A. and Sacramento, Mozzy is awaiting the release of his next album, Mandatory Check. In addition to features from Rich Homie Quan, IamSu, and the late Bay legend Jacka, the project showcases the talent of Mozzy\u2019s closest compatriots (e.g. E Mozzy, Kunta) and his longtime go-to producer, June on the Beat. Still, the story belongs to Mozzy. Tales of retribution temper requiems for fallen friends. The pain of the past illuminates the profundity of newfound success. Throughout, he utilizes his singular Oak Park slang (e.g. yeeky, bladadah, blamatory), artful wordplay, and inimitable conversational flow. There are no radio friendly singles on the album, but Mozzy isn\u2019t concerned. He only cares about his fans, the people who are still dealing with the hardships that rap has helped him escape.

Do I want people to understand me and know me, do I want to tell them my story? I\u2019m very private, but my favorite work is when people are being honest and really doing themselves.\u201d\n\nAs the frontwoman and guitarist for Alabama Shakes, Howard has become one of music\u2019s most celebrated figures\u2014the band has won four Grammys (out of its nine nominations), and she has performed everywhere from the Obama White House to the main stage at Lollapalooza, where she sang with Paul McCartney at his invitation. But for her solo debut, Jaime, Howard boldly decided to explore new directions, with diverse instrumentation and arrangements and intimate, revelatory lyrics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary to mess with success, because the Shakes are doing so good,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I needed to shake it up\u2014and if you\u2019re going to do that, you better go all out and make it worth it.\u201d\n\nHoward had amassed a bunch of ideas and song scraps, things that felt like they were outside the realm of the band. Her plans weren\u2019t clear for these incomplete tracks, which were mostly recorded alone on her laptop and given temporary, random titles\u2014making it challenging to even locate them later.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something on my own, just my music, that didn\u2019t have to have a genre or stick to fans\u2019 expectations,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew I wanted to do a record, but I didn\u2019t know where to begin. I was freaking out, I didn\u2019t know what to sing or what it would sound like. I was writing every day, putting all this stress on myself, hoping something would happen.\u201d\n\nIn search of inspiration, Howard left her home in Nashville and went to Topanga Canyon for a change of scenery. \u201cI was staying in this beautiful place and I was miserable because the songs just weren\u2019t coming,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen she eventually went into engineer Shawn Everett\u2019s studio in Los Angeles to record, she only had a handful of finished songs. But once she started working with the band she had assembled\u2014a core group of Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell (\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since we were kids,\u201d she says, \u201cso working with another bass player seemed ludicrous\u201d), innovative jazz-based keyboard player Robert Glasper, and drummer Nate Smith\u2014Howard started to feel the music taking shape, sometimes out of their playing and sometimes simply out of conversations.\n\n\u201cI had forgotten some of these songs even existed,\u201d Howard says with a laugh. \u201c\u2019History Repeats\u2019 took forever to mix because it\u2019s the original from my Logic recording, which I had recorded vocals on just to show my friend how the program worked and then forgot about it. The vocal on \u2018Run to Me\u2019 was recorded on a cell phone!\u201d\n\nThe work Howard has done with her side bands, Thunderbitch and Bermuda Triangle, also impacted her ambitions for the songs on Jaime. \u201cThe Shakes do a cycle of recording and touring, and then I get restless in the time off,\u201d she says. \u201cActually, to me, there is no time off\u2014I\u2019m a creative person and I need to create or I just feel weird, not fully human.\n\n\u201cWith Bermuda Triangle,\u201d she continues, \u201cI learned about raising my own voice. The other girls had their own songs, they could just play them on an acoustic guitar and they didn\u2019t need a band. My music is really composed, with lots of moving pieces, so that inspired me to really pay more attention to what I write and try to be a better songwriter.\u201d\n\nDifferent sounds and approaches started to emerge. Howard plays all the parts on \u201cShort and Sweet,\u201d while \u201cPresence\u201d sees her accompanied only by a harp. \u201c13th Century Metal\u201d grew out of Glasper and Smith jamming in the studio\u2014\u201cI heard that and knew I had to do something with it,\u201d she says.\n\nEven more striking, though, are the stories Howard is telling on Jaime, the deeply personal and emotional territory she covers directly and nakedly, stripped of overtly poetic distance. She confronts harsh truths about relationships in songs like \u201cBaby\u201d and \u201cTomorrow\u201d and examines spiritual ritual in \u201cHe Loves Me.\u201d\n\nHoward points to \u201cGeorgia\u201d as a breakthrough song on the project, and for herself. \u201cThat\u2019s a straightforward love song to another woman, which is something I never confronted until I was older,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a small town like where I come from, different is bad\u2014I never wanted to be different. My greatest wish was to be like everybody else. I didn\u2019t want to be almost six feet tall, didn\u2019t want this big, bushy hair. That\u2019s the truth of what it feels like to hold everything in and just want to be accepted for being yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoat Head\u201d is a painfully candid account of Howard\u2019s family experience when she was growing up as a mixed-race child in a small Southern town. \u201cIt\u2019s a story my mom told me when I was 13 or 14,\u201d she says, \u201cabout how it was really hard to have little brown babies, how hard it was raising us. I never saw our town that way, never experienced it because I was too young, but it explained so much about my mom\u2014why she was always so stressed, had so much trouble getting a job.\n\n\u201cWhen I sang it, I instantly felt afraid, embarrassed, vulnerable. I was definitely scared for the sake of my folks, bringing up bad memories, But it is my story to tell\u2014that song was the experience of growing up in the South.\u201d\n\nHoward titled the album after her sister, who taught her to play the piano and write poetry, and who died of cancer when they were still teenagers. \u201cThe title is in memoriam, and she definitely did shape me as a human being,\u201d says Howard. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about me\u2014the people who know me well know how important she is to me.\u201d\n\nAs the first project to come out under Brittany Howard\u2019s own name, Jaime represents an enormous step both musically and personally. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time making decisions on my own, being the captain of the ship,\u201d she says. \u201cIt brings up existential questions\u2014why am I here, why do I do this? People think that touring in a band is super-fun, and it can be, but nothing about it is normal. You miss out on a lot of stuff, so I need to make sure I\u2019m doing it for the right reasons.\u201d\n\nHoward looks forward to playing these songs live, but is tempering her expectations. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cI have to measure my success by the fact that I did something I didn\u2019t think I could do\u2014I knew I could, but I didn\u2019t know if I would. So just the fact that I made it, and gave myself permission to just fuck it up and do some stuff that\u2019s maybe stupid and not cool, is pretty successful. Being a creative person, that\u2019s the most successful thing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Bent Knee", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9368581.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: Experimental, Art Rock, Indie, Indie Rock, Avant-Garde, Rock, Experimental Rock, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "A band occupying sonic territory entirely their own, Bent Knee continues to break ground with each successive album, a record maintained with 2019\u2019s extraordinary \"You Know What They Mean\".

Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others.

The result is an ironically harmonious blend Jenna refers to as the New West. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of old and new, keeping tradition but being apart of the modern world,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a representation of the two worlds I grew up in - a balance of the two. My mom\u2019s side is ranching; my dad\u2019s side is the big city sales-type. In everything I do, the way I dress, write, perform, even cook - my entire self is the New West.\u201d Surprising to many, considering her love of ranching,\n\nJenna made the move to attend the Savannah College of Art and Design on a singing scholarship \u2013 the decision just another insight into her two worlds. \u201cIt was during college I realized I wanted to do country music. I got my degree in visual communications (advertising and graphic design) after hearing that Kenny Chesney had gotten his degree in advertising - I admired the brand he had created for himself. I wanted to understand how to properly position myself as a country artist. I made friends on campus who are each amazing at what they do in styling, branding and other fields. Now they work with me on my career. It\u2019s the biggest blessing to have people that truly know you help develop you.\u201d\n\nAfter college, Jenna moved to Nashville, and last year she enlisted the help of producers Brad Hill (Maren Morris, Brothers Osborne) and Lee Holland. The result of the collaboration is the sound of Jenna\u2019s New West. \u201cIt has this traditional feel with a clean modern twist. I went into the project wanting pop rhythms, mandolin for texture, but for pedal steel to be the leading lady. I\u2019m a big George Strait fan, and in every song I\u2019ve ever loved, the pedal steel sent shivers down my back.\u201d Her debut single, Coolest Girl in the World, is a prime example of that. Co- written by Jenna, Jordan Reynolds (Keith Urban, \u201cGetting in the Way\u201d; Lauren Alaina, \u201cThree\u201d) and Sydney Cubit, Jenna\u2019s effortless conversational vocal on the up-tempo tune delivers a message everyone can relate to. \u201cYou\u2019re either the guy, wanting to make the girl feel like she\u2019s the girl in the song on the radio, or you\u2019re the girl, wishing you were one of the \u2018girls they sing about.\u2019\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "13160 CA-9, Boulder Creek, CA 95006", "Artist": "Julien Kozak", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.121327, 37.124938], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "lille \u00e6ske", "moreBioInfo": "Julien Kozak is a 25-year-old singer/songwriter from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

When the band formed in the early 1970s, little did they know they would set the standard for hard rock bands that trailed. Many of the biggest acts of the '80s became popular opening for headliners Y&T\u2014and cut their teeth on the band, as evidenced by the Y&T mentions in tell-all books by acts such as Metallica and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.\n\nBorn in Oakland, California, Y&T is one of the San Francisco Bay Area's own innovators of the hard rock sound. World-renowned headliners on their own, the band also remained the most requested support act on the hard rock road, touring with icons Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC, Aerosmith, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, and more. Whether performing to a festival crowd of fifty-thousand or in an intimate nightclub, Y&T's high-energy set still captivates legions of fans around the globe, proving Y&T's music timeless.\n\nOriginally formed as Yesterday and Today, the initial powerhouse quartet\u2014featuring Dave Meniketti (lead guitar/lead vocals), Phil Kennemore (bass), Leonard Haze (drums), and Joey Alves (rhythm guitar)\u2014tore through the '70s and '80s with their own brand of hard rock. After two '70s albums on London Records, they shortened their name to Y&T and released eight albums on A&M in the '80s. Two more albums with Geffen Records marked an era of change with Jimmy DeGrasso (Alice Cooper, Suicidal Tendencies, Megadeth) on drums and Stef Burns (Alice Cooper, Berlin, Huey Lewis) on guitar.\n\nWith a discography of 18 albums and three greatest hits collections, Y&T has sold over four million albums since their 1974 inception. The band received extensive airplay with hits such as Forever, Rescue Me, Mean Streak, and Summertime Girls\u2014which played in heavy rotation on MTV. Y&T songs have been featured in a multitude of movies and television shows, including Real Genius, Out of Bounds, Baywatch, and Hunter. After five top 100 albums, songs that tipped into the 40s, two Bammie Awards, and many international television appearances, Y&T's hits are still played on VH1 Classic and classic rock radio stations everywhere.\n\nIn 2010, Y&T released their first studio album in 13 years, featuring original members Dave Meniketti and Phil Kennemore, along with longtime members John Nymann on guitar and Mike Vanderhule on drums, who were each hand-picked by Kennemore and Meniketti years earlier. As the title indicates, Facemelter is a hard rockin', song-oriented album that lives up to its name. Recorded mostly live in the studio, it captures the band's raw energy and tightness for which they've become known. Featuring heavy grooves, powerful guitars and strong melodies, the band shows their versatility, delivering a range of high-energy rockers, mid-tempo head-bangers, modern rock grooves, majestic ballads, and signature Y&T rock anthems.\n\nAfter a show in the mid-'70s, a rabid fan told the band, \u201cYou melted my face.\u201d And as any Y&T fan will testify still today, Y&T's strong suit lies in their high-energy, power-packed rock 'n' roll set.\n\nWith Kennemore's untimely passing from lung cancer, the band carries on the legacy that is Y&T. Y&T continues to tour the world, featuring Dave Meniketti (guitar/lead vocals), John Nymann (guitar/vocals), Aaron Leigh (bass/vocals), and Mike Vanderhule (drums/vocals), playing songs from Facemelter as well as all the hits and fan favorites.

The New York Times described Smith as \u201ca firecracker of a drummer.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s rising career reaches a new benchmark with the release of his bandleader debut, KINFOLK: Postcards from Everywhere, on which he fuses his original modern jazz compositions with R&B, pop, and hip-hop. The disc shows Smith leading a scintillating core ensemble, consisting of pianist and keyboardist Kris Bowers, guitarist Jeremy Most, alto and soprano saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, electric bassist Fima Ephron, and singer and lyricist Amma Whatt, and Michael Mayo on backing vocals. The lineup expands on several cuts with the inclusion of Potter and Holland along with other illustrious guests \u2013 guitarists Lionel Loueke and Adam Rogers, and singer Gretchen Parlato.\n\nAs the title KINFOLK suggests, the music bristles with a magnetism that can be only achieved by assembling the right musicians, building upon and blending their individual voices and developing a bracing group rapport. Indeed, Smith refers to the aforementioned musicians as \u201ckindred spirits,\u201d while embracing some philosophies gleaned from his mentor, Holland. \u201cDave once told me, \u2018I really believe that musicians find each other,\u2019\u201d Smith recalls. \u201cHe feels that all the collaborations he\u2019s done and all the sidemen that he\u2019s hired came into his life on purpose, even though he might not have been looking for something specific. He discovers people along the way.\n\n\u201cKINFOLK is about the musical family that I\u2019ve put together,\u201d Smith continues. \u201cAll core members of the band have very unique and specific points of view.\u201d He reinforces the idea of family by composing tunes that touch upon his childhood. Such is the case with the jovial \u201cMorning and Allison,\u201d whose title partly invokes Allison Drive, the street on which Smith grew up. The song stars Ms. Whatt serenading idyllic recollections of a child enjoying a bright, fun-filled Sunday morning.\n\nSmith recorded his parents \u2013 Lettie and Theodore Smith \u2013 talking about their respective parents on the mesmerizing interludes \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad.\u201d On the former, Smith\u2019s mother tells how her father migrated from Virginia to Detroit and was drafted into U.S. Army then later returned to Virginia, where he bought the family a house. The latter provides a vehicle for his father to recall how his father tirelessly worked at Navy shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia during the Jim Crow era without getting proper financial compensation or promotion until decades later. \u201cI think of these stories as snapshots that ultimately gave shape to the Black American experience into which I was born, which ultimately informs this music\u201d Smith explains, before stressing the importance of having his parents\u2019 voices on the album.\n\nThe significance of having Smith\u2019s father on the disc was brought home even more after his passing in March 2015. \u201cHe never got a chance to hear the music or the band,\u201d Smith says.\n\nSmith celebrates the legacy of his paternal grandfather on the haunting ballad \u201cHome Free (Peter Joe).\u201d The song begins with a chamber- like string intro then moves into a gorgeous hymnal melody, highlighted by Shaw\u2019s uncoiling of a splendid, blues-soaked lyricism. \u201cOf my four grandparents, Peter Joe was the one I felt the closest to,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHe was a real buddy of mine. He died when I was only nine but I still think about him a lot.\u201d\n\nSmith reemphasizes the theme of nostalgia with \u201cRetold\u201d and \u201cPages.\u201d \u201cRetold\u201d finds Bowers tickling a melancholy yet romantic melodic motif on which guitar and saxophone run parallel lines across. \u201cWhen I started writing this song, it always sounded like someone telling a love story from start to finish,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe real feature of the song is Kris\u2019 amazing piano solo. He\u2019s so lyrical and rhythmic in the way that he plays.\u201d The dreamy \u201c\u201cPages\u201d becomes a superb showcase for Parlato to sing the song\u2019s theme about turning the pages of a photo album. \u201cI\u2019ve loved Gretchen since the first time I heard her sing,\u201d Smith says. \u201cShe becomes a part of the musical fabric. When she sings, it\u2019s never about the singer being at the front and the band being way in the back. It\u2019s all one sound. She also has really big ears and has amazing ideas about phrasing.\u201d\n\nThe spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement permeates the somber ballad \u201cDisenchantment: The Weight,\u201d another tune that spotlights Whatt\u2019s thoughtful lyrics and delicate singing. Underneath the prowling melody, Smith drums martial rhythms that convey a sense of marching forward. Written in the summer of 2013 soon after the verdict of the Trayvon Martin murder trial, Smith says that the song\u2019s cyclical harmonic pattern represents a longing sigh that many people felt and continue to feel after witnessing such ongoing travesties.\n\nFollowing that aforementioned song is \u201cSpinning Down,\u201d an intricate tune, marked by multiple subdivided rhythms inside of larger rhythmic cycles. Featuring Holland playing acoustic bass alongside Ephron on electric, intertwining saxophone passages from Shaw; incredible solos from Bowers and Loueke, and surprisingly the only drum solo on the disc, the song touches upon the theme of trying to ease a restless mind. \u201cIt works well right after \u2018Disenchantment\u2019 because that song is about everything that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cSpinning Down\u2019 is about the mind trying to work all that wrong out.\u201d\n\nThe other tunes on KINFOLK reflect Smith\u2019s unfettered love for groove and funk. The disc opens with the feisty \u201cSkip Step,\u201d a tricky tune, featuring Holland and Loueke, which Smith explains was influenced by his love for Earth, Wind & Fire; specifically the level of musical sophistication that the group\u2019s founder and leader, Maurice White ceaselessly incorporated in its signature sound. Smith describes the song as a straight-up R&B jam with an extra eighth note at the end \u2013 hence the song\u2019s title. \u201cI wanted the song to be as danceable as possible but with this one little hiccup or skip at the end of the phrase,\u201d Smith says. \u201cI also thought about Lionel, because, like Dave, he can make anything groove. He\u2019s such a relaxed player and his time-feel is so crazy that he can make any song feel good.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel good\u201d vibes carry over into \u201cBounce (Part I and II),\u201d featuring Potter on tenor saxophone. In fact, the song was first performed during Smith\u2019s tenure as a core member of Potter\u2019s acclaimed Underground ensemble. Smith revised the song to include another section after being influenced by Miles Davis\u2019 seminal 1986 LP, Tutu. \u201cOn Tutu, there\u2019s a little bit of written material and then there\u2019s a little bit of groove section in which people start improvising,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThen they go back to the written material. They cycle that around. That was the idea for \u2018Bounce.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust as the second part of \u201cBounce\u201d offered a canvas for Potter to improvise, the\nquicksilver \u201cFrom Here \u2013 Interlude\u201d does the same for Shaw, whom Smith praises as someone whose improvisations balance the wisdom of an older musician with the fiery enthusiasm of young gun.\n\nAs the title suggests, the fractured, hip-hop leaning \u201cSmall Moves \u2013 Interlude,\u201d is a play on Smith\u2019s manipulation of the song\u2019s chord changes by moving them from minor to major by the addition or subtraction of one note. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s an allegory for life \u2013 you can make one small move or say one small thing out of kindness or cruelty and it\u2019ll change your entire trajectory,\u201d Smith says.\n\n\u201cSpiracles\u201d \u2013 the sole non-original on the disc \u2013 is a Stereolab song from the group\u2019s 1999 disc, Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. On Smith\u2019s makeover, he decelerates the tempo then buttresses it with a more defining backbeat while retaining the song\u2019s billowing melody. The song includes a tender alto saxophone aside from Shaw, along with a lulling guitar solo from Rogers. \u201cI love the chord changes and the melody of that song. There\u2019s a cycle of discovery every time I go through that song\u2019s form,\u201d Smith enthuses.\n\nBecause Smith didn\u2019t come strictly from the formal matriculation of music studies as so many of his jazz contemporaries did, he lovingly describes his approach to drumming as \u201cunrefined,\u201d which in turns helps him distinguish his voice. He did, however, earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997 in media arts and design from James Madison University. While he was still in college, the legendary singer Betty Carter recruited him for her world-acclaimed Jazz Ahead program.\n\nSmith says that the visual arts discipline he studied in college definitely seeps into his compositions. \u201cI love great movies and images. I\u2019ve always had a deep interest in composing for film,\u201d Smith says. \u201cFor this project, there is something very cinematic about the way that I conceived this record. That\u2019s why it was so important for me to cast the right characters in terms of musicians. They bring to life the themes of family, nostalgia and identity that define this music.\u201d Ultimately, Smith likens the songs on KINFOLK to film vignettes sequenced together to tell a greater story about the unfolding journey of a working artist.

Perez, the band\u2019s drummer, once called their powerhouse mix of rock, Tex-Mex, country, folk, R&B, blues and traditional Spanish and Mexican music \u201cthe soundtrack of the barrio.\u201d Three decades, two more Grammys, a worldwide smash single (\u201cLa Bamba\u201d) and thousands of rollicking performances across the globe later, Los Lobos is surviving quite well -- and still jamming with the same raw intensity as they had when they began in that garage in 1973. The band chronicles a key moment of their expansive journey on Disconnected In New York City, a dynamic live album that marks the band\u2019s 40th anniversary and launches their new association with 429 Records.\n\n\n\nRecorded over two nights in December 2012 at The City Winery in NYC, the engaging 12-song set celebrates Los Lobos\u2019 great legacy as a freewheeling and unpredictable live band, which most recently includes touring in Europe with Neil Young and Crazy Horse in June 2013. Disconnected in New York City features fresh interpretations of songs from throughout their three decade recording career, including their first ever live recording of \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d their worldwide pop crossover hit from the 1987 film which reached #1 on the U.S. and UK singles chart and whose video won a 1988 MTV Music Video Award. The collection covers the band\u2019s 25 year studio discography, from \u201cGotta Let You Know\u201d (a bouncy zydeco rocker driven by Hidalgo\u2019s accordion from How Will The Wolf Survive?) through \u201cTin Can Trust,\u201d a bluesy rock ballad that was the title cut from their last studio release in 2010.\n\n\n\nBy design, Disconnected in New York City has songs that have been longtime staples of Los Lobos\u2019 tours mixed with other gems that had somehow fallen by the wayside over the years. The mix includes the mid-tempo shuffling rocker title track from The Neighborhood (1990); the easy flowing and whimsical (thanks to Berlin\u2019s jazzy sax solo) \u201cOh Yeah\u201d (from This Time, 1999); the spirited, traditional flavored, Rosas penned Spanish language \u201cChuco\u2019s Cumbia\u201d (from The Town and the City, 2006); the graceful and spiritual \u201cTears of God\u201d (from By The Light of the Moon, 1987); \u201cLa Venganza de Los Pelados,\u201d a fiery burst of Latin rock fusion with mariachi textures (from The Ride, 2004); the soulful, simmering blues of \u201cLittle Things\u201d (from The Town and The City, 2006); the Latin blues funk classic \u201cSet Me Free Rosa Lee\u201d (from By The Light of the Moon); and two mid tempo funk pop/rock tunes from 2002\u2019s Good Morning Aztlan, \u201cMaria Christina\u201d and \u201cMalaque.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs per the literal meaning of its title, Disconnected In New York City sets itself apart from Los Lobos\u2019 other acclaimed live recordings (most notably, 2005\u2019s Live At the Fillmore) by stripping down the instrumentation for a mostly acoustic affair. Lozano, who drives the grooves with his bass and also plays the deep-bodied Mexican 6-string acoustic bass called the guitarron, says, \u201cIt\u2019s funny because when the venue hired us, they specifically requested that we do something acoustic to fit its smaller dinner house vibe. The idea popped into our heads to ask them if we could record it and they were cool with that.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well known for our electric, high energy performances but we\u2019ve done acoustic stuff for certain smaller auditorium tours,\u201d he says. \u201cPlaying these songs acoustically makes them feel more intimate. We notice that when you play softer and quieter, the audience tends to pay attention to everything we\u2019re doing. When you play rock, they\u2019re thinking more about rhythm than melodies and lyrics, but playing them this way allows for more subtle elements of the songs to stand out.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerez laughs when he calls the Los Lobos Unplugged experience \u201cfolk music for the hearing impaired - it\u2019s still loud because the acoustic instruments are amplified! The idea of making a record like this came from never having the opportunity to work some of our favorite songs from over the years into our usual sets. Because most tours are done in support of new albums, the fresh material we play means that some favorite older tunes fall away over time. When we thought about making another live album and what would make it different, the logical concept was to revisit songs we haven\u2019t played in a while but had been requested by a lot of fans. We had already documented our rock show with Fillmore, so we felt kind of liberated to take another approach with this one.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are two challenges releasing a live album, though,\u201d Perez continues. \u201cOne is choosing certain songs over other ones. It\u2019s like having kids. We love Tommy as much as Johnny but one day Johnny gets to go the park today and Johnny stays home. In spite of this, we do cover a lot of ground. The biggest problem is the way people sometimes perceive live albums, like they\u2019re an afterthought put out to fill some kind of gap. Bands love doing them but fans don\u2019t always pay attention. But historically, it can be a license for great creativity. Jimi Hendrix did Band of Gypsies to fulfill his last recording commitment, but it was one of the most incredible recordings he ever made. Because Disconnected in New York City marks a key anniversary and the start of us working with a new label, we put a lot of thought into the project, from its design and structure and how we performed the songs.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteve Berlin is Los Lobos\u2019 saxophonist, flutist and harmonica player who met the band while still with seminal L.A. rockers The Blasters. He joined the group after performing on and co-producing (with T-Bone Burnett) their breakthrough 1983 EP \u2026And A Time To Dance. Though he wasn\u2019t jamming with the others way back in the \u201cKrypton days\u201d (as Perez calls it) in the barrio garage, Berlin felt it was important to find a special way to mark his cohorts\u2019 40th year--just as they had done on their 30th by inviting special guests (Dave Alvin, Bobby Womack, Elvis Costello, Mavis Staples) to be part of their 2004 date The Ride.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrying to figure out a way to acknowledge 40 years as a band is harder than you might think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got to play with all of our heroes on our 30th so what was something we had not done? So, like Louie said, we thought the best thing was to bring back songs we rarely if ever play and put them into a fresh context. We wanted to create something of value for our fans that would reflect the mutual appreciation we share with them \u2013 starting, of course, with \u2018La Bamba,\u2019 which we had never documented live before. I think it was important also that once we knew the set lists for the shows that we would eventually choose the final tracking from, we didn\u2019t over-think the arrangements. We only rehearsed these shows for a single day. The coolest part of how Disconnected worked out is that we hadn\u2019t been doing some of these songs long enough to worry about how to pull them off. And because we performed them acoustically, we couldn\u2019t just blast everyone with power and skate through them. We had to be present and make the choices that occurred to us in each moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nAround the time of their last big anniversary Rolling Stone magazine summed up that distinctive, diverse and spontaneous Los Lobos aesthetic perfectly: \u201cThis is what happens when five guys create a magical sound, then stick together for 30 years to see how far it can take them.\u201d Most fans know that the group came together from three separate units. Hidalgo, the band\u2019s lead vocalist/guitarist (whose arsenal includes accordion, percussion, bass, keyboards, melodic, drums, violin and banjo) met Perez at Garfield High in East LA and started a garage band. Rosas, who plays guitar and mandolin, had his own group, and Lozano launched a power trio. \u201cBut we all hung out because we were friends and making music was just the natural progression of things,\u201d says Perez. \u201cLike if you hang around a barbershop long enough, you\u2019re going to get a haircut.\u201d\n\n\n\nLooking back at the historical and cultural sweep of the band, Lozano sees the release of Disconnected In New York City as Los Lobos coming full circle. \u201cA lot of people forget that though we were rock musicians when we got out of high school, the band started off as an acoustic outfit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to play Mexican folk music because those were our roots and there was this whole Chicano awareness thing happening back in the early 70s. We started to pay attention to our traditions and culture, and focused on those styles of music for years. We studied music from every region of Mexico, learned how to play all these authentic instruments. So that\u2019s what we did for ten years until we decided to play rock again by bringing in drum and electric bass.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were playing this restaurant gig for two years, and some small local clubs, playing the same songs, when people in the crowd started shouting out, \u2018Do you know any Beatles or Grateful Dead tunes?\u2019\u201d Lozano adds. \u201cSoon we got fired from the restaurant and headed back to the garage to write our first original songs that were rock with some accordion on them: \u2018Let\u2019s Say Goodnight\u2019 and \u2018How Much Can I Do?\u2019 We made a little tape and gave it to the guys in The Blasters, which included Steve Berlin, when we went to see them live on Sunset Strip. They loved our tunes and invited us to open their show at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go, which was the first time Los Lobos performed on the other side of the Los Angeles River. We played some originals and old favorites by Hendrix, Cream, The Yardbirds and Beatles \u2013 all the stuff we loved as kids. The icing on the cake is that the audience loved it, too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "David Hidalgo only"}, {"Address": "41 Wharf Rd, Bolinas, CA 94924", "Artist": "Diego's Umbrella", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8450660.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.685106, 37.910178], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: Latin, Indie, Gypsy Rock, Ska, Alternative, Reggae", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Smiley's Schooner Saloon & Hotel", "moreBioInfo": "There are two kinds of people in this world: those who love Diego\u2019s Umbrella and those who don\u2019t know them yet.

Her work is reflective of transitions, the wilderness, and its navigation. Sometimes she plays banjo, other times acoustic guitar. Often, she plays a Telecaster fronting her band, The Home Team, featuring pedal steel (Tim Marcus), drums (Nick Cobbett), bass (Oscar Westesson), and various other Bay Area musicians.\nDuring her ten years in San Francisco, McFarling has released five independent recordings: studio albums, Distractible Child (2010) and Ridgeline (2013), an EP of cover songs, Others (2013), and two live albums, Live at Pirate Ship Laguna (2009) and Live at Eddie\u2019s Attic (2011). She has toured behind her own projects as well as performing with bands like Y La Bamba and Goodnight Texas, and is one-third of the all-female folk trio Glittersnatch with Megan Keely and Wolf Larsen. Over the years, McFarling has shared the stage with artists such as Shovels and Rope, Sean Hayes, Chris Pureka, Jolie Holland, and has made a home for herself in the San Francisco music community.\nWater Dog, McFarling\u2019s latest release, is her most intimate and folk-leaning record to date. She recorded the album in seasonal segments of 2016. The songs were first demoed with Allen Rothschild in his bedroom in Asheville, NC, where the creaks of his wood floor and the sounds of summer winding down made their way onto the recordings through open windows and live takes.The demos became the foundation of the record, and McFarling took them back to San Francisco, where Avi Vinocur of Goodnight Texas produced and engineered the majority of the record at his home in the Sunset District. \u201cRecording at Avi\u2019s house gave us the time to let the songs breathe and evolve.\u201d McFarling said of the process. \u201cIt gave us space to make decisions at our own pace. I\u2019ve never made a record like that, and it was a really special time. These songs were written in quiet spaces that were lived in. It made sense to record them in that way.\u201d\nThe album is a reflection on inward motion; on the way that water and its movement dominates our lives and bodies. It\u2019s about love, trust, and how we come to know the things we know. Above all, it\u2019s about the cycles of nature that have the power to be both grounding and destructive. \u201cWhile I was writing these songs, I was thinking a lot about family, stability, and love; and I was simultaneously starting to spend more time in and around the ocean. I was getting in the water a lot, and it opened a conversation about the nature of flow; learning to move with changes, instead of against them.\u201d\nIn addition to producing, Vinocur also plays on most of Water Dog and his work is prominent on signature tracks, like \u201cBoth.\u201d \u201cThat song was totally different when I brought it in. Avi simplified the groove, and made it more compelling.\u201d says McFarling. Vinocur also helped complete the writing of \u201cCaney Fork Overlook,\u201d one of the record\u2019s more classic country tunes. \u201cThat song had been half written for years. I wrote it in my van while on a road trip on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it was one of those songs that I never had expectations for. I wasn\u2019t sure it would be on the record. Avi helped get it to a place where it shines.\u201d In other more stripped down songs, McFarling often played live in one take. \u201cThe Storms are Getting Stronger,\u201d \u201cSpring Clean\u201d, and \u201cBox\u201d are songs that have been played in many different arrangements, mostly upbeat with a full band. For the recordings, I wanted them to go back to what they were when they were first written. Simple, quiet folk songs.\u201d\nAlthough Vinocur and McFarling play the bulk of the instrumentation on the record, they also tapped several trusted Bay Area musicians to explore additional layers of sonic texture. Water Dog features Tim Marcus on pedal steel and dobro, Graham Patzner on fiddle, Andrew Laubacher on percussion, Andrew Brennan on guitars, Oscar Westesson on upright bass, and John Elliott on piano. Austin-based band Whiskey Shivers also makes an appearance singing backup vocals on \u201cCaney Fork Overlook.\u201d\nWater Dog is a first for McFarling in many ways. It is the first record she has made without a band, the first time she approached recording without a deadline, and the first time she has explored stripped down instrumentation. \u201cFrom the beginning, the idea was always to let the songs speak for themselves and try not to get in the way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "863 Main St, Redwood City, CA 94063-1901", "Artist": "King", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.225831, 37.485447], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Angelicas", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1840 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "The Quilters", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9305543.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.452592, 37.769515], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Rock, Indie Pop, Folk, Bluegrass, Americana", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Milk Bar", "moreBioInfo": "@THEQUILTERSBAND", "otherInfo": "California's own Pr\u00f3xima Parada return to San Francisco on November 23rd!

Lockwood Porter's Communion in the Ashes is a rallying cry for the hopeless and heartbroken, its lyrics set to a soundtrack of anthemic heartland rock & roll. This is a record that addresses our modern-day social problems from a perspective of hope, encouraging those who listen to focus on activism and community-building rather than despair. Along the way, Porter delivers some of the most engaging, electrifying songs of his career, rooting these melodic calls-to-action in the stomp and epic swagger of a five-piece road band.\n\nBorn into a working-class family in rural Oklahoma, Porter launched his songwriting career after relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area, kicking things off with 2013's Judah's Gone. There, in the nation's most expensive real-estate market, he also taught classes to underprivileged students at an inner-city school, a job that gave him a close-up view of the nation\u2019s growing class divide and its many symptoms, including poverty, gentrification, and homelessness. As his cross-country touring increased, so did the presence of political and social issues within his music, with 2016's How to Dream Again taking influence from the socially-conscious works of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. After writing 2019's Communion in the Ashes, Porter returned to Oklahoma with the goal of contributing to a growing artistic community and, hopefully, affecting social change.\n\n\u201cThe tech boom of the last 10 years has totally transformed the whole Bay Area, and has essentially made it a playground for the rich. Working-class folks and artists aren't welcome there anymore, and this has manifested in rising housing costs, closure of music venues, and the proliferation of homeless tent cities,\u201d Porter divulges. \u201cIn the last verse of the title track, I can see in hindsight that I was saying a \u2018goodbye\u2019 to the Bay Area, even though I didn't know that I'd be leaving at the time.\u201d\n\nWith Communion In The Ashes, Porter crystallizes a sound that is uniquely his own: one that gatecrashes the borders between indie rock & roll, singer/songwriter folk, and Americana. Written alone on the acoustic guitar and recorded with Porter's band during a collaborative, five-day studio session in Chico, CA, the album champions togetherness as an antidote to the immense problems we face as a society. On the kinetic title track, a kick drum bangs out a steady pulse while Porter unveils his game plan: \"When the bridges are all burned, let's congregate the masses, let's hold a new communion in the ashes.\" The song doesn't turn a blind eye to the desperation of today's world; instead, it builds something new from the rubble, transforming desolation into hope. A similar feeling imbues the piano-propelled \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019,\" a secular hymn that nods to Porter's childhood days in the Southern Baptist church. If \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019\" evokes the solemnity of Sunday morning, though, the bulk of Communion in the Ashes rustles up the thrill of Saturday night. There are furiously strummed power chords, pounding percussion, vocal harmonies, and 80s-inspired synthesizers, shot through with a voice that's urgent, compelling, and quick to incite. These are songs about revolution and rebuilding, and Porter sings them accordingly, his voice echoing and rattling its way between the electric guitars and upright piano.\n\nGiven the album's communal emphasis, it's appropriate that Communion in the Ashes is also Porter's most collaborative release. All five band members contributed to the arrangement process, with drummer Peter Labberton pulling triple-duty as the album's engineer and mixer. The band worked swiftly, foregoing rehearsal in favor of instinctual performances and quick studio decisions. \"Get Back to the Wild,\" the one song not recorded live, gave the band a chance to experiment, building a two-bar drum and piano loop into a spiritually-minded song that examines the distance between human nature and human society. Porter and company looked to their own influences for cues, too, with Communion's touchstones running the gamut from Leonard Cohen\u2019s inventive songwriting and Tom Petty's concise melodies to Wilco's experimentation and War on Drugs' gorgeously textured tones. Even so, this is the most distinctive release in M. Lockwood Porter's catalog \u2014 an album that both nods to the past and pushes forward to the future, thanks in part to a full-band attack that lends fire, ferocity, and grit to the tracklist.\n\n\u201cI think the fully collaborative recording process was the biggest musical shift between recording How To Dream Again and Communion In The Ashes,\u201d explains Porter. \u201cJeremy Lyon has been playing in my live band since 2016, but this was the first M. Lockwood Porter album that he\u2019s worked on, and he brought a much wider palette of guitar tones to this album than I've used on past records. This is also the first time I\u2019ve recorded with synthesizers. I had given the band the vague direction that I wanted us to imagine ourselves as a \u2018dystopian gospel band\u2019 before we started recording, and my keyboardist Jeff Hashfield found a sound on his Prophet synthesizer that we ended up dubbing the \u2018Blade Runner church organ.\u2019 We ended up using it on nearly every song.\u201d\n\nThroughout Communion In The Ashes, Porter\u2019s electrifying \u201cdystopian gospel band\u201d explores how frightening our world can be. The record\u2019s enthralling cover art \u2014 designed by William Schaff, known for his longtime association with Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina \u2014 shines a light on that horrifying present, depicting a man (A preacher? An organizer? A demagogue?) addressing a crowd from the foreground of a burning, decaying city. With its Springsteen-sized catharsis, though, Communion in the Ashes offers listeners something new: a soundtrack with which to rise up, rebuild, and renew. Call it protest music if you'd like. Call it a political album if you must. Whatever the description, Communion in the Ashes packs the strongest punch of Porter's career, capturing not just one man's reaction to the present day, but an entire community's opportunity to better their own tomorrows.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Cautious Clay", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9061415.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: Alt, R&B, Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "emotional wealth", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "401 Van Ness Ave, Sf, CA 94102", "Artist": "LAGQ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8457203.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420688, 37.779613], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: Classical, Crossover, Classical Crossover, Guitar Virtuoso, Guitar Jazz, Brazilian Music, World, Chamber Music, Guitar Quartet, Spanish, Guitar Orchestra", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Herbst Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "The Grammy Award-winning LAGQ is multifaceted group, comprised of four uniquely accomplished musicians bringing a new energy to the concert stage with programs ranging from Bluegrass to Bach.

As a result, the album invites self-examination and a possible shift in the listener\u2019s way of getting around the world\u2014an effect that has everything to do with Jacklin\u2019s openness about her own experience.\n\n\u201cI used to be so worried about seeming demanding that I\u2019d put up with anything, which I think is common\u2014you want to be chill and cool, but it ends up taking so much of your emotional energy,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotten used to calling out things I\u2019m not okay with, instead of just burying my feelings to make it easier on everyone. I\u2019ve realized that in order to keep the peace, you have to speak up for yourself and say what you really want.\u201d\n\nProduced by Burke Reid (Courtney Barnett, The Drones) and recorded at The Grove Studios (a bushland hideaway built by INXS\u2019 Garry Gary Beers), Crushing sets Jacklin\u2019s understated defiance against a raw yet luminous sonic backdrop. \u201cIn all the songs, you can hear every sound from every instrument; you can hear my throat and hear me breathing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really important to me that you can hear everything for the whole record, without any studio tricks getting in the way.\u201d\n\nOn the album-opening lead single \u201cBody,\u201d Jacklin proves the power of that approach, turning out a mesmerizing vocal performance even as she slips into the slightest murmur. A starkly composed portrait of a breakup, the song bears an often-bracing intimacy, a sense that you\u2019re right in the room with Jacklin as she lays her heart out. And as \u201cBody\u201d wanders and drifts, Jacklin establishes Crushing as an album that exists entirely on its own time, a work that\u2019s willfully unhurried.\n\nFrom there, Crushing shifts into the slow-building urgency of \u201cHead Alone,\u201d a pointed and electrifying anthem of refusal (sample lyric: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched all the time/I raised my body up to be mine\u201d). \u201cAs a woman, in my case as a touring musician, the way you\u2019re touched is different from your male bandmates\u2014by strangers and by those close to you,\u201d notes Jacklin. On the full-tilt, harmony-spiked \u201cPressure to Party,\u201d she pushes toward another form of emotional freedom. \u201cWhen you come out of a relationship, there\u2019s so much pressure to act a certain way,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cFirst it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve gotta take some time for yourself\u2019\u2026but then if you take too much time it\u2019s, \u2018You\u2019ve gotta get back out there!\u2019 That song is just my three-minute scream, saying I\u2019m going to do what I need to do, when I need to do it.\u201d Crushing also shows Jacklin\u2019s autonomy on songs like \u201cConvention,\u201d an eye-rolling dismissal of unsolicited advice, presented in elegantly sardonic lyrics (\u201cI can tell you won\u2019t sleep well, if you don\u2019t teach me how to do it right\u201d).\n\nElsewhere on Crushing, Jacklin brings her exacting reflection to songs on loss. With its transportive harmonies and slow-burning guitar solo, \u201cDon\u2019t Know How to Keep Loving You\u201d ponders the heartache in fading affection (\u201cI want your mother to stay friends with mine/I want this feeling to pass in time\u201d). Meanwhile, on \u201cTurn Me Down\u201d\u2014an idiosyncratically arranged track embedded with hypnotic guitar tones\u2014Jacklin gives an exquisitely painful glimpse at unrequited devotion (\u201cHe took my hand, said I see a bright future/I\u2019m just not sure that you\u2019re in it\u201d). \u201cThat song destroyed me in the studio,\u201d says Jacklin of \u201cTurn Me Down,\u201d whose middle section contains a particularly devastating vocal performance. \u201cI remember lying on the floor in a total state between what felt like endless takes, and if you listen it kind of sounds like I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d And on \u201cWhen the Family Flies In,\u201d Jacklin shares her first ever piano-driven piece, a beautifully muted elegy for the same friend to whom she dedicated Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win. \u201cThere are really no words to do justice to what it feels like to lose a friend,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cIt felt a bit cheap to even try to write a song about it, but this one came out on tour and it finally felt okay to record.\n\nDespite its complexity, Crushing unfolds with an ease that echoes Jacklin\u2019s newfound self-reliance as an artist. Originally from the Blue Mountains, she grew up on her parents\u2019 Billy Bragg and Doris Day records and sang in musicals as a child, then started writing her own songs in her early 20s. \u201cWith the first album I was so nervous and didn\u2019t quite see myself as a musician yet, but after touring for two years, I\u2019ve come to feel like I deserve to be in that space,\u201d she says.\n\nThroughout Crushing, that sense of confidence manifests in one of the most essential elements of the album: the captivating strength of Jacklin\u2019s lyrics. Not only proof of her ingenuity and artistic generosity, Jacklin\u2019s uncompromising specificity and infinitely unpredictable turns of phrase ultimately spring from a certain self-possession in the songwriting process.\n\n\u201cAs I was making this album there was sort of a slow loosening of pressure on myself,\u201d Jacklin says. \u201cThere\u2019ve been some big life changes for me over the last few years, and I just found it too tiring to try to cover things up with a lot of metaphors and word trickery. I just wanted to lay it all out there and trust that, especially at such a tense moment in time, other people might want to hear a little vulnerability.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "900 Marin St, San Francisco, CA 94124", "Artist": "Duke Dumont", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8735823.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.386006, 37.749454], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Midway", "moreBioInfo": "Blas\u00e9 Boys Club.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1600 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Society Dog", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/159640.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399885, 37.765168], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Thee Parkside", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Christian Lee Hutson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9072828.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Sat Nov 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-23", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Indie", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "Over the past few years, Los Angeles-based musician Christian Lee Hutson has been trying to Figure It\nOut.

Todo se desplaza con un ritmo imponente que obliga a todos tus sentidos a escuchar y, en un segundo, explota en tu cerebro ocasionando que tus articulaciones reaccionen ante el \u00e9xtasis l\u00edrico de su comp\u00e1s. \u00bfLo visualizas? No importa el color que le des, ya est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed, de regreso, ya los conoces y vuelven con m\u00e1s energ\u00eda que nunca, es... \u201celefante\u201d.

Nombre inolvidable, quien no fue a un circo, o vio una pel\u00edcula sin que le llamara la atenci\u00f3n el Elefante, graciosos, noble, imponente, viril. Fuerte, furioso, sensible, obediente, m\u00e1gico, misterioso, m\u00edstico, un s\u00edmbolo. Casi extinto por su riqueza, venerado y respetado. Sobresale por sus dimensiones, por su andar sin reglas, obstinado y a la vez servil, \u00fatil y si se lo propone destructivo, fatal y letal. Porque un grupo de seres humanos, se obstinaron, se aferraron, en llamarse \u201celefante\u201d, \u00bfa quien se le puede olvidar un nombre tan obvio?, Tan rid\u00edculo, Tan imponente, Tan tierno y Tan lleno de fantas\u00eda Eso es \u201celefante\u201d, un nombre lleno de adjetivos, sentimientos y sensaciones. \u201celefante\u201d, es un nombre tan profundo y tan vago. Antag\u00f3nico de naturaleza, ambiguo y sin embargo tan claro y n\u00edtido. \u201celefante\u201d le canta al recuerdo y al olvido, al desamor y al absurdo, a la humanidad y a dios. \u201celefante\u201d esta rebosante de sensibilidad, de sencillez, de emociones, de amor, de dignidad, de igualdad y de humildad. \u201celefante\u201d crea su propio mundo a partir de historias sencillas, cotidianas, algunas propias, otras ajenas \u00f3 imaginarias. \u201celefante\u201d no es un grupo de una primera vez, su contacto es directo, in esquivable desde la primer escucha. Es un grupo que a medida que se le oye se descubre y redescubre, que no te deja de sorprender, en donde vuelves a descubrir un nuevo significado en la letra \u00f3 en alg\u00fan acorde. La formula esta en escucharlo y volver a escucharlo y volver a escucharlo y volver a ...... En palabras de ellos \u201celefante\u201d es: Canciones, historias, emociones, sentimientos transmitidos a trav\u00e9s de la m\u00fasica, sin mas pretensiones que sentir y hacer sentir a trav\u00e9s de una voz, una guitarra, una bater\u00eda, un bajo. M\u00fasica b\u00e1sica, sin complicaciones, directa, im\u00e1genes claras representadas en letras. Una mezcla de ritmos, influencias y emociones de cada uno de sus integrantes .

A modern-day Buckingham-Nicks, vocalist Tracey Holland and guitarist Chris Tye mix up a potent potion of sexy, sweaty 70s-era rock & roll. A package of Rolling Stones rock-meets-Alabama Shakes soul, the two met while both studying music in LA and spent the subsequent years traveling up and down the West Coast, honing their individual signatures and tying them together to form Vandella. Garnering comparisons to Stevie Nicks and Janis Joplin, Holland is a powerhouse of a frontwoman, whose vocal prowess is matched only by her insistent command of the stage. As writers, Holland is at times intense and bewitching; tempered by the understated, perennially-cool air of her counterpart in Tye. The result is a sound that feels both exciting yet effortlessly vibey - evocative of that hazy sheen of their native California.\n\nVandella\u2019s 2009 debut EP, V, saw the band move 2,000 copies independently, and in May 2012, with several West Coast tours completed, they released the full-length Fire in the Desert. For their 2014 follow-up, the band teamed up with SF producer Scott McDowell at his Hyde Street Studio C and released a 12-inch, 4-song EP titled Shine You Up. Shine You Up captured the basement-party, Exile On Main Street-esque style that the band has come to be known for in live shows, and established Vandella as a fixture on SF\u2019s indie-rock/soul scene. Vandella\u2019s newest EP, Strange Calls, was released on April 28th, 2016, with the first single, A Feeling I\u2019d Forgotten, premiered on the Huffington Post.

She spent the first five years of her life in the mid-western city of Lincoln, Nebraska, before the family moved to Northern California. The self-styled classic pop lover grew up listening to her parents\u2019 country and classic rock records, before she fell in love with strong female vocalists such as Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears. As a child, Eva had piano and voice lessons, and was in the choir in high school. It was then that she discovered that she suffered from terrible stage fright. Before long, though, she overcame her anxiety and appeared in high school musicals. But her father made her wait until after high school to pursue a music career, which she started at the age of 18, after spending a year at the University of Arizona. \u201cI started recording some of my own songs, and some covers - I was just messing around,\u201d she recalls. Her first composition was \u201ca heartfelt ballad\u201d about her first boyfriend called My Everything. \u201cListening back, I feel a bit, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s embarrassing,\u2019\u201d she winces. \u201cIt\u2019s cute, though.\u201d Nevertheless, people began to take note. Eva began working with the likes of: Jason \u201cPoo Bear\u201d Boyd, the brilliant, embattled Scott Storch, and Snoop Dogg. In 2011, Eva released her debut single, Not My Daddy, featuring rapper Gucci Mane. The single was successful in the clubs and reached No 8 on the Billboard Club Play chart. It proved something of a calling card, leading to invitations to perform as support to another legendary rapper, Nas, as well as Grammy-winning songsmith Alicia Keys. \u201cI remember one show, in front of 3,000 people, in Phoenix, Arizona - a lot of my friends from college came to see me, which was really exciting,\u201d she says. Her next single, Ashes, was a take on the children\u2019s nursery rhyme Ring A Round The Rosie, and was followed by Body On Mine, featuring rapper Tyga. It was a hit on SiriusXM radio. \u201cThey played it all the time,\u201d Eva enthuses. \u201cI\u2019d be driving around LA with my sisters in the car and it would come on. That was surreal.\u201d In late 2014, Eva issued Trapped, a song produced by J.R. Rotem (Rihanna, Britney) and written by Poo Bear, about imprisonment, as much by one\u2019s own fears and neuroses as by relationships. She performed at KIIS FM\u2019s Jingle Ball, the Hollywood House of Blues and Club Splash and was the Headliner at OC 2013 Gay Pride. In 2015, she embarked on Nick Cannon\u2019s 2015 Celebrity High Magazine Tour, where she performed five shows a month at select California high schools, following in the footsteps of her idol, Lady Gaga. Now, Eva has recorded a slew of new material: Bad For Us, Over U, and the guitar-driven Soul Survivor. \u201cThey\u2019re all break-up songs \u2013 I never intended them to sound like pop songs, but that's just how they turned out, I guess,\u201d Eva notes of what sound like pop anthems, with giant choruses and powerful hooks. To coincide with her new music, Eva has a strong new look, acquired with the help of Nigel Barker, a judge and photographer on America\u2019s Next Top Model. \u201cNigel really took me under his wing. He appreciates my sense of style,\u201d says Eva, \u201cI\u2019m definitely not the vanilla pop chick,\u201d she asserts. \u201cI have a little bit more of a dark edge,\u201d she adds of her style, which she describes as \u201csexy but relatable\u201d. \u201cI've always liked darker colors. I went through my punk rock phase. I wore a lot of black eyeliner and listened to Simple Plan and Good Charlotte. I love rock music - Queen, AC/DC...\u201d She pauses, then thinks back to her troubled adolescence. \u201cI was such an angsty teenager. I had a lot of interesting times growing up...\u201d Eva admits she was bullied in her teens, and struggled to fit in. She felt \u201cmad and angry at the world\u201d. Now, she uses her music to channel her feelings. \u201cEveryone\u2019s childhood shapes who they become,\u201d she reflects. \u201cIt still affects me in certain ways... But that\u2019s one of the reasons I love Lady Gaga - her message of inclusiveness and acceptance, and the idea that you should \u2018be yourself\u2019. I think that\u2019s why I have this amazing LGBTQ following: they tell me they love a strong, fierce woman.\u201d She believes she has two guises: the demure, serious singer-songwriter, and the larger-than-life identity that she assumes onstage. Eva can do \u201cfun dance pop music\u201d, but she\u2019s equally adept at \u201cdepressing ballads\u201d. A fan of La Roux on the one hand and Britney on the other, she also intends to negotiate that tightrope walk between indie electronica and mainstream pop. \u201cI want to find a balance,\u201d she says, keen to incorporate elements of hip hop, R&B, funk and rock. \u201cI have some meaningful songs and just some plain feel-good music. I want to be able to do it all - to be crazy and upbeat onstage but also sing something slow and emotional or cutting-edge. Why not?\u201d Why not indeed. \u201cI want to spread joy in this world,\u201d decides the California girl intimate with the art of darkness, finally. \u201cEverybody needs that moment where you take a break from all the crap and have some fun. That\u2019s where my music comes in: I want to spread the love. But I don't want to be portrayed as just another blonde party girl. That's not me. Beneath the surface, I\u2019m very real.\u201d Eva Singer*Dancer*Performer*Entertainer Taking over the Universe with the power of music, struggle, healing, and love!

Lastly, ICON\u2019s production endeavors have proven to be as exciting as her DJ career. Her releases on Illeven Eleven Records: \u201cWelcome To My Dancefloor\u201d with Dustin Hulton featuring Nikki Carabello and \u201cWha?\u201d a collaboration with Bay Area producer Ground_Control had steller reviews and support by leading artists in the industry. \u201cDancefloor\u201d charted at #8 and #22 on the Beatport Breakbeat and Electro charts with a great review in Mixmag.

Described by DJ Mag as \u201cone of the most talented new forces in modern dance music today\u201d and by fellow future house innovators Art Department as their favourite producer, Lee has firmly established himself in dance music\u2019s collective consciousness. Lee and his Hot Natured band mates Jamie Jones and Infinity Ink are currently leading a whole family of like-minded producers that includes Richy Ahmed, WaFF, Digitaria, Robert James and Miguel Campbell, who are currently re-writing the rulebook of how to make evocative, emotive house music. In 2010 he was the highest new entry into Resident Advisor\u2019s key Top 100 DJs poll, entering at number 38 and by 2011 he had climbed to number 18 in the chart, a huge feat given that he only played his first European gig in 2009. Having hit the UK charts with \u2018Benediction\u2019 as part of deep house super group Hot Natured, with genre-spanning hits such as \u2018Electricity\u2019 (with MK) and \u2018Reverse Skydiving\u2019 under his belt, alongside remixes of chart topping artists such as Rudimental and Lana del Ray, Lee Foss is one of the most exciting forces in modern house music. Not forgetting Hot Creations, the groundbreaking label he runs with partner Jamie Jones, which is arguably one of the world\u2019s most innovative house labels. His unique sound, born out a lifelong love of classic house, 90s hip hop, 80s electro and Detroit techno, has earned him fanatical grassroots support from clubbers in both Europe and North America. Born and raised in Chicago, the birthplace of house, Lee now lives between London and Los Angeles. Lee made his name on both sides of the Atlantic playing at clubs like Fabric (London), Warung (Brazil), The Warehouse Project (Manchester), The Standard Rooftop (Lost Angeles), The Marcy Hotel (Brooklyn), Watergate (Berlin) and Spybar (Chicago). Lee\u2019s rapid rise to prominence has been as much down to his focused but all-encompassing approach to DJing as it has his pioneering take on nu-school house and synth-heavy techno, backed up by a string of hit releases on labels like No 19, Culprit, Wolf+Lamb and his own Hot Creations imprint. While growing up in Chicago, Lee cut his teeth on the clubs and raves of the late 90\u2019s, experiences that initially sparked his interest in house and disco. However, it was a chance visit to Ibiza back in 2001, that changed his whole approach to music and helped steer his musical destiny for the next decade and beyond. It was in Ibiza that summer that he first became friends with Jamie Jones and the pair formed a tight brotherly bond that quickly blossomed into their highly acclaimed Hot Creations label partnership with Richy Ahmed, and later their Hot Natured band project with Infinity Ink and their worldwide event brand, Paradise. Since then, Lee has gone on to release a string of hits on a variety of labels including \u2018The Edge EP\u2019, \u2018Equilibrium\u2019, \u2018U Got Me\u2019 and \u2018Starfruit EP\u2019, all of which have been independently awarded \u2018Tune of the Month\u2019 in Mixmag at various points. Lee has recently joined forces with house legend MK and vocalist Anabel Englund to form a second electronic outfit, Pleasure State. The trio\u2019s first EP, Electricity, has already landed to much success with Pete Tong announcing the title track as his \u2018Essential New Tune\u2019 earlier this year. With this many accolades under his belt in such a short space of time, it would be easy for Lee to rest on his laurels but this couldn\u2019t be farther from the case. Hot Natured\u2019s latest single release \u2018Reverse Skydiving\u2019, is shaping up to be one of the summer\u2019s biggest hits. The debut Hot Natured album is due to follow in the summer, and backed by Pete Tongs legendary FFRR imprint is already garnering incredible anticipation ahead of its release. The innovative Hot Natured Live Show kicked off with two back to back sold out shows at Brixton Academy earlier this Spring and will lead into the band headlining slots at the new Silver Hayes dance stage at Glastonbury, Sonar in Barcelona, Bestival on the Isle of Wight and Wavefront in Chicago.

Both of these disparate strands filtered through a lifetime on the run and on the search for a universal truth from psychedelic Brazilian forests to US college campuses and further into his own unique vision. JL Stiles has a mind that sees music in a similar way to how J.S. Bach saw music, however, Bach never played the blues.\n\nFact # 1: JL Stiles is the John Nash of music.\n\nJL Stiles was born with hardwiring most only dream about, a brain that could look at the most basic picture and convert it to it's numerical basics. All through school in rural Connecticut it was clear where he was going to be, working at the cutting edge of mathematics, as he took to the abstract shapes and numbers as a duck would take to proverbial water, until, that is, a band wearing grease paint, Cuban heels, questionable body hair and several pints of fake blood rolled into JL's particular little town: Kiss. A 12 year old JL was hooked by the devils fishing rod that was rock and/or roll and when his brother brought home a terrible guitar from college and left it when he went back, JL had the tools to begin his assault on the world.\n\nHe began fashioning songs using the simple chunking and melody of Jimmy Reed and sub-Rush lyrics about the challenging political world as seen by a 13-year old kid. Quick introductions to the lyrics of Bob Dylan, the power and message of The Who and the space-age ass funk of Parliament, shaped his musical balloon in new ways and JL, taking his John Nash brain and applying it to the one piece of equipment he had at his disposal, a useless dime store guitar, realized pretty quickly that he better maximize the algorithmic potential of the pathetic instrument by learning to pick each and every string independently and simultaneously with the dexterity of a perfect machine and the re-incarnated soul of a genius blind bluesman who strangely disappeared in the early 1930's. That blind genius would be the little known 20's & 30's virtuoso, Blind Blake, who JL heard by accident, floating in from the radio of his father while studying late one night on a mathematical problem involving fourier transformations. He rushed to the transistor just quickly enough to catch the name and his future was born. (He also finished the problem that night in case you wondered).\n\nFact #2: JL Stiles is the freakiest white fingerpicking guitarist in this great country right now.\n\nStiles carried on in his twin disciplines, learning Banach spaces and homology at college by day and wearing out his Blind Blake records at night, studying under the tutelage of the great Laszlo Fuchs, pioneer of abelian group theory, whilst writing hundreds of songs, each one getting gradually better than the last. Both strands were equal to him as he searched for the big picture in whatever way he could.\n\nBut something began to happen; as the songs got better and began to get attention, especially from the ladies, and JL realized that, Fuchs aside, a lot of academicians can be big dicks with fragile egos, he began to drift toward the more standard methods of soul searching for a young guy in late 20th century America: LSD, pot and anything other.\n\nHanging out in the blazing heat studying with Chinese Mathematicians, drifting into oblivion on opium and psychedelics, JL knew the music was more than a sideshow to a brilliant career in the outer reaches of theoretical math. It was, in fact, his calling, and one where he could teach the beauty of what is so perfect about math and blues, the abstract.\n\nImagine a wild-eyed, half-crazed math prodigy with the most dexterous fingers on earth, channeling the spirit of a mysterious blind blues genius who unexplainably vanished, and you are approaching where JL found himself at this juncture in his life.\n\nFact #3: The search for the fundamentals is the same in music as it is in math: The fingerpicking guitar opens up infinite possibilities\n\nBut what would he do with this burden? He wasn't just a singer-songwriter with a cute heartbreak song and a big white smile; he was the walking soul of mathematical fundamental principles driven into the ground by the spirit of the blues. Where could a young boy like this go? To the home of voodoo, New Orleans.\n\nIn an out of the coffee houses and clubs of New Orleans and Mississippi, JL spooked the audiences up and down and left and right, he cut a solo set of songs, just him and a guitar, that rang as clear and true as Blind Blake had 80 years earlier and he knew he had to get out there and spread the theory around.\n\nHe traveled to Mexico and Brazil, Amsterdam and Scandinavia, he lived in the woods for weeks at a time, writing new songs and trying to define a unifying mathematical and musical theory in homological algebra, he went to the brink and stared at the abyss and then he came back with songs in hand to deliver the message back to us dear souls who hadn't made the journey.\n\nHe found a spiritual home in san Francisco and immediately picked up on the musical community there. He played with Etta James in front of 6,000 in front of the courthouse in Riverside, he opened for the great Keb Mo, Leon Redbone, JJ Cale, John Hammond, he knew he was in the right place at the right time, and so, here he is.\n\nFact #4: What JL Stiles is writing now is the best he's ever written and is closer to the fundamental truth of bringing the past together with the future into a musical singularity than he's ever gotten.\n\nFact #5: JL Stiles believes he has come up with the algorithm for the pure heart of music.\n\nJL Stiles is a unique animal (as we have stated before), he believes that the soul of 1920's blues, c.400 BC Greek mathematicians and 21st century artists like Animal Collective (get ready for JL's incendiary cover of AC's \"No More Runnin\") can all be unified into his singular vision. Can he do it?

But it was only when Tim later discovered the releases of Cologne techno luminary Robert Babicz that synthesizers and bass drums moved into focus - a brilliant producer, live performer and mastering engineer with a keen sense for sonic detail, Babicz became the perfect role model for young Tim, inspiring our hero to seek out his own place in electronic music while honing a concise understanding for all facets of production. Part of a diverse new breed of young producers that get their cues from all sorts of genres and listening situations, Tim still stands apart, having released his very first record when he was just 14 years old. Combining profound musical knowledge with intuitive playfulness, his solid pianist background becomes rather obvious in the great care he takes over harmonies and an expanded melodic structure. Pair that with the organic fluidity and atmospheric dexterity of his music and you've got yourself a winning recipe. Consequently, Tim grew his portfolio with plenty outings on labels such as Traum Schallplatten, WIR, Babiczstyle, Amuse Gueule, Ostwind Records, Popart Music, Playmusic Productions, Parquet Recordings, Manual Music and Steve Bug's iconic Poker Flat Recordings\u2013 an impressive amount of label royalty that he's amassed in only four short years. Stay tuned for more Tim Engelhardt on key imprints such as Dixon's Innervisions or Cityfox - exciting things are coming your way. Underscored by a torrent of remix and release offers, Tim's busy schedule is testament to his growing popularity among electronic music fans - preparations for tours to the US, Asia and India are underway, and also a first trip to Australia has already been checked off that bucket list. Meanwhile, inspiration for Tim's personal brand of melodic house and techno can come from many sources: childhood memories of Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells\" playing in his dad's car, a walk in nature - or simply mining his modular synth for happy accidents. Gear, however, is only a means to an end for Tim: rather than drooling over hardware, he celebrates art with a distinct personality - art that carries a piece of its creator inside. To find the most powerful expression for the sounds in his head, that's his mission... which is why Tim's music sounds nothing like your run-of-he-mill, straight-to-DJ floor chow, but subtly turns heads with a cohesive, fully-formed musical vision that shines in the club and at home.

His dance music roots lie in Disco of the 70\u2019s and New Wave of the 80\u2019s. Presently living in San Francisco, he was born and raised in Montreal, Canada, and got tuned into dance music through the city\u2019s flourishing club scene and diverse radio broadcasts. He started collecting vinyl records in the mid 70\u2019s and took to the turntables in 1985, scoring his first major club gig two years later. Hearing the non-stop flow of music and observing the booth where the DJ seamlessly blended each selection were early influences for Julius. Later influences included reading about DJ residencies that were piloted by talented club music programmers that even today, influence the youngest of aspiring DJ\u2019s - legends like David Mancuso at The Loft & Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York City to Frankie Knuckles at The Warehouse in Chicago and Tony Humphries\u2019 weekly at Zanzibar in New Jersey. Always inspired by the music listed in those articles, Julius would shop for those titles that would later become classics, worshipped by their discerning audiences. To this day, his goal is to keep expanding his foundation in music by being open-minded and eclectic in absorbing the music that truly touches him. That open-minded attitude is what Julius uses to fine-tune his musical palette, which gives him a dominant sound that exudes a deep and soulful perspective. That dominant sound is (Soulful) House Music \u2013 which to him, is about an uplifting positive message. People coming together in unity, with no barriers or restrictions, but rather, with tolerance and the spirit of music, unifying everyone on the dance-floor. That being said, he blends various musical styles together - including Soul, Latin, Afro, Disco, Jazz and Electronic sounds with such fluidity, that it is difficult at times to put a defining stamp on his sound. Contributing to that is his willingness to take a chance. He always tries to push the envelope by introducing music that deserves exposure, taking his audience on a musical journey with various mood and energy changes. Not content to limiting his ambitions in the DJ booth, Julius began producing music in 1994. The studio was another outlet for Julius\u2019 creative ideas to flow. His first release was a down-tempo project on the Acid Jazz tip. He also drew attention as part of the jazz and funk scene in San Francisco via the Mushroom Jazz parties alongside resident Mark Farina. As Julius\u2019 production catalogue grew, so did the amount of labels he released music on including \u2013 long tenured labels like King ST (NYC), Nervous Records (NYC), Large Music (Chicago) and OM (SF), to signings on Soulfuric Recordings (FL) and Kenny Dope\u2019s \u201cDope Wax\u201d (NYC) label, as well as Bob Sinclar\u2019s own Yellow Productions in Paris. He also ventured into the label arena with his own \u201cNeoDisco Music\u201d imprint. Named after the sound that continues to inspire him \u2013 the label offers him an alternate outlet to release his own productions. As a veteran in the club scene, Julius has refined a style of dance music that has taken him beyond the boundaries of San Francisco to global praise and recognition. Being nominated as \u201cMost Innovative Producer\u201d at the 2004 House Music Awards is a perfect example of that. Putting him in the company of other nominated producers like, Joey Negro, Osunlade, DJ Gregory, DJ Spinna and Ben Watt was an absolute honor for him. Upcoming releases for 2014 include a compilation/mix CD entitled \u201cA Long Hot Summer\u201d on King ST Recordings (NYC) as well as Julius\u2019 next full-length, artist-album, plus several singles. Recent production highlights include; Julius\u2019s collaboration with Lisa Shaw entitled \u201cWay Back,\u201d (DJ Smash Brooklyn Tech Remix), featured on the CBS crime drama, CSI: Miami; The song \u201cBelieve\u201d (with Deep Culture & Deborah Bond), included on Danny Krivit\u2019s 10 Year Anniversary, 718 Sessions, compilation/mix CD on Nervous Records. \u201cMusic Is The Key.\u201d Music Producer / DJ", "otherInfo": "Salted + Prismatic are delighted to present an intimate rooftop edition at Hotel Via, as we kick off the holidays and celebrate the birthday of Prismatic's Andrew Phelan!\n\nVia's rooftop will be outfitted with a full cover clear canopy and space heaters throughout.

Carlos Xavier is his name and singing is his game!\n\nCarlos engages his audience with his pure, passionate vocals. Backed by his band and his years of musical experience Carlos is able rise up and shine. His music has taken his groups all over the world. He has played with Los Mocosos at the East Coast Blues and Roots Festival in Australia as well as throughout the Caribbean as a cruise ship entertainer. Carlos has toured throughout the United States as well as Canada. When not on the road Carlos can be heard throughout nightclubs weekly.\n\nThe past years have served to educate and develop Carlos\u2019 talent as he currently heads his solo career. The result is outstanding musicianship and a fully developed, unique sound. His sound is very identifiable to the Latin American community as it draws from Latin Balada roots and meshes them with the rock and pop. His melodies are expressed through his passionate lyrics and his desire reach people\u2019s souls.

This salsa album ranges from R&B, Rock, Hip-Hop, Gospel, Blues, Vallenato to Latin Pop all within the rules of salsa. An album for all types of listeners to enjoy. I made an album to make you dance, laugh, sing, cry and simply to enjoy listening to. A must for DJ\u2019s and salsa music lovers.\n\nWhen I fell in love with salsa, about 22 years ago, it became my dream to make a salsa album. Especially using the musicians and producers that made the style of salsa that I loved. I never believed it would happen but it did. With this album I plan to bring that style of salsa back that I heard many years ago and make it relevant to today, all while making it my own.\n\nI grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a melting pot of cultures so I had many genres of music in my ear. My song writing style shows that and I\u2019m very proud of it. A first generation born American to parents born in Nicaragua, my Latin roots will always be who I am, and I feel fortunate to have grown up in an era where many styles of urban music were being brought to life.

It was always already implicit in his music, from \u201cMiner\u2019s Prayer\u201d on his first album 30 years ago to his one-off collaborations with Ralph Stanley and Earl Scruggs. If you listened hard, you could even hear that strain of mountain music in the melodies and harmonic sense of his most rocked-out country hits. He wasn\u2019t consciously thinking through the years that he could bust out the mandolins to confirm his Kentucky bona fides \u2013 \u201cMelodically, it\u2019s just part of my nature,\u201d Yoakam says, \u201cpart of the birthright, I guess, in my DNA.\u201d Yet here he is, releasing Swimmin\u2019 Pools, Movie Stars\u2026 in the same year that he is celebrating the 30th anniversary of Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.. Swimmin\u2019 Pools, Movie Stars\u2026 harks back to that landmark debut in its obviously cheeky title, while otherwise looking even farther back by recasting some of Yoakam\u2019s most classic songs in a style that not only predates cowpunk but antecedes his beloved Bakersfield sound. Yoakam even remakes \u201cGuitars, Cadillacs\u201d in the style of \u201cMan of Constant Sorrow.\u201d No one is ever going to mistake a star so renowned for favoring snug jeans with a Soggy Bottom Boy, but here, he clinches his status as at least an honorary Clinch Mountain lad. \"And then Chris Lord-Alge, who has mixed my last 2 studio albums, entered the picture in LA and agreed to add a further edge of Beggars Banquet-esque rock and roll mystique, completing the journey with a masterfully unique sonic framing of the entire project. I believe it was the first bluegrass album that Chris has ever mixed.\u201d \u201cIt was part of Alison Krauss\u2019 Union Station band colliding with the remnants of the Soggy Bottom band,\u201d says Yoakam, talking about the four days of band tracking he did in Nashville and April with a group of acoustic all-stars he\u2019d never worked with before. The ensemble included guitarist Bryan Sutton, fiddler Stuart Duncan, bassist Barry Bales, mandolin player Adam Steffey, and banjo player Scott Vestal, under the production oversight of Gary Paczosa (another Krauss veteran) and Jon Randall (the co-writer of country hits like \u201cWhiskey Lullaby\u201d). \u201cAnd then I threw, I guess, a hillbilly version of the Beach Boys at it with my harmony vocals. That core bunch of players there in Nashville for those four days was a really fortuitous vortex, with those guys responding to what I wanted to do and me saying, \u2018Look, let\u2019s leave it loose and ragged at times.\u2019 Rock and roll got some of its swagger from bluegrass. Let\u2019s go back there and show some of that swagger if we can.\u201d Swimmin\u2019 Pools, Movie Stars\u2026 started as, if not an assignment, at least a suggestion, and one he readily took to once he found the right recording window. \u201cKevin Welk had asked my managers a couple years ago if I would do a bluegrass album for his then-label Vanguard/Sugar Hill,\u201d Yoakam says. \u201cSubsequently they merged with Concord Music Group, which owned Rounder, and it became that entire music company, and they came back to us again this year. At the first ask, I had been in the middle of doing Second Hand Heart,\u201d his 2015 return to the Warner Bros. Records stable from which he sprang three decades ago. \u201cCameron Strang, who runs Warners, graciously allowed me to take this year off in terms of delivering my next studio album for them (Warner) to do this project, because he knew it was a passion project for me.\u201d The original idea was to make it a covers album, before it ended up being an album of Dwight Yoakam covers, with one notable exception \u2013 a cover of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d \u201cBut when Gary and JR (Randall) came to do a meeting with me, they said, \u2018You know, we started listening to your catalog, and we found songs where we thought, \u201cWow, that was never a single. Nobody ever heard that. Should we do that with him?\u201d\u2019 I let them come to me with titles that they liked. I didn\u2019t really pick; they did. And we ended up with 11 tracks that had been on my earlier albums, but only two of them, \u2018Guitars, Cadillacs\u2019 and \u2018Please, Please Baby,\u2019 were ever hits. Only one other song had even been a single, \u2018These Arms,\u2019 and it didn\u2019t crack the top 30. So I don\u2019t know if \u2018obscure\u2019 is the word for these songs \u2014people that had my albums have come across them \u2014 but they\u2019re the tracks that were songs less traveled.\u201d The bluegrass influence \u201chas always kind of been, as Glenn Frey would say, whispering in my other ear,\u201d Yoakam says. Some of the signposts: In 1997, Yoakam recorded a cover of the Clash\u2019s \u201cTrain in Vain\u201d with Dr. Ralph Stanley on banjo and harmonies. On the Earl Scruggs and Friends album in 2001, Yoakam co-wrote and sang \u201cBorrowed Love\u201d with another one of the genre\u2019s great banjo players. In the mid-2000s, Yoakam started introducing a bluegrass-style acoustic rave-up mini-set in the middle of his otherwise electrified shows. And it\u2019s been a mutual love affair. The influence he had on bluegrass himself was palpable, most obviously with the release of a Pickin\u2019 on Dwight Yoakam bluegrass tribute album. Just this July, the group Flatt Lonesome was nominated for an International Bluegrass Music Award for Best Song for their cover of Yoakam\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the One.\u201d But the seed for Yoakam going a little bit more bluegrass himself, outside the realms of duets and tributes? \u201cIn deference to his recent passing, I need to mention that the first person who ever mentioned it to me was Ralph Stanley,\u201d Yoakam says. \u201cIn the early \u201890s, I went in and recorded with Ralph around two Neumann microphones with the live bluegrass band that was the Clinch Mountain Boys at that time. He invited me to be his guest on his double album Saturday Night, Sunday Morning. And he looked at me after we finished doing \u2018Miner\u2019s Prayer\u2019 and said, \u2018Me and the band think you ought to think about being a bluegrass singer.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, I guess my birth certificate gives me some credentials to own the holler that I was living in the first couple years of my life, and musically express that.\u2019 Being born into rural southeast Kentucky there in Pike County, which is just across the Virginia state line from the area of the Clinch Mountains where the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family came out of, maybe it was inevitable. But, having said that, let\u2019s wait a minute and \u2014 wee doggies! \u2013 see what we did to it.\u201d Wee doggies, indeed. The principal tracks for Swimmin\u2019 Pools, Movie Stars\u2026 were recorded at Zac Brown\u2019s studio in Nashville, Southern Ground (formerly Fred Foster\u2019s Monument Records home, memorialized in Dave Grohl\u2019s recent documentary visit to the nation\u2019s great recording studios). Later, Yoakam cut vocals at Hollywood\u2019s Capitol Studios, where he\u2019s done most of his albums, as well as the former A&M Records lot (now Henson Studios) and East West (formerly United Western, where Pet Sounds was cut). These are all \u201cvery historic\u201d places, but \u201cit wasn\u2019t just for shits and grins. It was for the purpose of gathering the magic out of those rooms.\u201d In one sense, Yoakam wanted to be as faithful to the original traditions as possible, and in another, to mess with those just a little. \u201cI was very strident about exacting a colloquial expression from the guys when they sang along with me,\u201d he says \u2014 and the music reaches its \u201chardcore\u201d peak when Jonathan Clarke sings a bass background vocal on \u201cHome for Sale.\u201d But a song like \u201cListen\u201d \u201clent itself to a moment of departure,\u201d where Yoakam was able to \u201creinterpret west coast sounds\u201d in the vocal stacking. \u201cIt\u2019s really a composite of disparate elements that coalesce in this,\u201d he says. \u201cCountry-rock was born when Chris Hillman, who was a bluegrass mandolin player, took Clarence White, who came out of hardcore bluegrass, into the Byrds\u2019 circle on the album before Sweethearts of the Rodeo. So there\u2019s this west coast bluegrass contingent that still echoes in my head \u2014 that whole sort of Byrds/Beach Boys thing colliding with mountain culture.\u201d That\u2019s where the title comes in. \u201cIt\u2019s tongue in cheek,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause the album started in Nashville, and ended up in\u2026 well, you know, California is the place you oughta be!\u201d He might sound Beverly Hillbillies flippant in saying that, but underneath the jibing, there\u2019s a real sense of history in how Yoakam sees California\u2019s role even in bluegrass. \u201cI thought, well, I\u2019m gonna give a wink back to everybody, to Flatt and Scruggs and Jimmy Martin and everybody who came out here. And this album really is that hybrid expression of a journey \u2014 and it\u2019s the American journey. It\u2019s the Dust Bowl \u201830s era blowing colloquial music out to California with all the Okie/Arkie/Texan migrants. Folks from Kansas and Nebraska and the plains all ended up out here and brought with \u2018em their cultural elements. Without that, you don\u2019t have Buck Owens out here, and you don\u2019t have Merle Haggard, perhaps, in the way that we knew him.\u201d And without them, you certainly don\u2019t have the man many of us consider the reigning king of California country, Dwight Yoakam. So where does \u201cPurple Rain\u201d fit into that, anyway? It\u2019s the odd song out, certainly, though Yoakam and Prince share something in common as far as having been mentored to some extent by Lenny Waronker at Warner Bros. \u201cWe had finished two days of recording the tracks, and I woke up at the hotel in Nashville and heard the news. I was thinking about him and thinking about how uniquely he impacted the culture, so when I got to the studio and everybody was talking about the shock of it, I said \u2018I feel like I want to sing \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d\u2019 because I\u2019ve always felt that was one of the more beautiful melodies. We cut it, and I didn\u2019t think about it again, because I thought the emotion of it just got everybody wanting to express something. I didn\u2019t think it was going to be on the record. But months later, I put it on and realized how those guys really played with their hearts that day.

Lockwood Porter", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8982336.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.121327, 37.124938], "Date": "Sun Nov 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-24", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "lille aeske arthouse", "moreBioInfo": "M. Lockwood Porter's Communion in the Ashes is a rallying cry for the hopeless and heartbroken, its lyrics set to a soundtrack of anthemic heartland rock & roll. This is a record that addresses our modern-day social problems from a perspective of hope, encouraging those who listen to focus on activism and community-building rather than despair. Along the way, Porter delivers some of the most engaging, electrifying songs of his career, rooting these melodic calls-to-action in the stomp and epic swagger of a five-piece road band.\n\nBorn into a working-class family in rural Oklahoma, Porter launched his songwriting career after relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area, kicking things off with 2013's Judah's Gone. There, in the nation's most expensive real-estate market, he also taught classes to underprivileged students at an inner-city school, a job that gave him a close-up view of the nation\u2019s growing class divide and its many symptoms, including poverty, gentrification, and homelessness. As his cross-country touring increased, so did the presence of political and social issues within his music, with 2016's How to Dream Again taking influence from the socially-conscious works of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. After writing 2019's Communion in the Ashes, Porter returned to Oklahoma with the goal of contributing to a growing artistic community and, hopefully, affecting social change.\n\n\u201cThe tech boom of the last 10 years has totally transformed the whole Bay Area, and has essentially made it a playground for the rich. Working-class folks and artists aren't welcome there anymore, and this has manifested in rising housing costs, closure of music venues, and the proliferation of homeless tent cities,\u201d Porter divulges. \u201cIn the last verse of the title track, I can see in hindsight that I was saying a \u2018goodbye\u2019 to the Bay Area, even though I didn't know that I'd be leaving at the time.\u201d\n\nWith Communion In The Ashes, Porter crystallizes a sound that is uniquely his own: one that gatecrashes the borders between indie rock & roll, singer/songwriter folk, and Americana. Written alone on the acoustic guitar and recorded with Porter's band during a collaborative, five-day studio session in Chico, CA, the album champions togetherness as an antidote to the immense problems we face as a society. On the kinetic title track, a kick drum bangs out a steady pulse while Porter unveils his game plan: \"When the bridges are all burned, let's congregate the masses, let's hold a new communion in the ashes.\" The song doesn't turn a blind eye to the desperation of today's world; instead, it builds something new from the rubble, transforming desolation into hope. A similar feeling imbues the piano-propelled \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019,\" a secular hymn that nods to Porter's childhood days in the Southern Baptist church. If \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019\" evokes the solemnity of Sunday morning, though, the bulk of Communion in the Ashes rustles up the thrill of Saturday night. There are furiously strummed power chords, pounding percussion, vocal harmonies, and 80s-inspired synthesizers, shot through with a voice that's urgent, compelling, and quick to incite. These are songs about revolution and rebuilding, and Porter sings them accordingly, his voice echoing and rattling its way between the electric guitars and upright piano.\n\nGiven the album's communal emphasis, it's appropriate that Communion in the Ashes is also Porter's most collaborative release. All five band members contributed to the arrangement process, with drummer Peter Labberton pulling triple-duty as the album's engineer and mixer. The band worked swiftly, foregoing rehearsal in favor of instinctual performances and quick studio decisions. \"Get Back to the Wild,\" the one song not recorded live, gave the band a chance to experiment, building a two-bar drum and piano loop into a spiritually-minded song that examines the distance between human nature and human society. Porter and company looked to their own influences for cues, too, with Communion's touchstones running the gamut from Leonard Cohen\u2019s inventive songwriting and Tom Petty's concise melodies to Wilco's experimentation and War on Drugs' gorgeously textured tones. Even so, this is the most distinctive release in M. Lockwood Porter's catalog \u2014 an album that both nods to the past and pushes forward to the future, thanks in part to a full-band attack that lends fire, ferocity, and grit to the tracklist.\n\n\u201cI think the fully collaborative recording process was the biggest musical shift between recording How To Dream Again and Communion In The Ashes,\u201d explains Porter. \u201cJeremy Lyon has been playing in my live band since 2016, but this was the first M. Lockwood Porter album that he\u2019s worked on, and he brought a much wider palette of guitar tones to this album than I've used on past records. This is also the first time I\u2019ve recorded with synthesizers. I had given the band the vague direction that I wanted us to imagine ourselves as a \u2018dystopian gospel band\u2019 before we started recording, and my keyboardist Jeff Hashfield found a sound on his Prophet synthesizer that we ended up dubbing the \u2018Blade Runner church organ.\u2019 We ended up using it on nearly every song.\u201d\n\nThroughout Communion In The Ashes, Porter\u2019s electrifying \u201cdystopian gospel band\u201d explores how frightening our world can be. The record\u2019s enthralling cover art \u2014 designed by William Schaff, known for his longtime association with Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina \u2014 shines a light on that horrifying present, depicting a man (A preacher? An organizer? A demagogue?) addressing a crowd from the foreground of a burning, decaying city. With its Springsteen-sized catharsis, though, Communion in the Ashes offers listeners something new: a soundtrack with which to rise up, rebuild, and renew. Call it protest music if you'd like. Call it a political album if you must. Whatever the description, Communion in the Ashes packs the strongest punch of Porter's career, capturing not just one man's reaction to the present day, but an entire community's opportunity to better their own tomorrows.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2937 Mission, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Danny Castro", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.417887, 37.750037], "Date": "Sun Nov 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Savanna Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Savanna Jazz Jam with Eric Tillman, Danny Castro, and Nick Fishman at Savanna Jazz Club: Savanna stands out in its neighborhood: it's almost as if a North Beach jazz club dropped a spore on Mission Street.

Long gone is the era of artists like Bob Marley, The Clash, Stevie Wonder and Patti Smith getting airplay and bringing their messages to the masses. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the revolution isn\u2019t still brewing in the hearts and minds of many people around the globe.\n\nMeet Mike Love. One of reggae music\u2019s rising stars. Born and raised in Oahu, Hawaii to a musical family that spans generations, Mike Love brings a multitude of influences to the table, all tied together by the common goal of making the world a better place. Through the grassroots method of releasing his albums independently, on his own Love Not War Records label, and performing 250 plus shows a year, Love has built an ever growing following for his unique and inspiring music. He has toured with many artists in the circles of conscious, roots music, including Trevor Hall, Xavier Rudd, Nahko and many more. Over the past few years he performed to enthusiastic audiences at the California Roots Festival, Wakarusa, Wanderlust and the Montreal Jazz Fest, just to name a few. He has also enjoyed great success and exposure through the web on outlets like YouTube, with one of his videos just recently hitting 9 million views!\n\nOn his award winning debut album, The Change I\u2019m Seeking, Love harkens the legends of roots reggae in both his lyrics and his sound, but never relies on any one genre to hold him down. Coming from a wealth of influences, Love fuses the simple rhythms of classic reggae with the complex changes of the classical and rock music he was first trained on to come up with a style wholly unique to him. On his follow up album, Love Will Find A Way, released September 1st, 2015, Love further refines his sound and message, with grand and striking arrangements and deep heartfelt emotions, he takes you on a journey which many describe as \"life changing\". He calls for immediate and drastic change in environmental impact on \"Step Lightly\", affirms his connection with fans on \"I Love You, and shows a vulnerable and touching insight into his personal life on \"Advaya's Song\" and \"No Regrets\". Following up with his most eclectic blend of styles, \"Love Overflowing\" perfectly compliments the previous release, with a downplayed mood of depth and reflection in the music.\n\nBut it\u2019s his message, his passion, the wisdom behind his words that truly resonate with his fans. \u201cIt\u2019s always been about the healing,\u201d Mike Love explains, \u201cI\u2019ve never been into music that was shallow. I\u2019m still learning about where I\u2019m going and where I want to be. All the music is a learning tool for me too. I just make myself open to it and the messages come through. It\u2019s just as teaching and healing for me as it is for anyone.\u201d\n\nHis songs take you on a journey, one of healing and inspiration. One designed to help you on your path to knowledge, wisdom and understanding. On \u201cPermanent Holiday\u201d he takes you on a lyrical quest for freedom, both his and yours. He laments the ills of the world but also discusses solutions and ideas to change them. On \"Earthlings\" he sings about being vegan, about animal cruelty and about holding yourself accountable for your actions. These are songs with messages designed to affect change in a time when it is so desperately necessary.\n\nLove and his band have already toured in the U.S., Canada, Central America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and East Asia. Mike Love has shared the stage with artists like Michael Franti, Trevor Hall, Nahko & Medicine For The People, Xavier Rudd, Rebelution, John Butler Trio, Groundation, Steel Pulse, Dave Matthews and Jack Johnson. 2017 is shaping up to be a big year of even more growth for Love and his musical family with plenty of touring and work on a brand new record!\n\nRevolutionary, Conscious, Music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1419 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Bohemian Knuckle Boogie", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433317, 37.782618], "Date": "Sun Nov 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Sheba Piano Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Bohemian Knuckleboogie at Sheba Piano Lounge: Don't let the hokey exterior fool you, this place offers a comfortable, even classy setting in the heart of the Fillmore.

Formed in July 2013, the ambitious Italian outfit quickly released their inaugural full length album \u201cSpread The Word\u201d on British label Stem Records (May 2014). Soon after, they strike again with the highly acclaimed EP \"Polina\", delivered on Jennifer Cardini's imprint Correspondant, receiving massive support from the likes of Tale of Us, Dixon, Tiga, Agoria, John Digweed, Stephan Bodzin and Miss Kittin. In 2015, the trio's innovative soundscape landed again on the French label with the \u201cEmperor\u201d EP (May) and the single \"Lotus Flower\" on Correspondant's compilation (June). The following year saw another major step with the release, on Maceo Plex\u2019s iconic label Ellum, of their EP \u201cMagma\u201d, whose gem \u201cObsidian\u201d was quickly crowned as an outstanding dancefloor anthem. Their pioneering sound creativity also shines and blazes through when they step into remix duty. Their reworks of \u201cTraces\u201d from the Danish band WhoMadeWho, \u201cZulu\u201d from techno legend Stephan Bodzin or the single \u201cFire on the Moon\u201d from Sailor & I, all demonstrated their stunning capacity for reinterpretation. The uniqueness and complexity of the Agents of Time\u2019s sonic signature arises from a powerful and original blend of electronic, progressive, techno and ambient textures, and is rooted in a creative artistic process which combines meticulous studio work and multiple \"live\" tested performances. The Agents of Time's live act is characterized by the use of analog instruments, making each stage show unpredictable and unique in its kind. Their common desire is to brave limits and to share with others the pulse of enjoyable freedom which led them to perform at internationally recognised festivals (mostly with live acts, but also often DJ sets), such as Amsterdam\u2019s DGTL and ADE, Barcelona\u2019s Off Sonar and Mexico\u2019s BPM Festival, and even with the Tonhalle orchestra of Z\u00fcrich as well as in famous clubs around the globe. This year, the launch of their own label \u201cObscura\u201d, with a strong, magnetic and complex 4-track EP entitled \u201cDay One\u201d opens a further landmark chapter in Agents of Time\u2019s journey of constant self-reinvention.

Produced by Terry Date, Repentless was written and recorded by guitarist Kerry King and singer/bassist Tom Araya at Henson Studios in Los Angeles, along with returning drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Repentless is crushing and brutal, steadfastly refusing to cater to the mainstream. Thirty-four years into its career, Slayer remains the preeminent punk-thrash band that helped establish the genre and that up-and-coming metal heads continue to revere and emulate. Slayer is a five-time nominated, two-time Grammy Award-winning metal juggernaut that writes songs which mirror the turmoil and aberrations of our society. Repentless, the band\u2019s first new album in six years, continues the Slaytanic offensive with a twelve-song, blood-shaking sonic attack. Repentless is dark, fast, aggressive and without mercy. It was also the most challenging record Slayer has ever had to make. In 2013 the world mourned the loss of guitarist Jeff Hanneman who died from complications following a two-year illness. A co-founder of Slayer, losing Jeff was very difficult for the band. During Jeff\u2019s illness, friend of the band, guitarist Holt stepped in to help out on tour with Jeff\u2019s blessing and stayed on. Around that time, drummer Dave Lombardo exited the band for the third time and Paul Bostaph, (who played with the band from 1992 \u2013 2001), returned to take over the throne. Slayer never skipped a beat and since Holt and Bostaph both played in Exodus, it was all-in-the-thrash-family. But it didn\u2019t come easily. As guitarist and Slayer co-founder Kerry King puts it, \u201cI remember the day that Jeff died. It was the day of the Revolver Golden Gods Awards. We knew he\u2019d been sick but nobody expected it to be so quick. I assumed I\u2019d be able to go out there and see him after I got done with whatever business I had to do and that day never came. \u201cWe went out and toured afterwards to see how we felt about it. That\u2019s what you do as a musician: you either go out and tour or you stop working. Even though we\u2019d been touring for two years without Jeff, thinking he was going to come back, now there was finality to it. And the thing with Gary was that we were all friends. Exodus was the first band we\u2019d ever met that became our friends immediately and we stayed friends throughout the years. Gary is just a guitar dynamo and he was the guy.\u201d Tom Araya agrees. \u201cJeff would want us to continue. I\u2019d think that if something were to happen to someone else in the band, whoever it was would feel the same way. Just get on with it. Gary\u2019s a friend, a friend of Jeff\u2019s, he knew what was going on and he wanted to help in any way he could, so Gary made Slayer a comfortable place to be. Having Paul back was also a comforting feeling. He\u2019s a former member and that\u2019s the best thing about it. It wasn\u2019t some other guy. Having Paul and Gary made everything a little easier to handle. It\u2019s about the band. Slayer was a big thing for Jeff, and so I\u2019m looking at it in that sense. It was his baby, too. And we hope we\u2019ve done Slayer and him justice.\u201d King said that Slayer still had to test the water. \u201cNow we were out to see if it made sense to continue, to see if we liked it, to see if the band still enjoyed it. And the way I looked at it was: if it wasn\u2019t this, it was going to be something that sounded exactly like this, so why not continue doing this? It\u2019s super-potent. We\u2019re really tight right now and we\u2019re stoked that we\u2019re still doing it. Once we had that under our belts we started thinking about a record and never looked back.\u201d After two decades with American Recordings, Slayer found a new home with Nuclear Blast, the German independent label known for its metal roster. King is enthusiastic about the move, \u201cI like it,\u201d he declares, stressing the work like. \u201cHaving been with American for so long we wanted to give them first right of refusal because that\u2019s how we are. I think continuity is far stronger than switching all the time. But at the end of the day, Nuclear Blast made us a great offer and so it was time to move on. At Nuclear Blast, people go to work, they do their job, get paid and they fuckin\u2019 like it. All hands. So it was the right choice.\u201d When the time came, Slayer entered the studio with producer Terry Date. Date is the first producer the band has worked with since leaving American, where all their albums were produced or executive produced by Rick Rubin. On working with Date, Tom says, \u201cHe\u2019d done all these great albums \u2013 Soundgarden, Pantera \u2013 and as a singer I need someone I respect who can tell me whether he likes it or not as opposed to telling me how to do something I\u2019ve been doing for 30 years. He would guide me. That\u2019s why I really liked working with him, because he was so cool. I regard him as a friend, for sure.\u201d Kerry adds, \u201cIt was as business as usual as it could be. The oddest thing for me was Jeff\u2019s presence\u2026 not being there. When we were recording, in the past, whether he played or not, having him there and having his opinion and stuff like that: that was what I missed. Jeff\u2019s not being there was the oddest thing.\u201d Gary Holt came on board to help out with tour commitments when Jeff first became ill. \u201cMy role in Slayer started out as a tour and happened to come when I was taking time off from Exodus and I spoke to Kerry who asked if I could help out. I went down to rehearsal and Jeff showed me some things. I\u2019ve known Jeff forever but it wasn\u2019t until his memorial that I learned how much of his blessing I really had. At the end of the day, we all wanted Jeff to come back and then tragedy struck; so here we are five years later and Repentless is coming out and I think Jeff would have loved it. I\u2019m super-excited. It\u2019s a good feeling and I know it\u2019s got to be a great feeling for Tom and Kerry for all the work they\u2019ve done \u2013 and Paul as well. Everybody\u2019s excited.\u201d Repentless marks the return of drummer Paul Bostaph, who was extremely enthusiastic. \u201cBefore I was in the band I was a fan and just because I\u2019m the drummer doesn\u2019t mean I stop being a fan: it just means my tickets are cheaper. After I left in 2002 I never thought I\u2019d be sitting on the drum throne with the band again. This particular style of music delivers something for me, musically and physically, that\u2019s challenging and exciting. I feel better as a player and I\u2019m more mature and the band is maturing and getting better, like fine wine. It feels natural to be back and it\u2019s good to be back with Kerry and Tom. The San Francisco Bay-area metal scene is very tight knit: everybody knows everybody. I consider Slayer to be part of that even though they\u2019re from Southern California. Gary I played together in Exodus and he\u2019s amazing \u2013 one of the godfathers of thrash with Exodus \u2013 so it\u2019s like coming home for me. And we\u2019re having fun and I think if we weren\u2019t having fun we wouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d Repentless marks a number of transitions for the band but with their undisputed attitude, Slayer emerges triumphant, says Tom. \u201cAfter 35 years, the thing that Kerry and I share is our dedication to the band, and Jeff\u2019s included in that. It\u2019s the same with Gary. He\u2019s been doing this a long time and he\u2019s had the same commitment. It\u2019s a common bond we share with a lot of musicians out there. I\u2019m really excited about the new album, we\u2019ve put a lot of work into it, Kerry especially, and it was all for Slayer.\u201d Repentless is loaded with sensational songs, from the hyper-aggressive metallic blasts of the title track, \u201cTake Control\u201d, \u201cImplode\u201d and \u201cAtrocity Vendor\u201d to the ferocious thrash pounding of \u201cVices\u201d \u201cWhen The Stillness Comes\u201d and \u201cPride In Prejudice\u201d the album is Slayer through and through. For Paul Bostaph it\u2019s simple: \u201cThe songs are awesome.\u201d Tom puts it bluntly, \u201cThis is definitely Slayer. No one will be disappointed with what we\u2019ve done.\u201d For Kerry King, the feeling is mutual. \u201cMusically for me \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not an \u201cI told ya so\u201d because Jeff\u2019s not a part of it \u2013 but I do know that a lot of people assumed Slayer\u2019s not going to be functional with Dave not being here and Jeff never being here again. But we did it and it fuckin\u2019 sounds like Slayer \u2013 period.\u201d Slayer's place in music history is secure as one of The Big Four (alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax): they helped define the thrash-metal genre. With Repentless Kerry, Tom, Paul and Gary affirm that Slayer is unstoppable. Slayer continues fearlessly, aggressively and without contrition; and most importantly, fucking Slayer still rules!

He\u2019s highly opinionated, exceptionally well read and articulate on subjects ranging from politics to alien conspiracies to American history to his beloved Chicago Blackhawks/Bulls/White Sox/Bears. He is an avid follower of NASA scientist David S. McKay, ancient civilizations scholar Zecharia Sitchin, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Scottish writer/archaeologist/scientist Graham Hancock. During a layover at the Las Vegas airport this past summer, Jourgensen spotted U.S. Congressman Adam Schiff, introduced himself, and took full advantage of the encounter to let the Congressman know of his views on tax reform and the possible perils of redistribution of wealth, the current obstruction of the \u201cRussia-gate\u201d investigation by the House Intelligence Committee lead by Republican Chair Devin Nunes, and to inquire about the status of the possible impeachment of the President, on not only obstruction and collusion charges, but for treason.\n\nYou see, Al Jourgensen is angry, really angry about what\u2019s going on in America - sexual abuse and the disrespect of women in our society, the waning respect for the U.S. Constitution, the growing acceptance of one's opinions replacing facts, the decline of the our leaders\u2019 sense of morals, ethics and personal responsibility to the country and to their constituents, and the mad man in the White House. Yeah, Al is angry, and that takes us straight to Ministry\u2019s upcoming album AmeriKKKant.\n\nBefore all of that, the industrial machine that is Ministry has manufactured immense amounts of sound during its 30+ years of musical artistry. Initially coming into existence in 1981, Ministry was to be the lifetime passion project of front runner and founder Al Jourgensen. Often associated with ideas and imagery that are easily recognized today, in part because of Jourgensen\u2019s insanely dreaded hair, pitch black attire, vampiric glasses, and exquisite top hat, the band has become incredibly symbolic. But like any creature cursed with the gift of creativity, \u201cUncle Al\u201d has shed his skin several times over the decades. The development of Ministry and all of Al Jourgensen projects has been purely organic, which is a huge reason why the masses following his projects are so vast.\n\nOften referred to as one of the founders of Industrial Music, the true outlook of Ministry as well as Jourgensen's other projects, is far more fluid than just one specific genre. Surgical Meth Machine, Revolting Cocks, and anything Al \u201cFucking\u201d Jourgensen has produced all explore different realms of sound and thought.\n\nIn the year 1981 in Chicago Illinois, Ministry was initially born. With an original line up of Al Jourgensen doing lead vocals, guitar, programming and overall production, Stephen George on drums, Robert Roberts on keyboards and backing vocals, and John Davis also on keyboards and backing vocals. New sounds were constantly being developed in the 80\u2019s especially as technology improved. At first the band had a very catchy, synth-pop sound. They began by releasing four 12\u201d singles on Wax Track! Records starting in 1981, and released their first LP \u201cWith Sympathy\u201d in 1983 via Arista Records.\n\nAs time progressed however, so did Ministry, and they quickly developed a harsher, and even more stylized industrial sound that they soon became infamous for. In the mid to late 80\u2019s the band gained a progressively greater following as it released albums Twitch (1986), The Land of Rape and Honey (1988), and The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste (1989). The darker, heavier sound that Ministry had developed into was often a direct reflection upon modern concepts, society, and politics. It was also during this time that Al Jourgensen himself reached one of his many peaks of creativity and branched off into what would be one of his many side-projects: Revolting Cocks. He also began producing a vast amount of other music by artists similar to his realm in one way or another such as Nivek Ogre/Skinny Puppy, The Reverend Horton Heat, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins, Cheap Trick and Red Hot Chili Peppers. With the release of Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and The Way to Suck Eggs (1992), Ministry hit an all time high in the mainstream musical realm and even received a Grammy nomination. Filth Pig was released in 1994 and by then Ministry had not only grown a solid fanbase, but a solid reputation as well.\n\nFamous for a hellaciously unique talent and sound, pure heinous insanity while on tour, and endless energy filled performances at countless festivals, Ministry had developed a cult following and would go on to release several more records throughout the years before eventually taking a hiatus. On December 23rd, 2012 then guitarist Mike Scaccia suffered a heart attack and passed away. It was not long after this that Jourgensen took what was to be an indefinite leave from doing anything Ministry related as he could not bare to continue without Scaccia. It wasn\u2019t until recently that Jourgensen decided that if the circumstances were right, he would consider reawakening Ministry to release something new to the world.\n\nNow, in 2017 Ministry has reunited, revamped its line-up, signed to Nuclear Blast Records, recently returned from a full world tour, and is now preparing to release their 14th studio album, AmeriKKKant, on March 9th 2018. Society and Politics have taken a turn for the insane and frightening in the United States and across the globe, leaving much inspiration and frustration for Ministry to draw from. Jourgensen remembers his shock while witnessing everyone and everything around him during the recent election process, and awoke on the morning of November 9th 2016 proclaiming: \u201cWe are making a fuckin\u2019 album - right now.\u201d\n\nAmeriKKKant, like all Ministry projects, is an organic reflection of not just the band\u2019s talent and sounds, but of the society in which we all live and breathe. Jourgensen says \u201cI\u2019ve spoken my piece on the societal conditions that would elect such a blithering idiot. It\u2019s not an anti-Trump album, it\u2019s like a- \u2018did you pay attention in School? Does anybody have any intellectual curiosity anymore?\u2019- album. [It\u2019s] basically just holding up a mirror to ourselves and saying: \u2018Look at this, is this what you really want to be?\u2019\u201d\n\nWith a new line up, incredibly full sound, and some might say a return to the roots of Ministry, the band is prepared to release a record that is socially relevant and sonically effective. Fans can look forward to a hearty future for not just Ministry, but Surgical Meth Machine, and Revolting Cocks as well. There is simply too much insanity in this world for Jourgensen not to speak his mind and keep our senses alive with his vast array of decibels and visuals: \u201cI\u2019m afraid for the stupidity of not embracing nonsense. I think nonsense is a great escape from the rigors of being in life\u2019s hamster wheel.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Amazing Grace", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Tue Nov 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-26", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Hardcore Punk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "*Films at The Freight: Amazing Grace"}, {"Address": "476 Castro St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Kally Price", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.435403, 37.761304], "Date": "Tue Nov 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Blush!

Whether it be launching clothing and jewelry lines or attending art school, he constantly bobbed and weaved past expectations. As a rapper, unpredictability remains his only calling card. The next member of the A$AP Mob collective to have a solo project, he can slip from gruff, gritty rhymes to soaring singing, and he does so seamlessly. On his A$AP Worldwide released mixtape, Trap Lord, he's got his own musical domain on lock. \u201cFerg's debut [mixtape] will not sound like anything that's out in the music industry right now,\u201d assures A$AP Worldwide co-owner, A$AP Yams. Hip-hop surrounded Ferg from childhood. His father Darold Ferguson owned a Harlem boutique and printed shirts and logos for record labels including Bad Boy Records and luminaries such as Teddy Riley, Heavy D, Bell Biv DeVoe, and more. Even though he immersed himself in music, the younger Ferg pursued fashion at first. Launching Devoni Clothing in 2005, he designed and distributed high-end belts worn by the likes of Chris Brown, Swizz Beatz, and Diggy Simmons. Eventually, his hustle, creativity, and business acumen extended to music. \"Trapping means hustling,\" he explains. \"I went from painting to making clothes to rapping. I always put myself into everything I do one hundred percent. It doesn't matter what I'm working on. I want to perfect everything I do. Success is the only option. They call me \u2018Trap Lord\u2019 because my hustle game is impeccable.\" Friends since high school, A$AP Rocky recognized that \"impeccable hustle game\" and pushed Ferg to get behind the mic as much as possible. In 2010, they teamed up for the viral hits \"Get High,\" \"Kissin' Pink,\" and explosive \"Ghetto Symphony\" from Rocky's chart-topping major label 2013 debut LONG.LIVE.A$AP. \"Rocky is a major reason I'm rapping,\" he reveals. \"He believes in me and really challenges me. We look up to each other, and I consider him a brother.\" The world got its formal introduction to Ferg on the inimitable and irresistible \"Work.\" His first single resounds with gutter-fabulous production from Chinza & Fly\u2014who he actually found on tumblr while touring with Rocky on Drake's Club Paradise Tour. His impenetrable flow charges through a smoky synth haze, rising to the forefront. Upon its release, the music video quickly racked up over 2 million online views and was dubbed one of the \"50 Best Songs of 2012\" by tastemaker Complex.com. About \"Work,\" Ferg goes on, \"Lyrically, it's truth. It's a motivational song. I speak where I come from. I wanted talk about real life shit, and that's what it does. You've got to put in that work.\" Also in his arsenal is the sharp and slick \"Dump Dump.\" \"That was inspired by a night in a NYC club,\" he laughs. \"We're going to leave it at that. I was there dodging glasses and stuff.\" Then, he offers a soulful rumination on life and death, \"100 Million Roses.\" After seeing the film Selena, he became infatuated with the legendary Latina icon and he researched her legacy, learning as much as he possibly could about her. Dedicating the song to Selena and everyone else he's lost personally, Ferg's honesty hits hard. \"She's had such an inspiring story. I dedicated '100 Million Roses' to her and my dad. I wonder how people would look at my life when I die, and that's what the verse is about. How would people feel? I know I'd want a 100 million roses.\" Ultimately, Ferg is beginning to leave his own legacy with Trap Lord. \"I hope people take the good and the bad from what I've got to say,\" he concludes. \"I've seen so much shit in my life. There were times I ducked bullets at a basketball game, and then I went to a fashion show. I've experienced depression. I've experienced triumph. I've experienced hate. I've experienced love. You can't hide from this shit though. It builds your character. I learned how to be independent.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Thus, life came hard and fast at the members of SoCal pop-punk trio, whose meteoric success in the late \u201890s and early millennium ingrained their anthemic radio hits into the fabric of the lives of a whole generation. Then, it all sort of ended\u2026until now.\n\n\n\nReunited and re-energized, the band is returning with new album Speak In Code eight years after parting ways in 2004. As the fourth full-length release for Eve 6 and their debut on new label Fearless Records, the album heralds not just a return to form for the threesome, but a new chapter in a book that had ended all too abruptly.\n\n\n\n\u201cOverall I'm really proud of it, and I think we're doing right by our fans, who\u2019ve waited a long time for us to make another record. I think we're giving them something they'll enjoy,\u201d says singer/bassist Max Collins. \u201cOnce we got in the studio there was a lot of energy. There aren't any filler moments; each song has its purpose. This is the strongest collection of songs we've ever had on one record.\u201d\n\n\n\nEve 6\u2014which also includes drummer Tony Fagenson and guitarist Jon Siebels\u2014formed in Southern California in 1995 while the trio were just teenagers, then inked a deal with RCA Records before they\u2019d finished high school. The band issued the self-titled Eve 6 in 1998, attaining platinum success with hit singles \u201cInside Out\u201d and \u201cLeech,\u201d the former capturing the #1 spot on the Modern Rock charts and crossing over successfully to Top 40 radio. More widespread recognition came with gold-selling sophomore effort Horrorscope (2000), which spawned radio gems \u201cPromise,\u201d \u201cOn The Roof Again\u201d and the ubiquitous prom and MTV anthem \u201cHere\u2019s To The Night\u201d.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like Eve 6 were everywhere\u2014the band made appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Late Night With Conan O\u2019Brien, and TRL with Carson Daly, with their videos in constant rotation on MTV. The band then released the more experimental It\u2019s All In Your Head in 2003, featuring singles \u201cThink Twice\u201d and \u201cAt Least We\u2019re Dreaming,\u201d but parted ways with RCA thereafter. Their rapid rise to prominence at an early age had led to an inevitable mental and physical exhaustion, and in 2004 Eve 6 announced an indefinite hiatus. It was time to turn a new page.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were parts which were fucking incredible, and amazing and awesome, and there were aspects that were terrifying and freaky that you don't know how to handle. I feel like we did some growing up in public,\u201d says Collins. \u201cI needed to stop drinking. In order to do that, the wheels had to come off. I don't think I could have done it if the band was still going.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a year apart, Collins and Fagenson began writing and producing for other artists, including 2007\u2019s hit ballad \u201cWe Don\u2019t Have To Look Back Now\u201d for rock band Puddle of Mudd, and collaborating on a new experimental side project, the Sugi Tap. \"It was an inspiring time, going down different musical avenues together and trying things we wouldn't have in Eve 6,\u201d reflects Fagenson. \u201cIronically, when we did reform Eve 6 a couple years later, those experiments allowed us to progress the sound of the band more freely than if we had been in the band the whole time.\"\n\n\n\nCollins and Fagenson eventually reignited Eve 6 in 2008, with guitarist Matt Bair temporarily replacing Siebels who was occupied with his project Monsters Are Waiting. The band spent the next two-plus years touring, writing and reconnecting with fans, then in 2011, armed with new material and management, signed with Fearless Records. A month within inking the deal Collins and Fagenson finally convinced Siebels to return to the fold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter going down some different paths it hit me that there was this thing out there that people wanted and wanted to hear,\u201d explains Siebels. \u201cIt just clicked and made sense to me. After such a long break I was so happy to be playing with these guys again.\u201d Continues Fagenson, \"The way [Siebels] hits the strings and puts that muscle into the chords is very distinctive to our band, and that was a welcome piece of the sound that we had missed. Songs that had been kicking around for a couple years got new life with his playing put into them.\u201d\n\n\n\nEve 6 then re-enlisted Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Dashboard Confessional, Good Charlotte, Pearl Jam)\u2014who produced the first two Eve 6 full-lengths\u2014to helm the sessions for Speak In Code. With all the lead time, the album contains a mix of compositions that began as far back as the side project, as well as recent works written in the months leading up to the recording process. \u201cWe were really taking a \u2018best of everything\u2019 sort of approach, almost like a band's first album, in which there's a lot of material to choose from,\u201d Fagenson notes. \u201cAbout half the songs were standouts from what Max and I had been working on and demoing over the years, and the other half were newer ideas that came with the inspiration of Jon's return and all that was happening to us at the time. We have a unique process, where each song is sort of its own animal. Don was crucial in helping us tighten everything up, and inspiring Max to dig really deep lyrically and get to some root emotion down there.\u201d Explains Collins, \u201cNeil Finn [of Crowded House] once said, \u2018A great producer is someone whom you admire musically and otherwise, who you feel compelled to show up and show off for.\u2019 I feel like Don is that figure for me and the band.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn many ways, Speak In Code is a work with deep personal significance for Collins, who has weathered his share of personal adversity. The album is a testament to coming out okay on the other side, with friendships still intact, but it\u2019s within the journey that the story truly lies. Whether it\u2019s romantic relationships or dealings with his bandmates, communication\u2014and its barriers\u2014is a central theme underpinning the release.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn some of the songs frustration is a theme. I was sort of looking at difficult personal relationships with a humorous spin in some places, and with more earnestness in others,\u201d explains Collins. \u201cThe title [Speak In Code] is a lyric from \u2018Curtain,\u2019 and there was something kind of evocative about it. In that song, I'm referring to being newly sober and just feeling like an open nerve, feeling freaked out, having people and life being sort of overwhelming. It's almost like people are speaking a language you don't understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nOpening track \u201cCurtain\u201d is a pivotal moment for several reasons\u2014not only does it provide a title concept, but it also speaks to the group\u2019s return from hiatus, drawing on the relations between the notoriously volatile Gallagher brothers from Britpop icons Oasis. \u201cThere was a lot that I could identify with there,\u201d Collins says. \u201cBeing in a band is like a marriage; it's like a family. You're in the trenches with these guys, and sometimes it's easy and awesome, and sometimes it's not so easy.\u201d\n\n\n\nFirst single \u201cVictoria\u201d lyrically weaves a tale that draws the listener into a hook-laden, 80\u2018s-influenced anthem, putting a contemporary spin on the classic Eve 6 sound. \u201c[\u2018Victoria\u2019] indulges this paranoid what-if fantasy that kind of has a foot in the truth: My wife went on this girls\u2019 vacation to Mexico, and when I was looking through the photos, I saw my imagination start to go, and wrote that song,\u201d Collins recalls. \u201cI'm convinced in my mind that something\u2019s going on that really isn't.\u201d\n\n\n\nFar from being just some nefarious nostalgia cash-in, Speak In Code is a genuine example of triumphing over one\u2019s obstacles, both professionally and personally, seven years in the making. Eve 6 say the time rebuilding was essential to regaining their footing, which seems more solid in 2012 than ever. \"In a lot of ways, the years leading up to this album release was a bit of a \u2018paying our dues\u2019 situation. We certainly had to earn the right to have this opportunity again,\u201d says Fagenson. \u201cThis time around I think we realized just how hard it is to really get a rock band going and just when you think you're near the finish line you realize there's another hundred miles to go. But all that work and time simply strengthened our belief in what we were doing, and it was a crucial aspect of our development. It really taught us about stick-with-it-ness and perseverance.\"\n\n\n\n\"The time we spent apart really made us appreciate what we have in each other. It's a chemistry you can't manufacture,\u201d adds Collins. \u201cWe literally grew up playing music together. The bond that we have as a result of so much shared experience infuses the sound of the band.\"\n\n\n\nWith 'Speak In Code' slated for an April 24th release, the band is gearing up for their much-awaited reintroduction to fans. Now part of the Fearless Records family, it\u2019s a guarantee Eve 6\u2019s music will reach a wide, eager audience of potential devotees, and a full slate of touring behind the release is slated for 2012. Diehards who caught the band live in prior years will undoubtedly be thrilled to see the trio once again on stage, but it will be a somewhat older, definitely wiser group that greets them. According to Collins, it\u2019s all good.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to playing new songs, and reconnecting to the fans with new material,\u201d says Collins. \u201cI feel this profound gratitude to the other two guys in my band. We've been through a lot\u2014we've had the mountaintop moments and the Death Valley moments\u2014and we're still here today, we all get along, and we made this thing together. It's almost miraculous, to me. There's this convergence that goes on for something that's bigger than the sum of its parts, and that's such a joyful, cool fucking thing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:00pm // Show 8:00pm // All Ages // $24 Advance & $29 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero West, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Alma Matters", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Tue Nov 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Alma Matters"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Between Kings", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8558320.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Tue Nov 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-26", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Alternative Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "Brisbane, Australia post-alternative rock outfit Between Kings play with an immediacy that has been missing from most modern rock.

The Story Begins opens with the tastefully orchestrated overture of the title track on which Phillip dispatches the plaintive tenor to baritone realms of his vocal range for an introspective directive on seizing the day in life. It is followed by the equally uplifting \u201cChocolate Child,\u201d words of spiritual nourishment for the youth of today \u2013\nespecially young Black American Kings and Queens - blessed with the bluesy tang of Phil Gates\u2019 guitar and Phillip\u2019s vocal delivery that channels the legendary Sammy Davis, Jr. and soul-jazz prophet Gregory Porter. \u201cMr. Porter gave me the most current inspiration to do what I do,\u201d Phillip confirms. \u201cHe once stated that it was his hope that he had opened a door for others to be unique. I hope one day to sing with him.\u201d On the song, Phillip adds, \u201cUnderstanding the importance of the seeds we plant early in the heads of our young, I\u2019m telling them, \u2018You\u2019re magnificent\u2026 You come\nfrom royalty...Know that and live that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cChocolate Child\u201d is one of five selections that Phillip had the good fortune to co-compose with highly prolific and immensely successful songwriter/producer Preston Glass (Natalie Cole, Aretha Franklin, George Benson, Kenny G). In all, Glass produced seven of the CD\u2019s songs. From the luscious piano ballad \u201cA Funny Thing Happened (On the Way To Goodbye)\u201d to the tender Tropicana of the Stevie Wonder-esque \u201cLooking For You (In Somebody Else\u2019s Eyes),\u201d the signature sheen emanating from Glass\u2019 Platinum Garage workshop proves a brilliant no-brainer fit for Phillip. \u201cMy mother is the one who told me I should try a session with Preston,\u201d Phillip relays. \u201cThe magic was instant\u2026smooth as butter with a great flow of energy.\u201d Glass concurs. \u201cThe richness of Phillip\u2019s vocal chords provides him a charismatic advantage. What sets him apart from others who possess similar richness (such as Will Downing) is his theatrical experience which he draws from liberally in his interpretation of a lyric. Phillip is a talent to be reckoned with. I enjoyed collaborating with him.\u201d\n\nLove wafts seductive in other highlights of The Story Begins including the jazz-kissed \u201cStay in the Moment\u201d (Brenda Davis - Phillip\u2019s Mom) is the featured vocalist), a cover of the mighty Luther Vandross\u2019 \u201cWait For Love\u201d (key Phillip line: \u201cI never stopped believing\u201d), the mysterious spiritual wavelengths of \u201cMystic Bleu,\u201d the bass-driven funk message \u201cBest of You,\u201d the rousing high-steppin\u2019 James Brown groove \u201cCome On,\u201d and the epic wedding song \u201cThe Promise\u201d (one of three songs overseen by producer DrFord). \u201c\u2018The Promise\u2019 was inspired by so many of my friends getting\nmarried coupled with my parents\u2019 beautiful marriage of 37 years,\u201d Phillip shares. The treasure includes this wonderful lyric,\n\nYou are the precious stone that a miner would have alone\nAnd take back with the pride of a gem that\u2019s by his side\n\nPhillip Brandon is the Los Angeles-born product of the divinely yoked marriage of Phillip & Brenda Davis. Dad is a big-time jazz lover who took Phillip to his first concert: George Benson. Mom, better known as \u201cMs. B,\u201d is a former Raelettes backup singer for the immortal Ray Charles with whom she travelled the world, bringing back tales of wonder to young Phillip. \u201cI\u2019ve always appreciated the old school showmanship of groups like Earth Wind & Fire, the O\u2019Jays and Whispers. When I attend a show, I\nexpect a performance! I\u2019ll never forget the first time I saw Maze featuring Frankie Beverly. Everyone knew all the songs and came away with a good feeling. It was an experience.\u201d\n\nDespite family roots, Phillip didn\u2019t intend to follow in his mother\u2019s footsteps. He attended Venice High School, an international magnet high school where he studied Japanese. He next attended Atlanta\u2019s historical Morehouse College on a partial scholarship that required him to tour with their glee club. \u201cWe went on tour every spring singing classical repertoire and Negro Spirituals. I love travel so a light bulb went off over my head! I didn\u2019t go to school for music, It\u2019s just in me.\u201d\n\nPhillip graduated with a degree in marketing but as the millennium took its turn he took part in singing competitions. \u201cI started seeing more of the world singing in an a cappella group on cruise ships. When I sang, people often asked if I would read lines for them which led me to theater purely by happenstance,\u201d Phillip confesses. \u201cI did Disney Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018The Lion King\u2019 and then a national tour of \u2018The Color Purple\u2019 playing the roles of \u2018Preacher\u2019 and \u2018Ol Mister\u2019. Again, by chance, a scout for multi-platinum-selling rock group Trans Siberian Orchestra saw me singing \u2018Be Prepared\u2019\nin a YouTube video. I have since been with them for eight years as their \u2018Narrator,\u2019 touring sold out arenas from Seattle to Miami every November to January.\u201d\n\nItching to share some expressions from his own heart \u2013 \u201cto get some of this crazy out of my head,\u201d he laughs - Phillip put together a self-titled five-song EP with producer DrFord in 2013 that got him on the smooth jazz charts with the single, \u201cSail On.\u201d This also gave him an opportunity to road test his cherry-picked band of top tier musicians from all over the world: drummer Victor \u00c1. Carracedo from Spain, guitarist Eugene Gorskiy from Ukraine, keyboardist Stan Loken from America, and bassist Carlitos\nCuba\u2026from Cuba! To date they have performed primarily in intimate theatre settings on the west coast in California, Nevada and Arizona, with a couple of stops in New York City.\n\nRecently wrapping a role in \u201cBorn For This: The Musical\u201d - the life story of Gospel legend BeBe Winans directed by \u201cMotown: The Musical\u201d\u2019s Charles Randolph-Wright with Donald Lawrence as Music Supervisor - Phillip Brandon is operating with deep gratitude as he prepares to embark upon the journey of sharing with the world his amazing debut CD, The Story Begins.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it: I\u2019m a big black dude with a big voice,\u201d Phillip concludes. \u201cI can't tiptoe anywhere! I am truly unapologetic about the space that I take up and am extremely thankful to the strong foundation of support that has allowed me to be successful for 10 years and counting in this business; In this era that has had some challenging moments for folks that look like me, the silver lining is, \u2018Look how far we have come.\u2019 I am always about some hope. (Singer-Songwriter) Richard Marx once said, \u2018When you\u2019re creating, you have to be selfish to share what\u2019s on your mind and hope it\u2019s on the minds others\u2019 as well.\u2019 That\u2019s me to a T.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Phillip Brandon on tour with the multi platinum rock group Trans Siberian Orchestra as the \"Storyteller.\""}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Murda Beatz", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618223.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Tue Nov 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-26", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Hip-hop, HipHop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "A$AP Ferg - FLOOR SEATS TOUR"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "The Pickin' Pear", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7908942.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Tue Nov 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-26", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Folk Rock, String Bands, Bluegrass, Rockn Roll, Americana", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "Tia Martini and Leon Elam - The Pickin\u2019 Pear - branch out from Canyon Collected to create a new folk 'n' roll duo.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Further building upon the thrilling metallic hybrid honed across six full-lengths, Two Paths is simultaneously the Finnish quintet\u2019s most epic and far-reaching collection and their most organic, which definitely sets it apart from the pack. \u201cWhen we made One Man Army (2015) we wanted it to sound more like a live album than a traditional studio album. With Two Paths we took that to the next level with analog recording, cutting down tracks and even recording songs without a click, and because of that there is a totally different kind of groove compared to most modern metal albums,\u201d states bassist/vocalist Sami Hinkka. While their ideas are huge and they consistently prove they have the talent to back them up, the band maintain the grounded MO that has served them so well over the years, with the results speaking for themselves. \u201cIt all comes down to writing music that sounds good to us and is fun to play live, and I would say with Two Paths we\u2019ve done everything better than we ever have before.\u201d\n\nWith One Man Army standing as the band\u2019s most accomplished effort to date, going into the process of following it up the members were able to place faith in the intuition of each other, all driven to deliver the best record they could. For Hinkka, Markus Toivonen (guitar/vocals), Petri Lindroos (vocals/guitar) and Janne Parviainen (drums), this trust has steadily grown and strengthened with every release, and this same respect was also extended to former Turisas accordionist Netta Skog, who became a full-time member of Ensiferum in 2016. \u201cNetta started with us as a tour replacement for Emmi (Silvennoinen, keyboards/vocals), so when Emmi wanted to step aside for good it was really natural to ask if she would be interested to join as a full-time member.\u201d As world champion of digital accordion, fans concerned that they may not be able to play their older songs sans keyboard are quickly reassured once they catch her in action. \u201cDigital accordion is exactly like a keyboard with all the possible and impossible sounds, but with a different kind of \u2018user interface\u2019, and Netta really knows her stuff! She comes from a different kind of musical background, and besides being an amazing performer, virtuoso with her instrument and world class singer she is also full of creative ideas, so her input for Two Paths was really important.\u201d\n\nNever rushing to finish songs, Two Paths includes some that were first demoed seven years ago, and due to the care and attentiveness the band invest in everything they do they maintain an enviably high standard. It is also a record with energy to spare, practically daring the listener to resist being caught up in its infectious liveliness. Whether it\u2019s the breakneck, ultra-catchy thrashings of \u201cFor Those About To Fight For Metal\u201d or \u201cKing Of Storms\u201d, the crunchy stomp of \u201cI Will Never Kneel\u201d or the surging thunder of the title track, they never fail to grip, and when they slow things down \u2013 as on the cinematic \u201cHail To The Victor\u201d \u2013 they somehow manage to sound even bigger. Likewise, the grandiose, heroic themes that have always run through Ensiferum\u2019s records feature in the lyrics, and while the theme of Two Paths \u2013 the choices we make, and the consequences of these decisions \u2013 also factor into this, Hinkka always prefers leaving things open to interpretation by the individual listener. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s really important that all lyrics have deeper, more serious and sometimes very personal meaning, while also fitting Ensiferum\u2019s heroic theme. It\u2019s a nice challenge to write lyrics this way, but it\u2019s also really rewarding to hear fans\u2019 interpretations of our music. There is no right or wrong in this matter.\u201d However, more literally taking the concept of Two Paths to heart, the record also includes two different versions of standout tracks \u201cDon\u2019t You Say\u201d and \u201cGod Is Dead\u201d. \u201cEven though Ensiferum has always had clean vocals and choirs, harsh vocals have been the main style, and those songs worked so well with both styles that we decided to include both versions. Everyone can choose which version they enjoy listening to the most \u2013 and this will add a nice twist for upcoming tours: which version shall we be playing each evening?\u201d\n\nHaving developed such a strong working relationship with producer Anssi Kippo (Children Of Bodom) with One Man Army, reuniting for its successor was the obvious choice. Everyone finding themselves on the same page when it came to what they were looking for, the sessions \u2013 while regularly stretched out over twelve hours \u2013 went smoothly. \u201cAnssi has a really great recording method, in that he wants to find the best possible sound and tone for drums, bass, guitars, vocals etcetera at the start, so that as you finish the individual tracks it\u2019s close to what you want the final sound of the album to be. That way, you don\u2019t have to ponder over what you can do in the mixing.\u201d With Mikko P. Mustonen again handling orchestral arrangements and Lassi Logren returning to play nyckelharpa and violin on a few songs, Hinkka is more than happy that they brought \u201cmore bombastic orchestral and down to earth folk aspects\u201d to the record, further fleshing out their vision. This also applies to the contribution of Gyula Havancs\u00e1k, who provided the artwork for both Two Paths and One Man Army. \u201cIt was really nice to work with him again because he always wants to hear our ideas and then he adds his own magic and improvements to them, and the result is always astonishing.\u201d\n\n\nAs is typically the case, Ensiferum will be entering into an extensive touring campaign in support of the record, their calendar already full for the next year. Having accomplished so much since dropping their self-titled debut full-length back in 2001 their appetite has not dulled, wanting to reach more and more people with every successive release, yet they remain characteristically grounded. \u201cI guess everyone who starts to play music will dream at some point of playing music they made for massive crowds, but I never believed that this would be a dream that would come true for me. We have achieved a lot and hopefully there is still much more to achieve. We are really privileged to be in this situation and we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without the right people on our side, all the intensive touring we have done, but most of all our loyal and crazy fans around the world.

Shortly after it\u2019s release, without the aide of publicists or a large label\u2019s bankroll, it won \u201cBest Country Album of 2012\u2033 from The Nashville Scene, the same honor at the Independent Music Awards, a cameo on NPR\u2019s American Routes, and as JP says \u201ca whole mess of other stuff in the papers and on the internet.\u201d (Two songs were also licensed to the soundtrack of 2012\u2019s \u201cAt Any Price,\u201d starring Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron.) His latest album \u201cHome Is Where The Hurt Is\u201d (produced by Harris, guitarist Adam Meisterhans, and engineer Justin Francis) was recorded and mixed at Ronnie\u2019s Place (formerly the personal studio of Ronnie Milsap) at home in Nashville. It features not your typical Music Row studio musicians, but young local players, many of whom have spent thousands of miles on the road in JP\u2019s backing band The Tough Choices. Lending a hand on the album vocally is friend and local Indie-Country star Nikki Lane, as well as long-time friend Chance McCoy, singer and guitarist of Old Crow Medicine Show (McCoy also took rhythm guitar and fiddle duties throughout the album.) Rolling Stone named JP Harris one of fall 2014\u2019s \u201cCountry Tours Not To Miss,\u201d as well as one of \u201c21 Must-See Country Acts at SXSW 2015.\u201d When he isn\u2019t touring, JP can usually be found repairing an old house, splitting wood in his backyard, or digging through the trash for useable refuse. http://www.ilovehonkytonk.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Vinyl", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6390417.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Wed Nov 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-27", "Genre": "Genres: Subterranean Pop Culture, Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Hawkins had some tea brewing.

Their effortless transition into the digital age, complemented by their effortless chic, has garnered the group over 30 million streams and 26 million plus YouTube views on their Top 6 hit singles alone; smashes such as Hold On, Free Your Mind, Never Gonna Get It, Giving Him Something He Can Feel, Don\u2019t Let Go, and Whatta Man (feat. Salt N Pepa).\n\nIn April 2018, the group will present their most diverse work yet with the release of the album \u201cElectric Caf\u00e9.\u201d \u201cWe were just looking for a vibe,\u201d says founding member Cindy Herron-Braggs of the group\u2019s first studio album since 2004. \u201cIn the beginning, we were feeling that electronic dance sound, but then the music started to evolve creatively.\u201d Electric Caf\u00e9 features collaborations with some of today\u2019s most sought-after producers and artists, including Ne-Yo, who penned the lead single Rocket with production by Curtis \"Sauce\" Wilson and Raphael Saadiq, who wrote and produced the smoking hot track, I\u2019m Good.\n\nThe Hip-Hop laced Have a Seat ft. Snoop Dogg was penned by writer/producer Taura Stinson, and the group\u2019s original production duo, Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy, tapped back into En Vogue\u2019s signature sound with D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and Blue Skies.\n\nKnown for their show stopping performances, En Vogue stays in demand. 2018 kicks off with a European tour hitting Dublin, Ireland followed by shows throughout the United Kingdom, Holland and Germany.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a time when we didn\u2019t have a show on the books,\u201d says founding member Terry Ellis. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed to have a global fan base that gives us so much love, so much genuine enthusiasm, every time we walk out on that stage.\u201d\n\nThe ladies attribute their stellar figures and age-defying looks to a primarily plant-based diet and vigorous fitness routine. For them, the ability to consistently deliver high-energy performances is paramount; it is also what keeps their legions of fans wanting more. Simply put, \u201cWe just love our craft,\u201d says Cindy Herron-Braggs.\n\nWhile the seasoned songbirds stay connected to their R&B roots, their appreciation for diverse musical genres is reflected in their new project. \u201cWe love the authenticity of Hip Hop and the fusion of old school rhythm with a contemporary sound,\u201d says Rhona Bennett.\n\nWhen not on the road, they donate their time to philanthropic causes such as The HollyRod Foundation, which provides medical, physical, and emotional support to families living with autism and individuals battling Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also support non-profit organizations that rescue victims from human trafficking and provide them with educational and job training.\n\nSince their debut En Vogue has set the standard for female R&B/Pop groups and promise to continue that tradition with Electric Caf\u00e9.

He has been described as \u2018a man who lives, breathes and emanates everything that is beautiful about deep house music and classic garage.\u2019 David is considered a \u2018rising star\u2019 within the dance community.\u2019 With influences varying from Barry White and the Love Unlimited Orchestra, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, Quincy Jones, the Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder, Parliament Funkadelic, the Isley Brothers and First Choice, among others it's easy to see why funk and soul have always been strong elements in his sound. In 1990, David began DJ\u2019ing at the After Dark in his hometown of Monterey, California. As his popularity grew past the boundaries of Monterey, he was invited to establish a residency at Tilt and the Sound Factory in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\n1994, David opened and DJ\u2019ed at the popular club Lift at Club Dv8 (today known as Temple) in San Francisco. His success as a club DJ led to a DJ spot on commercial radio. David joined the popular radio show Your Mama\u2019s House on the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s number one radio station 106KMEL FM. Your Mama\u2019s House was the only \u2018true\u2019 house mix show on any major radio station in Northern California. As part of the Your Mama\u2019s House crew, David played a key role in exposing the masses to House Music in the San Francisco Bay Area till 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n1995 David kicked off a seven year residency at San Francisco \u2018s legendary Club Universe \u2014 San Francisco\u2019s hottest Saturday night party. At Club Universe, David had the opportunity to play with many legendary DJs like Frankie Knuckles, Tony Humphries, Little Louie Vega, Tedd Patterson, Dave Morales, Danny Teneglia, London\u2019s Simon Dunmore & Aaron Ross, Los Angeles\u2019 Marques Wyatt, San Francisco\u2019s Miguel Migs, Mark Farina and Kaskade, Quentin Harris, Dennis Ferrer, DJ Spen, Timmy Regisford, Doc Martin, Osunlade, Danny Krivit, Joe Clausell, Derrick Carter Mr. V, Kenny Dope, DJ Spinna\u2014 just to name a few. His growing popularity accelerated David\u2019s natural progression into production. In 1998, he released a CD for Universe Sounds and Twisted America, \u2018Welcome to the Universe\u2019. This innovative CD, recorded live from Club Universe, reflects San Francisco\u2019s unique \u2018sound\u2019 and introduced the world to David Harness. Recognizing his talent, Twisted America quickly signed him to produce his first single, \u2018Get It Together\u2019, for a Twisted America compilation entitled \u2018A Little Bit of the Old, A Lot of the New\u2019.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "581 5th St, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Ghenji", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8874909.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.278385, 37.799161], "Date": "Wed Nov 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-27", "Genre": "Genres: House, Deep House, Tech House, Minimal, Minimal Techno, Deep Tech", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "BRIX 581", "moreBioInfo": "DJ/Producer Oakland, California USA", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Mophono", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Wed Nov 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-27", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "AMEN!

Just as Miles Davis broke down musical boundaries, Keyon uses his prodigious jazz chops to blow down all musical genre barriers. He has been featured on over 100 albums ranging from jazz, R&B, hip-hop, gospel and blues. He has toured and recorded with some of the world\u2019s best artists, including Jay-Z, Mac Miller, Beyonce, Robert Glasper, Prince, Common, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, Mary J Blige, Rihanna, Gregory Porter, Andre Crouch, D\u2019Angelo, 50 Cent and LL Cool J to name a few.

He\u2019s not simply a musician, but also a magician: A \u201cmugician\u201d, a notion evoked by director Don Cheadle when describing the trumpeter\u2019s spellbinding performance style. Keyon\u2019s latest studio album, \u201cThe Mugician\u201d, inspired by the Ferguson events, examines our troubled times through a far wider lens than any one tragedy. Sweeping and cinematic, the music draws on and obliterates the boundaries between jazz, classical, hip-hop, rock and blues to create something uniquely modern, unmistakably American, and triumphantly cohesive \u2014 thanks to Harrold\u2019s virtuosic skill as a trumpeter and songwriter, and his relentless optimistic belief in brighter days to come.\nTICKETS\n\nPARTIAL VIEW/BAR SEATING\nThis ticket is for table or bar seats with a partial stage view \u2013 You may arrive up to one hour early.

As founder, guitarist, and main composer Dave Ricketts says, the band is \u201cin love with the music of Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller and Jimmie Rodgers, as well as the stories, the life styles and the foot steps of hundreds of other great jazz, blues, country and rock musicians that created the sound of American Music from roughly 1900-1950\u2019s\u201d\n\nLed by eminent guitarist, Dave Ricketts, the group has been a San Francisco mainstay for over fifteen years, and one of the busiest bands in the bay area playing 5 to 10 gigs a week.

You are either a fan...or you haven't heard them yet. For over three decades, this unique vocal/guitar jazz duo has cast its passionate musical spell worldwide, capturing the hearts of lovers, the respect of jazz buffs, and the jaw-dropping awe of guitarists. With 35 years of performing together, and 32 years of marriage, the devotion forged by this extraordinary couple shows no sign of dimming from the pressure of familiarity. For them, this pressure creates more diamond than dust. Their instinct for refining their music, their technique and their career\u2014their home studio makeover\u2014their house and garden renovation\u2014never wavers from their credo: It\u2019s not done if it\u2019s not from the heart. And what comes from the heart demands excellence. Onstage and off, guitarist Tuck Andress and vocalist/arranger Patti Cathcart might, at first impression, strike you as an odd couple. The obvious difference in skin color is quickly overshadowed by the contrast of their personalities. Patti exudes the soft, centered yet powerful graciousness of a gospel singer; Tuck almost wears his brain on his skin, anticipating the thousands of musical decisions he\u2019ll have to send to his ten fingers during the course of a performance. Seeing the virtuosity and complexity of Tuck's guitar work, most are surprised to learn that Patti is the actual writer, arranger, and producer. Without even blinking, Tuck-the-problem-solver brags, \u201cPatti writes and arranges; I am just the orchestra.\u201d Beneath these layers, however, one hits shared bedrock, from the depth and extent of their musical training to their get-the-job-done focus to their absolute bond of partnership. Their time apart feeds their moments together. \u201cWhen we're not actually recording an album,\u201d says Patti, \u201cI am singing notes into my little recorder to give to Tuck once we get started.\u201d Meanwhile, Tuck might update their database and website. For I Remember You, Tuck worked out parts drawn from a Count Basie recording, then painstakingly figured a way to play all the parts on his guitar. \u201cWe might not even use any of it,\u201d says Tuck, \u201cYou can't do it all at once, just on one guitar. But as a way to explore it, I would try to do it all at once. We hope we are suggesting it somehow.\u201d But Tuck points out that it would be a mistake to too narrowly cast himself as the virtuoso and Patti as the expressive heart and motivator of the duo. \u201cFlying fingers don't impress me much anymore. I'm much more interested in what I call \u2018soft virtuosity,\u2019 where the technique is usually invisible. It\u2019s micro-technique, where the subtleties are controlled, and that\u2019s where the heart of the music lies. Singers hopefully don't have visibly flying anything, so it\u2019s all about \u2018soft virtuosity.\u2019 \u201cSometimes we have to record take after take to get the guitar the way we want it. But when I listen to Patti in each of those versions, I just hear variations on mastery. If I didn't know how much virtuosity, how much discipline and control that requires, I\u2019d just say it sounds effortless and natural and never question it. She caresses and crafts each note as if it were the only note, yet each take somehow tells a different story\u2014I know she didn\u2019t practice all those details, so she\u2019s doing it on the fly. It takes massive technique to make a human body maintain perfect control of intonation, vibrato, dynamics, attack, breathing and all the other details that go into singing excellently, not to mention with heart-rending expression. I'm glad I don\u2019t have to try to do it; at least I can see if I\u2019m at the right fret!\u201d Both Tuck and Patti were fortunate enough to be part of musical families where records of all types were spinning on the turntable. Tuck\u2019s father had been a leader of a jazz band in college, and his older sister inspired him with her studies of classical piano. \u201cLittle did I know that I was getting tremendous ear training that would serve me for a lifetime.\u201d Tuck also took piano lessons, as well as latching on to her love of pop music. Patti seemed to be born singing. \"As a little girl,\" she recalls, \"instead of talking, I'd sing a running, stream-of-consciousness commentary on life. Many people in my family sang; I started singing in church, was leading youth choirs at age 10, and directing the adult choirs before I was 16.\u201d Patti also studied classical violin for 11 years, and in school was involved with school choirs, musicals, and various bands. She performed with many rock and jazz groups during the historic San Francisco sixties musical scene, and saw countless key performances by rock, blues, gospel and jazz greats of the day. \u201cThat was one of the wonderful things about growing up in the Bay Area,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI not only listened to and learned from, but got to see live a veritable who\u2019s who of every style of music: Tennessee Ernie Ford. Leonard Bernstein. Josephine Baker. The Beatles. Leontyne Price. Howling Wolf. Ella Fitzgerald. Sun Ra. Aretha Franklin jamming with Ray Charles and Billy Preston. Roland Kirk. The list goes on and on. It was an unbelievable education. \u201cThe Fillmore, Avalon Ballroom, Carousel Ballroom, Keystone Korner and Winterland were like home to me,\u201d she continues. \u201cBill Graham always looked out for me. Jimi Hendrix called me \u2018Foxy Lady\u2019 on my birthday one year. I jammed with hundreds of musicians!\u201d While Patti was pretty \u201cout there\u201d from the beginning, a shy boy in Tulsa, inspired by hearing The Beatles and Rolling Stones, spent days his room, \u201cruthlessly and systematically\u201d learning everything he could about guitar playing, including working his way through all 400 of the orchestral chords, complex jazz chords in the appendix of the Mel Bay chord book. Tuck studied briefly with the Atkins-inspired guitarist Tommy Crook, but most of his learning was on his own. He played with garage rock bands and school big bands, and painstakingly learned songs from records (such as Wes Montgomery, George Benson, John Coltrane, Art Tatum, Red Garland, Thelonius Monk \u201cand a host of piano players,\u201d not to mention blues, rock, R&B and country guitarists like B. B. King, Amos Garrett, Cornell Dupree, Eric Gale and Odell Stokes). Most important, Tuck progressed through \u201ca great deal of practice and experimentation. From an early point the guitar and I were inseparable. I would conduct my life with a guitar strapped on and my fingers active.\u201d Tuck, too, was influenced by Jimi Hendrix, but the rocker\u2019s sonic textures were so explosive, that Hendrix actually drove Tuck deeper into jazz. It was two years before he felt confident enough to figure out Hendrix\u2019s songs and style. The sixties scene brought Tuck to the West Coast, and in 1970, he enrolled as a music major at Stanford University. During breaks he tried out the LA studio scene. He was given the opportunity to be guitarist for the Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, but decided to reject this commercial detour. Later he spent four years with the GAP Band, his \u201cgraduate degree in soul music.\u201d Meanwhile he doggedly continued studying recordings of guitarists of every style, developing a knack for playing the guitar as several instruments at once. \u201cI learned how to vary the volume and tone of each part independently of the others,\u201d Tuck expains, \u201cnot knowing that this would become an essential ingredient of the fingerstyle guitar I would take up when Patti and I got together.\u201d For years, Tuck and Patti played in various Bay Area bands without meeting. Tuck, introspective and unambitious, contrasted with Patti\u2019s persona of bandleader, one who would and did jam with every hot musician in the area. In 1978, Tuck was already guitarist for a cover band when Patti walked in to audition. \u201cWithin a few seconds of hearing her sing,\u201d recalls Tuck, \u201cI knew I had found my lifetime musical partner.\u201d \u201dIt was that immediate for me too,\u201d says Patti. \u201cI immediately knew that the band \u2018wasn't happening,\u2019 but that I was going to steal the guy playing guitar in the corner!\u201d The two both explain that musicians always have this radar going, sweeping for their musical soulmate, that special someone that they can communicate and collaborate with. They stayed with the band for a few months, but really got to know each other as they shared a ride to rehearsals. They became best friends. They plotted another course. Jammed with other musicians. They realized they both had such extensive musical backgrounds that they knew hundreds of songs in common. They formed a duo, guitar and vocalist. Though Joe Pass and Ella Fitzgerald were an inspiration and model, landing live gigs with this sparse instrumentation took a little persuasion. Once booked, however, the rooms quickly filled with repeat fans. \u2018We had never had so much fun, nor been so challenged,\u201d says Tuck. \u201cWe went to play at a venue and forgot to take breaks.\u201d For this duo, from then on, there has not been a break. Friendship and collaboration grew to love, and the two were married in 1981. Their recording career took off when Windham Hill Jazz signed them for 1988\u2019s groundbreaking Tears of Joy. This and several other Windham Hill albums put them on the map, and they\u2019ve been solidifying their career, their musical conversation, their technique, and their love together ever since. Tuck and Patti now have their own recording studio, as well as their own record label, T&P Records, which licenses their CDs to major labels for distribution around the world. They tour Asia and Europe so much that they know that home is with each other, regardless of location. They are looking forward to, at long last, taking occasional time off from touring to teach at their Bay Area home, as well as doing workshops while on tour. A concert DVD, Tuck & Patti Live in Holland, with a behind-the-scenes documentary, As We Travel Round this Circle, was released in 2005. Their new album, I Remember You, will be released to all retail and digital retail outlets, including iTunes, on August 26, 2008. What's on the album? Love songs of course, from the Great American Songbook, inspired by Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Pass. \u201cThey are gorgeous tunes, with grand lyrics,\u201d shares Patti. \u201cAnd they sing unabashedly, unapologetically, about love.\u201d \u201dTo have every song feel like it\u2019s a dream to play,\u201d says Tuck. \u201cIt doesn't happen for every performer, but for us, it happens.\u201d Smiling, Patti adds, \u201cYou know, I think this conversation is going to last a lifetime.\u201d Written by Carol Wright The OFFICIAL T&P Facebook Fanpage http://www.tuckandpatti.com http://youtube.com/tuckandpatti http://twitter.com/tuckandpatti", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "230 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Wonder Bread 5", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8653487.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.822691, 38.40115], "Date": "Fri Nov 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "HopMonk Tavern Sebastopol", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Wonderbread-5"}, {"Address": "91 S Autumn St, San Jose, CA 95110", "Artist": "Lindsay Beaver", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8822310.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.900379, 37.329579], "Date": "Fri Nov 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-29", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Rockn Roll", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Poor House Bistro", "moreBioInfo": "When blues-rocking, soul-singing drummer, songwriter and bandleader Lindsay Beaver takes the stage, she makes an immediate and unforgettable impression. Standing front and center at her kit, singing every song from the depths of her soul, she delivers blues, R&B and old school rock \u2018n\u2019 roll with punk rock energy, and sings with a voice brimming with attitude and soulfulness. She comes at every song with urgent intensity, soul-baring emotion, a distinct swagger and a take-no-prisoners confidence. With influences ranging from Little Richard to The Ramones, from Billie Holiday to Queens of the Stone Age, Lindsay has crafted a timeless sound and personal style that simply cannot be denied.\n\nHailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and now a resident of Austin, Texas, Beaver possesses an old soul at the young age of 33. She is a classically trained vocalist and a jazz-trained drummer with a deep love and knowledge of roots music, from blues to jazz to R&B ballads to raucous rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Live and on her recordings, she lays it all on the line, performing her signature mix of unforgettable originals and dance floor-filling versions of songs by artists as diverse as Sam Cooke and The Detroit Cobras. Her Alligator Records debut, Tough As Love, introduces her as a true force of nature with a sky\u2019s-the-limit future.\n\nTough As Love, produced by Beaver, was recorded in Lindsay\u2019s current hometown of Austin, Texas. She wrote seven of the album\u2019s twelve tracks, the striking originals melding seamlessly with the perfectly-chosen covers. Her deep understanding of blues and roots rock traditions is a launching pad for her songs, combining electric urgency with skill and finesse. Tough As Love honors some of Beaver\u2019s inspirations (including songs by Little Willie John, Angela Strehli and Art Neville) while introducing her own instantly memorable songs. Along with her touring band\u2014guitarist Brad Stivers and bassist Josh Williams (\u201cthey are the glue that holds it all together,\u201d she says)\u2014well-known friends including Marcia Ball, Dennis Gruenling, Laura Chavez, Eve Monsees and Sax Gordon all add their talents to the proceedings. According to Beaver, \u201cThese are all folks that I\u2019ve admired or wanted to perform with for years. It was important for me to highlight people that have inspired me.\u201d From the first song to the last, Tough As Love is rough and raw, fearless and moving.\n\n\u201cSigning with Alligator is a true stamp of approval for any roots music artist,\u201d says Beaver, who has been releasing her own recordings and performing professionally for 15 years, first as a singer and then as a band-leading vocalist and drummer. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true.\u201d\n\nAlligator Records president Bruce Iglauer is thrilled to bring her into the fold. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to welcome Lindsay Beaver to the Alligator Records family. She\u2019s a great young talent. Her songs evoke the spirit of 1950s and \u201860s R&B and blues, but her singing and playing infuse them with a raw, rocking punk energy. Her music is full of unvarnished emotion and power.\u201d\n\nBeaver grew up in a working class family surrounded by music. She loved to sing around the house (especially soul music), but she was a shy kid and only sang when she was alone. She discovered the music of Tupac Shakur at age 11 and fell in love with hip hop, which started her on a path back to soul, blues and jazz. At 14 she heard Jimi Hendrix and then, in her words, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d She got a guitar and learned to play. She was finally convinced by her friends to sing in public in her high school talent show. From there, she sang in school musicals and at open mic events around Halifax. But when she first heard Billie Holiday sing Don\u2019t Explain at age 17, Lindsay found her true musical direction. \u201cI was floored,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHer voice had more soul and emotional depth than any singer I had ever heard. Billie led me to lots of other jazz, and jazz led me to blues.\u201d\n\nImmediately after graduating high school, Lindsay took voice lessons and began a self-described \u201ccrash course\u201d in classical music. A quick study with obvious talent, she received a scholarship to train as a classical soprano. Around the same time, she put together a small jazz band featuring her vocals. \u201cMy drummer didn\u2019t want to keep bringing his drums over to my house for rehearsal,\u201d she recalls. So my dad scraped together enough money to buy a drum set to keep in the house. As soon as I sat down at that set, I got it.\u201d Her biggest drumming inspiration is the immortal Earl Palmer, who recorded with everyone from Little Richard and Fats Domino to Frank Sinatra, the Beach Boys, Dizzy Gillespie and Tom Waits. \u201cHe was the perfect drummer,\u201d she says. \u201cHe understood how to play for the song.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 19, Beaver saw Canadian blues icons The Garrett Mason Trio perform. Between the hordes of happy, dancing fans and the band\u2019s fiery-hot performance, Beaver came to a realization then and there. \u201cI want to do that,\u201d she decided. \u201cHave a band, actually be a real musician.\u201d Later that week she went to the local Sunday night blues jam. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell any of the blues guys about my singing. I figured that if I told them that I sang, nobody would take me seriously as a drummer. So I did my jazz gigs in town singing and then would go to the blues jam on Sunday as a drummer.\"\n\nWanting to broaden her horizons, Beaver headed to Toronto to study jazz drumming, with the desire to take her percussion skills to a whole new level. \u201cI got in,\u201d she recalls, \u201cbecause I was the only applicant who could play a shuffle.\u201d She started a blues and soul group\u2014the acclaimed 24th Street Wailers\u2014and began making a name for herself in Toronto and across Canada. She befriended guitarist Jimmie Vaughan, who recognized her talent instantly. She started making regular pilgrimages to Austin to jam with locals beginning in 2014. When she relocated to Austin permanently in 2018, she formed a new band featuring her own soulful vocals and dynamic drumming and the talents of fiery guitarist Brad Stivers and rock-solid bassist Josh Williams.\n\nOver the course of her career, Beaver self-released five albums by her band, the 24th Street Wailers, producing three of them. Tough As Love is her first release under her own name. She has toured Canada, the United States and large swaths of Europe, and will be back on the road bringing her new music to places far and wide, earning new fans at every stop. \u201cI like music with drive and passion,\u201d she says. \u201cI write what I know and I sing what I know. At my shows, I want people to have fun and to be moved. I want everyone to be inspired to dance and I want at least some people to be moved to tears. And I definitely want every person to go home saying, \u2018I\u2019m never going to forget this.\u2019\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2400 First St, Livermore, CA 94550", "Artist": "So You Think You Can Dance", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9514332.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.768321, 37.683395], "Date": "Fri Nov 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Livermore Valley Performing Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "101 6th st, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Jeno", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Fri Nov 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Marble x Monarch: Jay Tripwire, Jeno, PabloDiscobar"}, {"Address": "998 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Matt Jaffe", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8945081.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421431, 37.75704], "Date": "Fri Nov 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-29", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Indie Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Amado's", "moreBioInfo": "Matt Jaffe is a 24 year old rock & roll singer/songwriter from San Francisco.

After captivating the crowds at Woodford Folk Festival, Caloundra Music Festival and Island Vibe Festival and touring the east and west coasts of Australia the band has gained a reputation as a powerful force in the live music scene. Their sets are well known for being relentlessly high energy and commanding the attention of the audience with a unique sound that is a concoction of African rhythms, psychedelic funk and improvisational fusion, described as \u2018afro/psych\u2019.\n\nThe band is built around Hayden Hack, a talented singer/songwriter who was raised in South Africa and the UK by professional musician parents. Hayden, who settled in Maleny after immigrating to Australia 12 years ago, grew up around touring artists and has himself recently returned from a solo tour in his homeland of South Africa. Completing the HighLife rhythm section is Nathaniel Combs, a percussion teacher who has just returned from studying in West Africa, well known jazz drummer Max Sportelli, Brad Wenham on 6 string bass and Paddy Kiernan on electric guitar.\n\nRecently Highlife was joined on tour by virtuoso West African musician Bassidi Kon\u00e9, a master of the djembe and the traditional Malian instrument the Balafon. While touring together, the band invited Bassidi to collaborate on some of their tracks. \u2018Working with Bassidi in the studio was a master class in musicianship\u2019 says guitarist Paddy Kiernan, \u2018his incredible rhythmic and melodic sensibility just added a whole new depth to our songs, we were very lucky to have the opportunity to work with him.\u2019 The first single to be released, \u2018Sing My Soul\u2019 featuring Bassidi Kon\u00e9 on Balafon, was recorded by the band at Sunny Coast Music in Caloundra and mixed at Yama Nui studio by Paulie B, an Aria winning producer well known for his work with George, The Beautiful Girls and Bobby Alu among many others.

Named one of Comedy Central's \"100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time,\" Breuer is one of the most recognizable comedians in the business, known for his charismatic stage antics, dead-on impressions, and family-friendly stand-up. In addition to keeping busy on his current comedy tour The Family Warrior, Breuer can be heard on his weekly podcast \u201cThe Metal In Me\u201d which is available for download on BlogTalkRadio and airs Thursdays 7pm-8pm on Opie Radio Sirius/XM.\n\nEven as a young student at Valley Stream Central High School in Long Island, NY, Breuer knew he wanted to be a stand-up comedian. After spending several years working comedy clubs across the country, Breuer settled in as a regular on the New York comedy club circuit. After being in New York for only seven months, Breuer landed a gig on the nationally syndicated show, \u201cUptown Comedy Club,\u201d where he spent two seasons. Later he appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cHome Improvement\u201d starring funny man Tim Allen, before making his big break which came in 1995 when he joined the cast of NBC\u2019s legendary \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d During his four years on SNL, Breuer quickly became a fan-favorite for his original character \u201cGoat Boy\u201d and his dead-on impressions of actor Joe Pesci.\n\nFollowing his success on SNL, Breuer starred alongside Dave Chappelle in the cult favorite film \u201cHalf Baked.\u201d He has since appeared in the popular films \u201cZookeeper,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d \u201cTitan A.E.\u201d and \u201cBeer League.\u201d On the small screen, Breuer hosted MTV's popular \u201cBeach House\u201d and VH1\u2019s \u201cWeb Junk 20.\u201d His other television appearances include \u201cKevin Can Wait,\u201d \u201cThis Is Not Happening,\u201d \u201cLate Night with Conan O\u2019Brien,\u201d \u201cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\u201d \u201cThe Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,\u201d \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d \u201cLate Night with Jimmy Fallon,\u201d and \u201cThe Marriage Ref.\u201d Breuer is also a frequent guest on the Howard Stern Show.\n\nIn 2008, Breuer set out for his \"Breuniversity Tour\" with his 85-year-old father and a film crew. The footage that was captured blended together to create \u201cThe Jim Breuer Road Journals,\" which showcased what life is like on the road with a comedian and his father. Videos from that tour also sparked the making of his documentary \u201cMore Than Me,\u201d which was shown at the 2009 Montreal Film Festival. In July of 2009, Breuer\u2019s one-hour Comedy Central special \u201cLet's Clear the Air\u201d premiered with hilarious topics that included what \"success\" really is, his SNL days and life with his elderly parents, his wife and his three daughters. In 2011, Breuer embarked on a national tour with three of the country\u2019s top comedians, Dave Attell, Bill Burr, and Jim Norton, for \"The Anti-Social Network\" tour. That same year, Breuer's acclaimed autobiography, \u201cI\u2019m Not High: (But I've Got a Lot of Crazy Stories about Life as a Goat Boy, a Dad, and a Spiritual Warrior),\u201d was released on paperback. In the memoir, Breuer sheds light on his early struggles, his rise to fame and the many lessons he\u2019s learned along in an extremely funny, yet personal and touching way that fans have never seen before. In 2015, Breuer released his all new one hour comedy special on EPIX, \u201cJim Breuer: Comic Frenzy.\u201d The latest special focuses on what Breuer\u2019s life (and all of our lives) truly consist of: dealing with the elderly, becoming our parents\u2019 caretakers, parenting teenagers, and what it takes to be a \u201cmarriage warrior.\u201d Breuer recently released his debut Metal album \u201cSongs From The Garage\u201d on May 27 with his new band \u201cJim Breuer and The Loud & Rowdy\u201d through Metal Blade Records.\n\nThroughout the years, Breuer has supported various charities through his comedy, including the Chris Farley Foundation, MusiCares, his local police and fire departments and more. Breuer currently resides in New Jersey where he enjoys spending time with his family, playing pick-up games of baseball, softball and wiffle ball and watching the NY Mets.", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // Ages 21+ // GA Floor Seated $28 // Balcony Seated $33 // Gold Circle Seated $38 // VIP Meet & Greet $130"}, {"Address": "1460 First St., Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Sam Johnson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9124994.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.289852, 38.297276], "Date": "Fri Nov 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-29", "Genre": "Genres: The California Sound, Pop, Rock, Reggae", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "JaM Cellars", "moreBioInfo": "Sam Johnson\u2019s love for music goes back to his adolescent years, when he learned Bob Marley and Sublime songs on hand me down instruments, and started a reggae band at his high school in Huntington Beach, California. This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Having used numerous aliases, his music caught the ear of legends like Laurent Garnier at the first place, as well as Depeche Mode which ended using one of his tracks as pre-show track during their Delta Machine Tour between 2012 and 2013.\n\n\n\nBeing 14 at that time and having given up his first alias for a second one, he been able to release a remix for Moguai on deadmau5\u2019s label mau5trap, as well as continuing of improving his sound though multiple releases.\n\n\n\nBut early 2012 suddenly saw the birth of a new kid on the block, someone nobody saw coming - Matt Fax. A new kid that been making a name of himself very quickly since his first EP \u00ab Invisible / Deadline \u00bb, thanks to his unique signature of Progressive, Trance and Techno that caught the ear of numerous music lovers, labels and DJs. While releasing a huge number of tracks on small independent labels, Matt started gaining support from recognized DJ\u2019s like Above & Beyond and Jaytech among others.\n\n\n\nMatt then shown himself very productive in 2013. Releasing his debut EP \u00ab Late Night/Broadway \u00bb on Enhanced Music sub-label Colorize, the title track had the Record of the Week spot on Above & Beyond\u2019s radio show Group Therapy and Matt quickly been one of the most played artist on the show, as stated by the trio. As a result of that, he made his debut on Anjunabeats, and been invited on Group Therapy for a guest mix, as well as hosting a couple episodes of Anjunabeats Worldwide.\n\n\n\nKeeping on releasing a constant number of music throughout the year, his 2014 single \u00ab Shift \u00bb particularly received a huge wave of supports from top Trance DJs around the world, but also from renowned magazines such as DJ Mag, which described the track as \u00ab One of the year\u2019s best big room Trance records \u00bb.\n\n\n\nAfter a 6 month break, Matt came back to the scene in 2015 with the now classic \u00ab Going Down/Hyperspace \u00bb EP. Not only the fact the EP reached #10 on the Beatport Releases Top 100, but it also been highly supported on almost every show throughout the year. It also found a place in a couple of festivals such as the A State of Trance Festival in Mumbai, where Armin van Buuren played the title track in front of millions of music lovers. Armin been since then very supportive of Matt\u2019s work, from premiering his Zerothree debut \u00ab Supertaper \u00bb on his radio show, to giving him the opportunity to release a couple of singles and EPs on Armada Music\u2019s sub-label Statement!. Later singles like \u00ab Tumble \u00bb, \u00ab Moonlight \u00bb, \u00ab Alpenglow \u00bb, \u00ab Aeris \u00bb (in collaboration with Jaytech) or \u00ab Astral Ride \u00bb and EPs like \u00ab Belong / Mirth \u00bb or \u00ab CNFS / Stuck \u00bb been heard in various radio shows and radio stations such as Sirius XM.\n\n\n\nThis year saw Matt step up his game with singles like \u00ab Warmrider \u00bb and \u00ab Vina \u00bb, as well as the great \u00ab Wrath \u00bb EP, but he showed back on Anjunabeats with an incredible remix for Boom Jinx and Aruna\u2019s single \u00ab Light as a Feather \u00bb, which been critically acclaimed and led into a new Group Therapy guest mix, where Matt showcased his abilities for shifting genres.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Poor Man's Whiskey", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7881560.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Fri Nov 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-29", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Acoustic, Indie, Alternative Country, Americana, Country, Folk, High Octane Hootenanny", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "\"In the end, they are an original distillation, a tasty burn that goes down with a kick and lingers beautifully when it hits your gut.\"- Dennis Cook, Jambase.com Poor Man's Whiskey plays \"High Octane Hootenanny\" music\u2026Dance, laugh, sing.

They have performed at Sat Nam Fest, Bhakti Fest, the Kripalu Center, and hundreds of yoga studios and wellness centers throughout North America. They have trained many budding sound therapists on the therapeutic aspects of the Gong. Over the past 20+ years Mike Tamburo has become well known as a multi-instrumentalist and polymath, performing and recording ecstatic and transcendental music as well as folk, ambient and sometimes unclassifiable sounds. He is also an artist and a film maker. As he worked deeper and deeper with the sound current and his own self healing practices, he discovered the healing power of the gong and other tuned metal instruments (singing bowls, bells, sound plates) as well as the healing power of mantra and toning. In 2008 he met Gallina Tamburo, who was on her own journey of healing. Their shared love of ecstatic music, kundalini yoga, the gong, sound therapy, and sacred chanting set the foundation of their relationship, marriage and eventual musical collaboration. In addition to completing their Kundalini Teacher Training at the mother ashram in Espanola, NM and Yoga For Youth Training with Krishna Kaur they have studied with Gongmasters Don Conreaux and Sotantar. They are also trained in the Peter Hess Method of Sound Massage using Himalayan Singing Bowls for healing. They have also studied with John Beaulieu in his Body Harmonics approach of sound healing with tuning forks.\nThe duo have released 6 CDs together and also run the Sounds Eternal record label that has released many of Mike\u2019s solo recordings. Together, Mike and Gallina have developed their own style of relating to the therapeutic vibrations of the Gong, incorporating ancient wisdom and infusing it with creativity, playfulness and joy. Crown of Eternity offer a unique sonic experience that is as much grounded in tradition as it is groundbreaking. There is an expansive, blissful, ethereal and epic quality to Crown of Eternity\u2019s music. They are truly immersed in vibration.

His concerts and workshops are heart centered, uplifting, sonically multi-dimensional, life affirming experiences that focus on self transformation through conscious listening and breathing. He lives in deep gratitude and joy that his life of music has had meaning and been of use to the world around him. He seeks peace and harmony in his life and hopes to share this peace with others through his music and teachings.\nThrough extensive national tours both solo and with Crown of Eternity, Mike has offered countless workshops, classes, therapy sessions, concerts and retreats and has guided thousands of people to listen deeply, relax, reconnect to themselves and most importantly marvel at the power of sound.\nOver the past 20+ years Mike Tamburo has become well known as a multi-instrumentalist, music educator, interdisciplinary sound artist, video artist, sound therapist, writer, meditation teacher and avid traveler; sharing over 1800 public and private performances and recording more than 65 albums of ecstatic and transcendental music as well as folk, drone, ambient and sometimes unclassifiable sounds. Early in Tamburo's career he gained notoriety for his string playing (hammered dulcimer, guitar and shahi baaja). In many of his early performances he began to enter into altered states of consciousness and have out of body experiences while performing. In order to understand these experiences he went into years of self study; exploring Kundalini Yoga, energy work, the therapeutic use of sound and how sound effects consciousness, human perception and self healing. His love for long sustained drones, overtones and psychoacoustics led him to working with multiple gongs and other tuned metal instruments (bells, sound plates, singing bowls) as well as exploring the healing power of mantra and toning.

Five decades in the making; it is equal parts thriller, romance, suspense and horror. There are musical fireworks, critical acclaim and fists-aloft triumph, offset by wilderness years and brushes with the jaws of narcotic oblivion. There are feted early stints as gunslinger in bands from John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers to Canned Heat, and the solo career that\u2019s still blazing a quarter-century later. The veteran bluesman has seen and done it all, with just one omission: he\u2019s never made a covers album, until now. \u201cLuther Allison\u2019s Blues is my first,\u201d Trout notes. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about doing this album for years. It was just time.\u201d Of all the peaks in Trout\u2019s trajectory, his abiding memory of the late Chicago bluesman is perhaps the most literal. It\u2019s 1986, and high above Lake Geneva, at the palatial Alpine chalet of late Montreux Jazz Festival Svengali Claude Nobs, lunch is being served. \u201cSo we\u2019re up at the top of the Alps,\u201d Trout recalls, \u201cin this big room with John Mayall, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Robert Cray, Otis Rush, and as we\u2019re eating, Dr. John is serenading us on acoustic piano. I was sat there with Luther Allison, and we had a great talk. \u201cLuther was one of the all-time greats,\u201d Trout continues, \u201cand it was just an unbelievably potent thing to watch him perform. Just the energy and commitment that guy had, he was one of a kind. We played together once, at the Jazz Fest that year, and just as we walked offstage, somebody pointed a camera and we hugged and smiled. And that photo is on the cover of the CD.\u201dWhen he died [in 1997], the idea of this album was planted in my brain. Released June 10, 2013 on Provogue Records, this latest collection was bottled at Hollywood\u2019s Entourage Studios alongside producer Eric Corne: the same combination that birthed 2012\u2019s acclaimed solo release, Blues For The Modern Daze. The atmosphere, remembers Trout, was one of spit, grit and seat-of-the-pants energy: \u201cSpontaneity is so important with this sort of music. Everybody was saying, \u2018Well, aren\u2019t you gonna get together and rehearse?\u2019, but you don\u2019t want to over-analyse or get too sterile. This album was all pretty much first or second takes. It\u2019s gotta have warts on it. It\u2019s gotta have a bit of grease in it.\u201d None of which should imply Luther Allison\u2019s Blues was a throwaway project. \u201cAt times, it was, like, have I taken on too much here?\u201d admits Trout. \u201cLike, am I actually capable of doing justice to this? To me, Cherry Red Wine is one of the all-time greatest blues songs ever written, and Luther\u2019s original version is so unbelievably passionate and emotional that even to sing it was a daunting task. If I had my way with this album, it would reignite interest in the man and his work, make people go back and check out the originals.\u201d Trout knows all about the life-shaping power of a great record. Rewind to the mid-Sixties, and he was put on his path by an older brother with a habit of blasting the family home in New Jersey with seminal blues-rock platters from Paul Butterfield\u2019s 1965 debut to John Mayall\u2019s seismic Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton. \u201cHe brought home John Mayall, and told me, \u2018You gotta hear this guy!\u2019\u201d reflects the 62-year-old guitarist, who was soon inspired to buy his first Gibson Les Paul while on a day trip to Philadelphia. \u201cI have fond memories of all those records. I still listen to them.\u201d Local bands never got the breaks, and in 1973, Trout made the death-or-glory move to LA, where he slept on couches and scrabbled for work. \u201cI came out here and it was a overwhelming thing,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t know anybody. I just started going around to clubs where there were bands playing and asked if I could sit in. My first gig, I was stand-up lead singer in a country band, singing Merle Haggard tunes. And with my third paycheque, I went and bought that Strat that\u2019s still on the cover of all my CDs.\u201d In a city of Hicksville hopefuls, Trout\u2019s ferocious talent on lead guitar and gift-of-the-gab soon marked him out. \u201cI went to a party and that\u2019s where I met Jesse Ed Davis, who was the first really famous guy I played with,\u201d he remembers, of the sideman era that also saw him work alongside Big Mama Thornton, Lowell Fulson and Joe Tex. \u201cI just weasled my way into his band, and I was with Jessie for two years. By 1981, Trout had switched to West Coast boogie-blues titans Canned Heat for a period he diplomatically recalls as \u201cturbulent\u201d, but even this gig was topped three years later by a fantastical phone call from John Mayall, dangling the revered guitar slot in his iconic Bluesbreakers outfit. \u201cAs far as being a blues-guitar sideman, that gig is the pinnacle,\u201d states Trout. \u201cThat\u2019s Mount Everest. You could play with B.B. King or Buddy Guy, but you\u2019re just gonna play chords all night. This guy features you. You get to play solos. He yells your name after every song, brings you to the front of the stage, and lets you sing. He creates a place for you in the world. Where do you go from there\u2026?\u201d Trout would answer that question in emphatic style on March 6, 1989. As guitarist, his tenure had brought thrilling flammability to the Breakers\u2019 sound and produced stone-cold classics including One Life To Live, but as the newly sober guitarist played a lavish show at a Gothenburg symphony hall on his 38th birthday, he sensed the hand of destiny. \u201cTo walk away from the Bluesbreakers,\u201d he admits, \u201ca lot of people thought was completely crazy, because I could have stayed with John as long as I wanted. I mean, John to this day is like a dad to me. He was behind me when I was all screwed up, kept me in the band, believed in me, and gave me the opportunity to progress and grow up in a certain way. So that was a huge decision, and it was scary, but I had to do it, because I knew I had more, y\u2019know?\u201d Quarter of a century later, what seemed like career suicide has been vindicated by a thrilling catalogue of 22 solo albums, a still-growing army of fans and accolades including a nod as \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest rock guitarist\u201d in legendary DJ Bob Harris\u2019s autobiography The Whispering Years, and a #6 placing on BBC Radio One\u2019s countdown of the Top 20 Guitarists of All Time. Meanwhile, Trout\u2019s most recent original album, Blues For The Modern Daze, was heralded by titles like Classic Rock Blues as perhaps his finest to date. \u201cI feel like with Modern Daze,\u201d he nods, \u201cI found the style I\u2019ve been searching for over 20 albums. It\u2019s working, it comes out good, and I can play it well.\u201d A lesser artist might rest on such laurels. As Walter Trout powers into his 25th year as a solo star, there\u2019s no whiff of the ennui or creative autopilot that hobbles the later output of most veterans. On the contrary, there\u2019s a sense of growing momentum, perhaps even of a little surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe I\u2019m still alive, to be honest,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI should have been dead by 30, with the life I was leading. But I still have a career, and at 62, I\u2019m still climbing the ladder, which keeps it exciting, instead of trying to rekindle past glories. I feel like I play with more fire than when I was 25.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Formerly a hip-hop beat producer, known as J Beatz, in his native Massachusetts, Stell switched creative lanes following a life-altering trip to Big Sur, California. He adopted influences from the state\u2019s natural glory and open spaces to create the atmospheric and wide-spanning Big Wild sound, which today traverses electronic, indie, pop and beyond.\n\nSince officially launching in 2012, Big Wild has become one of the fastest-rising dance/electronic artists in recent years. He first broke out in April 2015 with the incendiary track \u201cAftergold\u201d (Foreign Family Collective), which topped the Spotify Global Viral Chart upon release. He followed the success of \u201cAftergold\u201d with his debut EP, Invincible, in February 2017 (Foreign Family Collective).\n\nAs the next progression, in February 2019 Big Wild will release his debut album, Superdream, on Counter Records. The new album sees Stell pushing the boundaries as a producer and artist like never before, as he serves as the primary lyricist, singer and songwriter for the first time ever. Each song is diverse in sound and scope and represents the full spectrum of emotions and experiences that are central to the essence of being: in one moment, you\u2019re dancing out of your seat, only to find yourself in joyful tears seconds later. The album title, thus, reflects this amalgamation: a super dream combining all of life\u2019s curious, inspiring occasions. The album\u2019s first two lead singles, \u201cJoypunks\u201d and \u201cMaker,\u201d are out now, with additional tracks to be released in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThe album was inspired by a need to create music that was a greater reflection of who I am now,\u201d Stell says of Superdream. \u201cThis led me to feature my voice and songwriting as the main focus for the first time ever. I wanted to create a personal record that people could relate to using my own life experiences. When I listen to Superdream, it feels more like me than any of my other music.\u201d\n\nAs a performer, Big Wild is one of the most progressive live acts on the electronic circuit today. His live show has him switching between multiple instruments (drum pads, synths, keyboards & live vocals) to deliver unique energetic performances every night. Coinciding with the release of Superdream, Big Wild will kick off a 17-date 2019 headlining tour across the US, which will bring the Superdream album experience to the stage via a brand-new live show.

Through their extensive international tours with workshops, trainings, therapy sessions, concerts and retreats they have helped thousands of people connect to their life energy, to deeper relaxation and to self healing. They have performed at Sat Nam Fest, Bhakti Fest, the Kripalu Center, and hundreds of yoga studios and wellness centers throughout North America. They have trained many budding sound therapists on the therapeutic aspects of the Gong. Over the past 20+ years Mike Tamburo has become well known as a multi-instrumentalist and polymath, performing and recording ecstatic and transcendental music as well as folk, ambient and sometimes unclassifiable sounds. He is also an artist and a film maker. As he worked deeper and deeper with the sound current and his own self healing practices, he discovered the healing power of the gong and other tuned metal instruments (singing bowls, bells, sound plates) as well as the healing power of mantra and toning. In 2008 he met Gallina Tamburo, who was on her own journey of healing. Their shared love of ecstatic music, kundalini yoga, the gong, sound therapy, and sacred chanting set the foundation of their relationship, marriage and eventual musical collaboration. In addition to completing their Kundalini Teacher Training at the mother ashram in Espanola, NM and Yoga For Youth Training with Krishna Kaur they have studied with Gongmasters Don Conreaux and Sotantar. They are also trained in the Peter Hess Method of Sound Massage using Himalayan Singing Bowls for healing. They have also studied with John Beaulieu in his Body Harmonics approach of sound healing with tuning forks.\nThe duo have released 6 CDs together and also run the Sounds Eternal record label that has released many of Mike\u2019s solo recordings. Together, Mike and Gallina have developed their own style of relating to the therapeutic vibrations of the Gong, incorporating ancient wisdom and infusing it with creativity, playfulness and joy. Crown of Eternity offer a unique sonic experience that is as much grounded in tradition as it is groundbreaking. There is an expansive, blissful, ethereal and epic quality to Crown of Eternity\u2019s music. They are truly immersed in vibration. Their CDs include Gong/Bell CDs: \u201cDream Architecture\u201d, \u201cEarth in Space\u201d and Mantra CDs: \u201cWhen the Music\u2019s On\u201d, \u201cVibrate the Cosmos\u201d and \u201cThe Cosmos Shall Clear The Path\u201d and Mike\u2019s newest hammered dulcimer release \u201cThe Way To Be Free\u2019. Whether they are bathing you in the complex harmonics of multiple gongs, ecstatic instrumentals or their cosmic renditions of sacred Kundalini Yoga mantras, Crown of Eternity delivers a heart centered experience that you will deeply appreciate and remember.\nLearn more: http://www.crownofeternity.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "San Francisco Symphony", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9514701.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419994, 37.777441], "Date": "Sat Nov 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-30", "Genre": "Genres: Classical, Instrumental, Other", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Davies Symphony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "If there\u2019s a Ghostbusters screening and you need someone to perform the score, who you gonna call?

Just as Miles Davis broke down musical boundaries, Keyon uses his prodigious jazz chops to blow down all musical genre barriers. He has been featured on over 100 albums ranging from jazz, R&B, hip-hop, gospel and blues. He has toured and recorded with some of the world\u2019s best artists, including Jay-Z, Mac Miller, Beyonce, Robert Glasper, Prince, Common, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, Mary J Blige, Rihanna, Gregory Porter, Andre Crouch, D\u2019Angelo, 50 Cent and LL Cool J to name a few.

He\u2019s not simply a musician, but also a magician: A \u201cmugician\u201d, a notion evoked by director Don Cheadle when describing the trumpeter\u2019s spellbinding performance style. Keyon\u2019s latest studio album, \u201cThe Mugician\u201d, inspired by the Ferguson events, examines our troubled times through a far wider lens than any one tragedy. Sweeping and cinematic, the music draws on and obliterates the boundaries between jazz, classical, hip-hop, rock and blues to create something uniquely modern, unmistakably American, and triumphantly cohesive \u2014 thanks to Harrold\u2019s virtuosic skill as a trumpeter and songwriter, and his relentless optimistic belief in brighter days to come.\nTICKETS\n\nPARTIAL VIEW/BAR SEATING\nThis ticket is for table or bar seats with a partial stage view \u2013 You may arrive up to one hour early.

Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a crazed looking clown walking in my direction. Wearing a costume of bright yellow and red, and giant shiny shoes, he seemingly fit into the surroundings, but it didn\u2019t take long to see that something wasn\u2019t quite right. His costume was trailed by long, tattered, hippie fringe that was dirty from scraping the floor (and most likely the alley behind the restaurant), and more alarmingly his face was caked in ghostly make up that looked like it had been smeared on with a putty knife. My first thought was that he looked like Skeletor as a member of Uriah Heap. Taking a seat in my booth, he informed me that his name was Ronald Osborne, and he that he was familiar with my oddity rock band Rosemary\u2019s Billygoat. He was a fan of the band, and said he had a concept I might appreciate, something he termed \u201cdrive-thru metal.\u201d Some of the delinquent kids who worked for the franchise had been allowing him and a cast of characters named Slayer Mac Cheeze, Grimalice, and the Cat Burglar, to perform secret rock shows in the bunker-like basements of the local restaurants. But the time had come, he said, to bring drive-thru metal up from the \u201cunderground,\u201d and he asked if I would consider becoming the manager of his band. I asked him what the act was called, and proclaimed with pride, \u201cMAC SABBATH!\u201d I barely had time to gather up what was left of my faux food before the restaurant\u2019s manager, apparently annoyed both by the disheveled clown and the content of our conversation, came over and forcefully assisted us out onto the street. As we hit the sidewalk, I looked over at Ronald, watched him brush the dust of cold fries, sodium chloride and GMO remnants of my UN happy meal from his grease-smeared clown suit, and couldn\u2019t help but think there was something special, perhaps even great, about the man. He invited me to one of these secret shows, and two nights later I was sitting in the basement of a fast food restaurant in the San Fernando Valley, my eyes and taste buds tingling to a new sensation. Drive-thru metal was real, and talk about a feast for the senses! Black Sabbath\u2019s music, hilarious fast food lyrics, smoldering clown heads with laser eyes, a giant purple gumdrop bass player, and Tony Iommi with a giant cheeseburger head. I was confused, amazed, and dare I say it, can\u2019t ever remember feeling so\u2026\u2026\u2026happy! I told Ronald that yes, I would love to manage his band. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy\u2014nothing ever is with a disturbed clown and a band of Monsanto mutants who refuse to reveal their identities because they think they came here from a wormhole in space time direct from 1970. But whoever they are and however they got here, they\u2019re here now and they\u2019re ready, so pull up to the window and check your order, because I am proud to present the world\u2019s newest concept in entertainment, the culinary disgrace that is MAC SABBATH!

En 1975 decidieron juntarse para tocar distintos temas de grupos a los que admiraban, entre ellos The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, The Police, entre otros. Inicialmente, se hac\u00edan llamar The Spies of the Green Hat, pero pronto el nombre se abrevi\u00f3 a Green Hat y, finalmente, se adapt\u00f3 al espa\u00f1ol como Sombrero Verde, ya que la banda deseaba tocar rock en su propio idioma, siendo de los primeros grupos en aventurarse a componer sus propias canciones aun cuando el rock en espa\u00f1ol no era una tendencia. En 1981 publicaron su primer disco, Sombrero Verde, con el sello Ariola; los sencillos fueron \"Vampiro\", \"Profesor\", \"Long time\" y \"Despi\u00e9rtate\". En 1983 lanzaron A Tiempo de Rock; los sencillos del \u00e1lbum ser\u00edan \"Laura\", \"Hechos nada m\u00e1s\" y \"Me voy al mar\". Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo logr\u00f3 escaso \u00e9xito. En 1984, Abraham Calleros, baterista del grupo, decide dejar la banda para continuar su carrera musical en Estados Unidos. El grupo decide poner un anuncio en el peri\u00f3dico solicitando un nuevo integrante, gracias a esto encuentran al joven baterista de origen cubano-colombiano nacido en Miami, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, quien a partir de ese momento ser\u00eda pieza clave de la historia del grupo. La vida de Sombrero Verde continu\u00f3 hasta 1986, cuando el guitarrista Gustavo Orozco decide tambi\u00e9n abandonar la agrupaci\u00f3n concentrarse en sus estudios acad\u00e9micos. Al quedar de nuevo el grupo como cuarteto, Fher decide cerrar el libro de Sombrero Verde y formar una nueva banda que fusionara el rock, pop y los ritmos latinos. En esa \u00e9poca, comenz\u00f3 en M\u00e9xico el movimiento denominado \"Rock en tu idioma\", una estrategia comercial de algunas compa\u00f1\u00edas discogr\u00e1ficas encaminada a llamar la atenci\u00f3n de los j\u00f3venes para desarrollar m\u00fasica rock en espa\u00f1ol. La tendencia, importada de Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, estaba avalada por el trabajo pionero de grupos como Soda Stereo, Enanitos Verdes, Mecano, Nacha Pop, La Uni\u00f3n, Radio Futura, Hombres G y Zas (La banda de Miguel Mateos); como consecuencia de ello, aparecieron varias bandas mexicanas formadas por j\u00f3venes con influencias musicales de grupos norteamericanos y europeos. Surgieron as\u00ed las bandas l\u00edderes del movimiento en M\u00e9xico: Caifanes, Maldita Vecindad, Caf\u00e9 Tacvba y, entre ellas, Man\u00e1, quienes lograr\u00edan \u00e9xito no solo a nivel local sino tambi\u00e9n internacionalmente. Man\u00e1 En medio de este naciente movimiento, la banda adopt\u00f3 el nombre que le dar\u00eda proyecci\u00f3n internacional: \u00abMan\u00e1\u00bb, que fue elegido por el significado que tiene la palabra en polinesio: \u00abenerg\u00eda positiva\u00bb. La alineaci\u00f3n qued\u00f3 conformada por Fher Olvera como vocalista, los hermanos Ulises y Ju\u00e1n Diego Calleros, en guitarra y bajo respectivamente, y Alex Gonz\u00e1lez en la bater\u00eda. En 1987, el grupo firm\u00f3 con la discogr\u00e1fica Polygram y public\u00f3 Man\u00e1, disco que afianzar\u00eda el movimiento Rock en tu idioma. De este trabajo se desprendieron los sencillos: \u201cRobot\u201d, \u201cMentirosa\u201d, \u201cMueve tus caderas\u201d y \u201cQueremos paz\u201d. Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo tuvo escaso \u00e9xito, y no dej\u00f3 del todo satisfechos a los integrantes; diversos roces con la disquera por el deseo de mantener la esencia e identidad del grupo, llevaron a Man\u00e1 a pedir su carta de retiro de Polygram. Falta Amor Con un futuro incierto el grupo trabaja en nuevos demos y busca una nueva compa\u00f1\u00eda discogr\u00e1fica, logrando firmar con Warner Music M\u00e9xico. Tras la mala experiencia del primer disco, Fher y Alex estaban concientes de los riesgos que implica ponerse en las manos de un productor que no entend\u00eda el concepto del grupo ni su propuesta art\u00edstica, por lo que optaron por iniciarse en un camino del cual no se han apartado desde entonces: asumir ellos la producci\u00f3n de todos sus discos. Con esa idea en mente graban el \u00e1lbum Falta Amor (1989), que no obtiene \u00e9xito sino hasta un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de su lanzamiento gracias al sencillo \u201cRayando el sol\u201d, el cual se convierte en el primer gran \u00e9xito para Man\u00e1; los sencillos \u201cPerdido en un barco\u201d, \u201cEstoy agotado\u201d y \u201cBusc\u00e1ndola\u201d llegan tambi\u00e9n al gusto de la gente. El grupo realiza 112 presentaciones en M\u00e9xico y su primer concierto multitudinario fuera de las fronteras de su pa\u00eds, en el Coliseo General Rumi\u00f1ahui de Quito, Ecuador. Fue gracias a esta presentaci\u00f3n que el grupo se dio cuenta del potencial que la banda pod\u00eda tener a nivel internacional. \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? En 1991 Man\u00e1 enfrenta el primer cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n con la salida de Ulises Calleros, quien desde entonces se dedica a representar al grupo. Ello signific\u00f3 la llegada de dos nuevos miembros: el tecladista Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y el guitarrista C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n graban en Los \u00c1ngeles en el a\u00f1o 1992 \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os?, \u00e1lbum que constituye un aut\u00e9ntico parteaguas en la historia del grupo y en la del rock en espa\u00f1ol, manteni\u00e9ndose durante 97 semanas en la lista Billboard de los discos m\u00e1s vendidos de Latinoam\u00e9rica. Ocho sencillos de esta producci\u00f3n encabezaron las listas de popularidad en toda la Am\u00e9rica hispanoparlante y se han convertido en temas cl\u00e1sicos de su repertorio: \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, \u201c\u00bfD\u00f3nde jugar\u00e1n los ni\u00f1os?\u201d, \u201cDe pies a cabeza\u201d, \u201cComo te deseo\u201d, \u201cOye mi amor\u201d, \u201cC\u00f3mo diablos\u201d, \u201cTe llor\u00e9 un r\u00edo\u201d y \u201cMe vale\u201d. La globalizaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 inicia en 1993, con una maquinaria promocional de primer nivel y una serie de 268 conciertos en m\u00e1s de 17 pa\u00edses. La gira fue un \u00e9xito y posicion\u00f3 a la banda entre la comunidad latina de Estados Unidos y en mercados como Chile, Ecuador, Per\u00fa, Bolivia, Venezuela y Argentina. Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, dos territorios hist\u00f3ricamente dif\u00edciles de alcanzar para artistas latinos no nativos, fueron tambi\u00e9n conquistados por el fen\u00f3meno de Man\u00e1 gracias a que el tema \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en las listas de popularidad de ambos pa\u00edses, lo cual no hab\u00eda sucedido en 26 a\u00f1os. Este mismo tema se hace merecedor al premio MTV Latino Video Music Award como mejor video del a\u00f1o. En Abril de 1994 y por diferencias art\u00edsticas y profesionales, Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez dejan Man\u00e1 a la mitad de la gira. Por un segundo, el futuro de la banda y su tour estuvo en duda, pero pronto demostraron que la formula de la agrupaci\u00f3n y su esencia segu\u00eda intacta. Para acabar la gira contrataron a los m\u00fasicos Ju\u00e1n Carlos Toribio como apoyo en teclados, Gustavo Orozco en guitarra y Sheila R\u00edos en coros. Man\u00e1 en Vivo Con su nuevo y bien merecido estatus en la escena del rock pop latino internacional, el tr\u00edo compuesto por Fher, Alex y Ju\u00e1n lanzaron el disco Man\u00e1 en Vivo (1994). La idea de lanzar un disco de sus conciertos surge como un medio para capturar la energ\u00eda y revivir cada momento, cada gota de adrenalina y sudor que forman parte de la magia de las presentaciones de Mana. El disco fue grabado entre Agosto y Septiembre de 1994, durante las presentaciones del grupo en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles, la Sports Arena en San Diego, el Aragon Theatre en Chicago, el Teatro Gran Rex en Buenos Aires, el Estadio de Chile en Santiago y la Sala Est\u00e1ndar en Barcelona. Una vez m\u00e1s, la revista Billboard los galardon\u00f3 con el premio al mejor \u00c1lbum Rock/Pop del A\u00f1o. Cuando Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran Deseosos de regresar a su formaci\u00f3n original como cuarteto, Man\u00e1 tiene el tercer y \u00faltimo cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n. La banda audiciona a m\u00e1s de 80 guitarristas de M\u00e9xico, Argentina, Chile y Estados Unidos, hasta que finalmente en Aguascalientes, M\u00e9xico, encuentran al talento que buscaban en Sergio Vall\u00edn, cuya sorprendente sensibilidad, t\u00e9cnica y versatilidad vienen a darle un lustre distinto al sonido de las guitarras en las producciones de la banda. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n y con demos hechos en Guadalajara y Puerto Vallarta, graban y editan el disco Cuando los \u00c1ngeles Lloran (1995) entre Los \u00c1ngeles y el puerto jalisciense. Esta producci\u00f3n, lanzada tres a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su exitoso \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? se distingue por una notable evoluci\u00f3n en la l\u00edrica y el sonido del grupo. Los sencillos \u201cD\u00e9jame entrar\u201d, \u201cNo ha parado de llover\u201d y \u201cHundido en un rinc\u00f3n\u201d no solo representaron un rotundo \u00e9xito en la radio, sino que los videos correspondientes tuvieron una gran rotaci\u00f3n en los canales de m\u00fasica y ganaron diversos premios por su calidad. El disco les permiti\u00f3 una primera nominaci\u00f3n al premio Grammy Americano, el m\u00e1s importante en la industria discogr\u00e1fica. Con el estandarte de un nuevo disco el grupo inicia su nueva gira el 12 de mayo de 1995, con un total de 52 conciertos realizados en 13 pa\u00edses, esto en un per\u00edodo de menos de cinco meses, lo cual mostr\u00f3 el fen\u00f3meno que para ese momento ya significaba Man\u00e1. Durante su visita a Espa\u00f1a en ese mismo a\u00f1o, el grupo se present\u00f3 en la plaza de Las Ventas junto a Revolver y La Uni\u00f3n, donde el p\u00fablico recibi\u00f3 a la banda con los brazos abiertos. La gira Cu\u00e1ndo Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran signific\u00f3 al grupo presentaciones con sold out completos en cada plaza que visitaban. Otros impresionantes logros fueron la inclusi\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 en el festival de Jazz de Montreaux y la conferencia Midem, que tuvieron lugar en Suiza y Francia, respectivamente, una proeza nunca antes alcanzada. Tambi\u00e9n participan con un tema en la pel\u00edcula My Family, a petici\u00f3n del prestigiado director Francis Ford Coppola. Man\u00e1 siempre ha expresado su inter\u00e9s en los problemas que el planeta est\u00e1 enfrentando en materia de ecolog\u00eda, por lo que en Septiembre de 1995 crearon la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre el tema. (www.selvanegra.org.mx) A mediados de Abril de 1996, el grupo continu\u00f3 una extensa y esperada gira por toda la Rep\u00fablica Mexicana. Durante la segunda mitad de 1996 la banda se aventur\u00f3 en una gira de 17 conciertos con localidades agotadas en Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, Santa Barbara, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orle\u00e1ns, Sacramento, Miami, San Jose, Phoenix, San Bernardino, Tucson, Anaheim y las Vegas. Dicho tour les vali\u00f3 importantes art\u00edculos en prestigiosas revistas como Rolling Stone, Time, Details, People Magazine, Newsweek y Pollstar. El 7 de Septiembre de 1996 la banda se presenta dos noches con localidades agotadas en el James Knight Center de Miami, logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda de rock pop latina. La producci\u00f3n le vali\u00f3 al grupo el premio Billboard al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock/Pop Latino, lo cual fijo un record de 6 premios Billboard recibidos en un per\u00edodo de 3 a\u00f1os. Despu\u00e9s de sus presentaciones en Estados Unidos la banda regresa a M\u00e9xico, donde dan 2 exitosos conciertos en la Plaza de Toros de su natal Guadalajara. Durante su estad\u00eda en dicha ciudad, la banda dio una conferencia de prensa para anunciar el lanzamiento de su website; mientras la conferencia ten\u00eda lugar el sitio recibi\u00f3 6000 entradas, una cifra sorprendente tomando en cuenta la \u00e9poca. En Marzo de 1997 la reconocida revista americana especializada en bateristas y la industria de este instrumento, Modern Drummer, public\u00f3 un art\u00edculo sobre Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, en la cual se\u00f1ala a Man\u00e1 como todo un suceso dentro del rock pop latino en Estados Unidos, a la par de reconocer a Alex como uno de los mejores bateristas a nivel mundial dentro del g\u00e9nero. 11 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, en Marzo de 2008 Alex aparece de nuevo en la revista, pero esta vez en una extensa entrevista. Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tras una favorable experiencia de su anterior grabaci\u00f3n en Puerto Vallarta, sitio important\u00edsimo en el atlas creativo de Man\u00e1, el grupo decide regresar para hacer los demos y la grabaci\u00f3n de su pr\u00f3xima producci\u00f3n. As\u00ed, con la ambici\u00f3n de crear m\u00fasica en un ambiente donde el agua, elemento vital como pocos, tuviera una presencia contundente, Man\u00e1 renta una hermosa casa con vista a Bah\u00eda de Banderas, en Conchas Chinas, y graban el disco Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos en 1997. Incontables atardeceres frente al oc\u00e9ano fueron el marco id\u00f3neo para concebir Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, \u00e1lbum producido tambi\u00e9n por Fher y Alex, en colaboraci\u00f3n con Benny Faccone. El resultado fue una energ\u00e9tica mezcla de rock, pop y ritmos latinos que van desde el bosanova hasta el flamenco, pasando por la cadencia caribe\u00f1a del reggae. Importantes sencillos como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Bl\u00e1s\u201d, \u201cHechicera\u201d, \u201cClavado en un bar\u201d y \u201cComo dueles en los labios\u201d se desprenden de esta producci\u00f3n. El disco sali\u00f3 al mercado en Octubre de 1997 y fue lanzado simult\u00e1neamente en 36 pa\u00edses; debut\u00f3 en primer lugar en el Billboard Hot Latin 50 Chart. La producci\u00f3n son\u00f3 fuerte tambi\u00e9n en la Uni\u00f3n Americana y Man\u00e1 se convirti\u00f3 en la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol que se present\u00f3 en El Show de Kathie Lee & Regis, emisi\u00f3n l\u00edder de audiencia en la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense. El 30 de Enero de 1998 la banda inici\u00f3 su gira m\u00e1s ambiciosa, Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos World Tour en Chile, para posteriormente visitar Uruguay y M\u00e9xico. Tras una pausa de 4 semanas debido a que el baterista, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, fue diagnosticado con hepatitis A, el grupo reanud\u00f3 la gira por su natal M\u00e9xico, donde ofrecieron 44 conciertos. Entre las presentaciones que destacan en la gira Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tour 98 se encuentran las de Bolivia, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Chile, Puerto Rico, Honduras, y El Salvador. Otras de las presentaciones m\u00e1s importantes son los conciertos en el Auditorio Nacional, recinto en el que Man\u00e1 rompi\u00f3 r\u00e9cord, pues fue la primera ocasi\u00f3n en que una banda de este g\u00e9nero se presenta siete veces consecutivas sobre este escenario. De vital importancia para la carrera de Man\u00e1 fue ser la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol firmada por la agencia Creative Artist Agency (CAA), con ello Man\u00e1 se un\u00eda a la importante lista de representados que inclu\u00eda a Bon Jovi, AC/DC, Alanis Morissette, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Depeche Mode, Santana, Bob Dylan, George Michael, entre otros. Su primer gira de la mano con CAA inici\u00f3 el 21 de agosto de 1998 en Los \u00c1ngeles, CA y cubri\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 30 ciudades con un total de 36 shows en arenas y anfiteatros, la mayor\u00eda de ellas con llenos totales. Importantes presentaciones tuvieron lugar en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles y en el Rosemont Horizon Arena, donde rompen record al ser el primer grupo de rock pop latino en agotar localidades. Este tour fue el m\u00e1s grande realizado por un grupo de rock pop latino en Estados Unidos. La banda es nominada por sexta vez consecutiva a los premios que otorga la revista Billboard por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, dentro del rubro Mejor \u00c1lbum Pop Rock del A\u00f1o, llev\u00e1ndose el cotizado premio. En diciembre de 1998, Man\u00e1 fue nominado por segunda vez a los Premios Grammy Americanos en la categor\u00eda Mejor \u00c1lbum Latino de Rock/Alternativo por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, premio al que se hicieron merecedores el 24 de febrero de 1999. Este es el primer Grammy otorgado a una banda de rock pop mexicana. Tambi\u00e9n en diciembre de 1998, Fher recibe una invitaci\u00f3n por parte de Carlos Santana para participar en su nuevo material discogr\u00e1fico. Fher compone \u00a8Coraz\u00f3n espinado\u00a8, tema con el cual se abren fronteras para la m\u00fasica latina, tras colocarse este sencillo en los primeros lugares de pa\u00edses europeos, asi\u00e1ticos, y americanos. La grabaci\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 en las ciudades de Los \u00c1ngeles y San Francisco CA, en donde naci\u00f3 una gran amistad entre ambos m\u00fasicos. Como resultado de esta colaboraci\u00f3n, Alex y Fher reciben el premio Grammy como productores y escritores de dicha canci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de realizar junto a Santana una gira por Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico. El grupo comparti\u00f3 arenas, auditorios y estadios de la Uni\u00f3n Americana con Carlos Santana, en una extensa gira que dar\u00eda comienzo el 29 de julio de 1999 en la ciudad de Houston TX, seguida de varias presentaciones por diferentes ciudades de ese estado, para continuar en Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Anaheim, Mountain View, Concord, Sacramento, Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Boise, y Denver. Abrir\u00eda los conciertos el grupo Ozomatli, seguidos de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana alternando el orden de estos en cada una de sus presentaciones. Conciertos hist\u00f3ricos se llevan a cabo en el Arrowhead Pond en Anaheim, donde el grupo realiza cuatro shows sold out. La combinaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana dej\u00f3 sin duda huella en el mercado de rock en espa\u00f1ol, como uno de los acontecimientos m\u00e1s grandes de la historia del g\u00e9nero en los Estados Unidos. En total Man\u00e1 y Santana hab\u00edan realizado 43 shows por Estados Unidos, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Guadalajara, y Monterrey al finalizar la gira en diciembre de 1999. MTV Unplugged La cadena de videos MTV llevaba varios a\u00f1os solicitando a Man\u00e1 su participaci\u00f3n en la serie de grabaciones Unplugged, sin que la banda hubiese podido acceder a la petici\u00f3n debido a los compromisos que le significaban sus grabaciones y extensas giras. Finalmente se dieron las condiciones para el proyecto, por lo que el 9 de Marzo de 1999 la banda graba Man\u00e1 Unplugged en Miami ante un \u00edntimo publico de 70 afortunados fans. En dicho material el grupo incluye \u00e9xitos de su repertorio m\u00e1s 3 covers en modalidad ac\u00fastica; tambi\u00e9n contiene el interludio musical \u00a8Coladito\u00a8, duelo de percusi\u00f3n entre Alex G\u00f3nzalez y el m\u00fasico invitado Lu\u00eds Conte, donde se pude apreciar la destreza de ambos ejecutantes. El 22 de Junio de 1999 el material se lanza a la venta simult\u00e1neamente en todo el continente americano, alcanzando el primer lugar de ventas en el TOP 50 Latino de la revista Billboard, con lo cual la banda repite la haza\u00f1a de ser el \u00fanico grupo de rock latino en lograrlo. Hasta el momento, este disco sigue siendo uno de los m\u00e1s vendidos para la cadena de televisi\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de que fue el primer artista latino en lanzar un material de este tipo (CD/DVD). El primer sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta producci\u00f3n, tema original de Juan Gabriel, \u201cSe me olvid\u00f3 otra vez\u201d permaneci\u00f3 durante m\u00e1s de 5 semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar en las listas de radio de gran parte de M\u00e9xico y Latinoam\u00e9rica. \u201cTe solt\u00e9 la rienda\u201d, del compositor Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez fue otro exitos\u00edsimo sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta grabaci\u00f3n. A principios de enero del 2000, Man\u00e1 recibe la noticia de su nominaci\u00f3n a los premios Grammy en la categor\u00eda de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Pop Latino por su disco MTV Unplugged, esta era la tercera vez consecutiva que el grupo estaba nominado a tan afamados premios. La banda con muchas ganas de tocar arranca una gira por Sudam\u00e9rica y el Caribe el 17 de Marzo de 2000, visitando pa\u00edses como Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Puerto Rico y Republica Dominicana; las presentaciones en la capital Argentina lograron un \u00e9xito y expectaci\u00f3n impresionante, tras ofrecer un concierto en el Estadio Ferro de Buenos Aires a tan solo unas semanas de haber realizado 2 conciertos previos en el Luna Park de esa misma ciudad; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en el estadio Santa Laura, en Santiago de Chile. El resto de la gira luci\u00f3 con llenos totales en todos los lugares en donde Man\u00e1 se present\u00f3. A mediados del mes de abril en la ciudad de Miami, se celebraron los premios Billboard a la M\u00fasica Latina, en los cuales Man\u00e1 recibe 2 premios importantes, el primero al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Pop Latino por su producci\u00f3n MTV Unplugged, y el segundo premio para la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, denominado Spirit of Hope el cual se entrega \u00fanicamente a aquellos artistas que se han destacado por realizar acciones altruistas en pro del medio ambiente y de los derechos humanos. En estas mismas fechas el grupo recibe un reconocimiento que por primera vez se les otorga, el premio que concede la cadena de renta y venta de videos y m\u00fasica m\u00e1s grande de los Estados Unidos, el Block Buster Award por Mejor Artista Latino. En el mes de Junio Man\u00e1 comienza su Gira por Espa\u00f1a y las Canarias en un tour denominado Tourriata, visitando ciudades como: Tenerife, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Toledo, Santiago, Burgos, Palencia, Zamora, Barcelona, Madrid, Victoria, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Gijon, La Coru\u00f1a, Elche, San Javier Murcia, Valencia, Sevilla, San Fernando y M\u00e1laga. Cabe mencionar que en la capital espa\u00f1ola, las dos fechas en la plaza de toros Las Ventas fueron llenos totales, lo cual era una haza\u00f1a dif\u00edcil a\u00fan para los artistas de origen espa\u00f1ol, y un logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda o artista latino. En el resto de la gira que realizaron a lo largo y ancho de la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica lograron igualmente ventas totales. En el mes de septiembre el grupo asiste a la primera entrega del Grammy Latino, en donde junto con Carlos Santana interpretaron el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d, siendo \u00e9ste unos de los momentos m\u00e1s memorables de la noche. En dicha ceremonia Man\u00e1 resulto ganador de 3 Grammy por su participaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1lbum del guitarrista. Durante su estancia en la ciudad de Los \u00c1ngeles, Man\u00e1 es invitado a interpretar el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d al lado de Carlos Santana en el #1 talk show de los Estados Unidos \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d con Jay Leno, quien reconoci\u00f3 a Man\u00e1 como el grupo de rock pop latino m\u00e1s importante. La banda no para y lanza el compilatorio titulado Grandes Man\u00e1, cuya edici\u00f3n se hizo solamente para Europa y Escandinavia; a escasas semanas de haber salido a la venta ocup\u00f3 las primeras posiciones de la radio principalmente de la Pen\u00ednsula It\u00e1lica con el tema \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\u201d. Con este suceso Man\u00e1 visita en Noviembre del 2001 por primera vez Italia, en una gira promocional en la cual realizan un showcase en Mil\u00e1n para medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, personalidades y p\u00fablico en general. Italia adopt\u00f3 a Man\u00e1, la barrera del idioma se rompe y entran directo a los primeros lugares de la radio, apareciendo en las primeras planas de la prensa nacional Italiana. Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor A principios de 2002 la banda se encierra para componer y hacer demos de lo que ser\u00eda su pr\u00f3ximo disco de estudio a tres a\u00f1os del lanzamiento de Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos. Lanzan Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor en Junio de 2002, disco en \u00e9l que se muestra la b\u00fasqueda de la banda por mezclar su esencia con el sonido de rock de los sesentas y setentas, adem\u00e1s de otras fusiones de m\u00fasica latina. El resultado fue una colecci\u00f3n de grabaciones completamente energ\u00e9ticas, con un sonido que privilegia el de las guitarras pero que no renuncia a la b\u00fasqueda y la fusi\u00f3n. Este, su sexto \u00e1lbum de estudio, fue grabado en su totalidad en Los \u00c1ngeles, entre Febrero y Mayo de 2002 y cont\u00f3 con la participaci\u00f3n de Carlos Santana y su guitarra en el tema \u201cJusticia, Tierra y Libertad\u201d, as\u00ed como la de Rub\u00e9n Blades en \u201cS\u00e1banas fr\u00edas\u201d. Cabe destacar que el guitarrista del grupo, Sergio Vall\u00edn, particip\u00f3 cantando el tema \u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 te vas?\u201d, dedicado a sus padres. Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en ventas en Espa\u00f1a, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Estados Unidos durante cinco semanas consecutivas. Tuvo como sencillos m\u00e1s destacados \u201c\u00c1ngel de amor\u201d, \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d y \u201cMariposa traicionera\u201d. Gracias al \u00e9xito obtenido en Italia, el cantante Zucchero los invita a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cBaila morena\u201d, dueto que resulta todo un \u00e9xito tanto en Am\u00e9rica como en Europa. Man\u00e1 le devuelve el gesto al cantante al invitarlo a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d pero ahora en italiano, que luego fue incluida en una edici\u00f3n especial del disco Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor editado en Europa. El 29 de Septiembre de 2002 Man\u00e1 se aventura a una nueva gira de dos a\u00f1os que los pondr\u00eda como nunca antes al mercado internacional. La gira llev\u00f3 al grupo no solo a ciudades de Estados Unidos, M\u00e9xico, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Espa\u00f1a, sino a nuevas plazas como Roma, Mil\u00e1n, Par\u00eds, Berl\u00edn, Eifel, Nuremberg, Munich, Stuggart, Hamburgo, R\u00edo de Janeiro y Sao Paolo. La primera incursi\u00f3n de la banda en el dif\u00edcil mercado brasile\u00f1o se dio con llenos totales; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en sus presentaciones en Italia, Francia y Alemania donde alcanzaron un lugar entre los 30 mejores \u00e1lbumes respecto a ventas. En total, el grupo realiz\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 100 conciertos en 24 pa\u00edses. Durante su estancia por Europa, la banda particip\u00f3 en el especial Pavarotti & Friends al lado de Zucchero, donde se presentaron con estrellas de la talla de Bono, Eric Clapton, Lionel Ritchie, Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin y Andrea Bocceli. Man\u00e1 recibe dos nominaciones en la 4ta entrega de los Grammy Latino que se realizaron en Miami el 3 de Septiembre de 2003, en las categor\u00edas de Mejor Ingenier\u00eda de Grabaci\u00f3n para un \u00c1lbum y Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock por un D\u00fao o Grupo, llev\u00e1ndose esta \u00faltima presea. Esenciales Man\u00e1 El 18 de Noviembre de 2003 el grupo, cansado de tantos a\u00f1os de trabajo, decide tomar un a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y aprovechan para lanzar los recopilatorios Esenciales en tres versiones: Sol, Luna y Eclipse, que incluyen sus temas m\u00e1s exitosos y otras colaboraciones de la banda, como por ejemplo la versi\u00f3n de \u201cFool in the rain\u201d, canci\u00f3n original de Led Zeppelin incluida en el tributo Encomium al legendario grupo ingl\u00e9s y donde Man\u00e1 fue el \u00fanico artista latino invitado. Tambi\u00e9n se encuentra en la compilaci\u00f3n la canci\u00f3n in\u00e9dita \u201cTe llevar\u00e9 al cielo\u201d, tema que se convirti\u00f3 en todo un \u00e9xito, alcanzando r\u00e1pidamente los primeros lugares de popularidad en radio y video. A manera de agradecimiento a sus seguidores, deciden poner a la venta el 12 de Diciembre de 2004 el DVD llamado Acceso Total, el cual incluye im\u00e1genes del tour Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor (2002-2003) m\u00e1s escenas nunca antes vistas en camerinos, permiti\u00e9ndole a los fans tener \u2018acceso total\u2019 a la experiencia que vive Man\u00e1 en sus giras. Amar es Combatir Casi 5 a\u00f1os hab\u00edan pasado desde el \u00faltimo disco de estudio de la banda, Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor, por lo que ya corr\u00edan rumores y especulaciones sobre la separaci\u00f3n del grupo. Lo que nadie sab\u00eda era que tras su a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y desde principios de 2005, Man\u00e1 se reuni\u00f3 para empezar a componer su s\u00e9ptimo disco de estudio, Amar es Combatir. En Febrero de 2006 la banda decide viajar a Miami, ciudad siempre vibrante, abrazada por el ambiente tropical y con una esencia latina que se respira en el aire, comuni\u00f3n id\u00f3nea para inspirar la grabaci\u00f3n de este CD en el que la banda llev\u00f3 a cabo una fusi\u00f3n de rock, pop, m\u00fasica latina, reggae, hasta drum and bass. Producido por Fher y Alex, al igual que sus discos anteriores, Amar es Combatir fue lanzado el 22 de agosto de 2006 y es editado en 40 pa\u00edses alrededor del mundo, alcanzando el n\u00famero 4 en el Top 200 \u00c1lbumes de la revista Billboard en los Estados Unidos, r\u00e9cord solamente alcanzado para una producci\u00f3n enteramente en espa\u00f1ol por el \u00e1lbum Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol. 1 de Shakira. Su primer sencillo, \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, permanece durante ocho semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar de los charts latinos de radio y es nombrado entre los medios latinos m\u00e1s reconocidos de la uni\u00f3n Americana como uno de los tracks m\u00e1s escuchados y premiados del 2006. Los sencillos que le siguieron, \u201cBendita tu luz\u201d (a d\u00fao con Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra) y \u201cManda una se\u00f1al\u201d se posicionan tambi\u00e9n en el primer lugar de las listas de popularidad. A estos se agregar\u00eda un quinto sencillo, \u201cEl rey tibur\u00f3n\u201d, lo cual es un logro a destacar ya que es cada vez menos frecuente que de una producci\u00f3n se desprendan 5 sencillos, dada la complicada situaci\u00f3n por la que atraviesa la industria. En noviembre de 2006 el grupo participa en la 7ma edici\u00f3n del Grammy Latino, donde adem\u00e1s de actuar junto a Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra con un excelente performance de sus \u00e9xitos, que les vali\u00f3 una sentida ovaci\u00f3n de parte de los asistentes al evento y que fue uno de los momentos cl\u00edmax de la velada, reciben un homenaje por su trayectoria art\u00edstica y logros en la m\u00fasica. En febrero de 2007 y tras recibir 5 nominaciones a los premios Billboard Latino, 4 nominaciones a los premios Lo Nuestro y una al Grammy Americano como Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, Man\u00e1 inicia su gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour, con la mayor producci\u00f3n que haya tenido el grupo hasta el momento (m\u00e1s de 60 toneladas de equipo), la cual los llevar\u00eda a dar 116 conciertos durante un per\u00edodo de un a\u00f1o y medio. Los conciertos de Man\u00e1 en Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico, incluyeron shows en ciudades como San Diego, Los \u00c1ngeles, Laredo, Houston, Corpus Christi, Miami, Orlando, Nueva York, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta y San Ju\u00e1n de Puerto Rico. Man\u00e1 se convierte en la primera banda de rock pop en espa\u00f1ol en llenar por tres noches (dos consecutivas) el Madison Square Garden de Nueva York. Destacan tambi\u00e9n sus cuatro conciertos sold out consecutivos en el Staple Center de Los \u00c1ngeles, tres noches sold out en el Miami American Airlines Arena, tres m\u00e1s en el Toyota Center de Houston y cuatro sold out en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico. Adem\u00e1s de reunirse en Washington D.C. con la senadora estadounidense Hillary Clinton para compartir opiniones sobre el medio ambiente y migraci\u00f3n, Man\u00e1 recibe un reconocimiento por las m\u00e1s de 450,000 descargas de su ringtone \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d. Su gira por Latinoam\u00e9rica incluy\u00f3 conciertos en Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Panam\u00e1, Venezuela, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Brasil y Rep\u00fablica Dominicana. El grupo toc\u00f3 en grandes foros, de los cuales destacan los conciertos del grupo en Argentina: tres presentaciones en el Estadio Velez de Buenos Aires as\u00ed como en el Estadio Chateau Carrera de C\u00f3rdoba, el Estadio Central en Rosario y el Estadio Malvinas en Mendoza. Otras presentaciones de gran relevancia fueron: Estadio Defensores del Chaco en Asunci\u00f3n, Estadio del Ej\u00e9rcito en Guatemala, Estadio M\u00e1gico en San Salvador, Estadio de Futbol de Managhua, Estadio Ol\u00edmpico de Caracas, el Parque Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar en Bogot\u00e1, Estadio Alberto Spencer en Guayaquil, Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Atahualpa en Quito, Estadio Alejandro Serrano en Cuenca, Credicard Hall en Sao Paulo, Citibank Hall en Rio de Janeiro, Estadio Gigantinho en Porto Alegre y el Estadio Quisquella en Santo Domingo. Durante Junio y Julio de 2007 llevan su gira a Espa\u00f1a, donde rompen records al posicionarse como el artista latino de mayor convocatoria en la madre patria, al vender todas las localidades para sus conciertos en 15 provincias: Zaragoza, Pamplona, Bilbao, Gij\u00f3n, Santiago, Le\u00f3n, Barcelona, Madrid, Murcia, Alicante, Albacete, M\u00e1laga, Sevilla, Las Palmas y Tenerife. Cabe destacar la nominaci\u00f3n del grupo en los premios World Music Awards, realizados en M\u00f3naco, Francia. Este premio se entrega de acuerdo a las ventas que un artista logr\u00f3 durante un a\u00f1o y donde Man\u00e1 comparti\u00f3 escenario al lado de artistas como Celine Dion, Avril Lavigne, Rihanna, Patty Labelle, entre otros. Entre los premios m\u00e1s destacados que la banda obtuvo por esta producci\u00f3n se encuentra un Grammy Americano en el rubro de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, 3 galardones Lo Nuestro por \u00c1lbum de Rock del A\u00f1o, Artista Rock del A\u00f1o y canci\u00f3n Rock del A\u00f1o; 2 Billboard Latinos por \u00c1lbum Rock Alternativo del A\u00f1o y tema Pop Airplay del A\u00f1o de D\u00fao o Grupo. Arde El Cielo La impresionante respuesta que tuvo la gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour fue una experiencia sorprendente para la banda, por lo que decidieron capturar esa energ\u00eda, esa adrenalina, en una grabaci\u00f3n con la cual sus seguidores pudieran recordar y revivir esos momentos. As\u00ed, la banda decide grabar dos de sus cuatro presentaciones en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico en Marzo de 2007. El 29 de Abril del mismo a\u00f1o Man\u00e1 presenta en Los \u00c1ngeles el CD/DVD llamado Arde el Cielo, el cual fue grabado durante el Amar Es Combatir World Tour. El material contiene 12 temas en directo que representan y repasan la historia de Man\u00e1, desde \u201cRayando el sol\u201d a \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, pasando por \u201cEl rey\u201d y canciones tan conocidas como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\" o \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, as\u00ed como dos temas in\u00e9ditos grabados en estudio. El primero de estos temas in\u00e9ditos es \"Si no te hubieras ido\", una canci\u00f3n de Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds ya versionada por otros artistas pero en la que Man\u00e1 supo poner su peculiar sello. El segundo tema in\u00e9dito del CD es \"Arde el cielo\" un tema compuesto por Fher y producido en conjunto con \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez. Ambos temas serian hits en 2008. Los premios Billboard Latinos reconocieron esta producci\u00f3n otorg\u00e1ndole al grupo 4 galardones en las categor\u00edas de Canci\u00f3n Del A\u00f1o por Grupo o Duo y Tema Pop Airplay del A\u00f1o por \u201cSi no te hubieras ido\u201d, Album Pop de A\u00f1o por Grupo o D\u00fao y \u00c1lbum de rock Alternativo del A\u00f1o por Arde el Cielo.

Born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and raised in Pasadena, California, Jon B. (short for Jonathan Buck) was the son of a professor of music and a concert pianist. Influenced by music found in his grandparents' record store, he began combining the spirit of '70s soul with hip-hop-inspired productions on his 1995 debut album, Bonafide. It peaked on Billboard's R&B Albums chart at number 24, led by the Top Ten R&B single 'Someone to Love,' a duet with prime influence Babyface, and went gold. His second album, 1997's Cool Relax, continued the emphasis on hip-hop soul and featured two of his biggest singles in 'They Don't Know' and the 2Pac-assisted 'Are U Still Down.' As a result, the set sold over a million copies, thus earning it platinum certification. During the following decade, Jon B. released three more albums -- Pleasures U Like (2001), Stronger Everyday (2004), and Helpless Romantic (2008). In 2012, the singer returned with Comfortable Swagg. 2013 B-Sides Collection 23 unreleased tracks from 2001-2012 released on Jon B's Vibezelect Inc label.

He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\n\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\n\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\n\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\n\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\n\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\n\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\n\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\n\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\n\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

In the club he mixes up the likes of new stars Dusky and Huxley with the next level, underground gems he sources from labels and producers across the world, crafted with the kind of experience that only comes from two decades of DJing. The same fervent, crate-digging attitude he\u2019s always been known for can also be found on his radio show, where he champions new talent and obscure tracks he picks up on his travels, having first roadtested them in the booth.\n\n\n\nHis label, UNDR THE RADR, launched in 2014 with his own \u2018Dangerous Thoughts\u2019 track (under his S-Man guise), also saw the collaboration \u2018Drop The Needle\u2019 with Man Without A Clue & Kevin Knapp. The collaborations with Huxley (\u2018The Calling\u2019) and Tough Love (\u2018In The Name Of Love\u2019) followed suit, continuing the theme of exploring new ground that was shown with his \u2018Amour\u2019 single for Riva Starr\u2019s Snatch label.\n\n\n\nFrom a humble beginning in NYC to multi-year residencies in Ibiza; from digging in dusty crates to headlining festival main-stages around the world, Roger is truly a self-made man and and dance music star. The crafting of Roger Sanchez, the DJ, started in the late 80s in Corona, Queens, where as a young man he was enticed by the early roots of hip-hop sprouting all over New York. Attending parties by the Bronx River and other jams as a break-dancer and graffiti artist, Sanchez was introduced to DJ\u2019ing through friends, trying his hand in an organic environment where his creativity behind the decks flourished from a few singles into an ambitious catalogue of over two thousand original productions and remixes.\n\n\n\nThese tracks have not always been under his own name, though. Roger has released music under a slew of monikers, including S-Man, Roger S., The Nu-Solution, Underground Solution, DV8, Ego Trip, El Mariachi, The Funkjunkeez, Tribal Infusion, Twilight, and Transatlantic Soul amongst others. Each new name has allowed him to push his music in unique yet blended directions, allowing him to carve parallel and weaving paths through the tastes of the times while enjoying opportunities to break out of the known.\n\n\n\nAnyone who\u2019s DJ\u2019d knows that you have to put in work, both to sharpen your skills and to find those unique cuts that no one else has. Early on, Roger became a dedicated crate digger, searching for obscure samples and break beats in influential NYC record stores like Rock & Soul and Vinylmania.\n\n\n\nFormerly a talented student of the arts who attended the Pratt Institute\u2019s School of Architecture, music culture grew to encompass Roger\u2019s life as he began to sell his own mixtapes on the sidewalks of Broadway in order to finance his earliest gigs. With encouragement from his father, an engineer, Roger put his thoughts about a career in architecture on hold and launched himself into music full-time. His first 12-inch, \u201cDreamworld\u201d, came out on the Outer Limits imprint in 1990 under the name Egotrip. It was around this time, that Sanchez began to take producing seriously as a compliment to his DJ\u2019ing. He soon released \u201cLuv Dancin\u201d for Gladys Pizarro on the iconic Strictly Rhythm records under the name Underground Solution, which led to his first tour.\n\n\n\nRoger hasn\u2019t stopped grinding since, using his decades of experience to build enticing remixes for a wide range of artists such as Michael Jackson, The Police, Diana Ross, Jamiroquai, Maroon 5 and even the So-Cal punk-pop outfit, No Doubt, for which he won a Grammy in 2003 for Best Remixed Recording with the song \u201cHella Good\u201d.\n\n\n\nAn early pioneer of podcasting, Roger was awarded the first-ever Best Podcast Award at the International Dance Music Awards in 2007. In addition to his bi-weekly podcast, he also hosts a weekly terrestrial and online radio show, which attracts over 10 million listeners across a worldwide audience. The Release Yourself Radio Show is broadcasted in 30 markets on every continent, including countries as diverse as Brazil, Russia, Mexico, the UK, Germany and Australia. In addition to broadcasting, he creates podcasts and mixes from the road, dominating a tour schedule that would exhaust even the most hardened of festival warriors. This man is on a mission to spread the musical word to every corner of the globe. In addition to his tireless touring, broadcasting and producing schedule, Roger has held prominent residencies on the island of Ibiza since the year 2000 at some of the biggest superclubs on The White Isle, including Pacha, Space and Amnesia; after taking a break in 2015 he\u2019ll return there in 2016. With a true international appeal, real fans look to house music leaders like Sanchez to keep music\u2019s honesty at the forefront of their vision. Furthermore, he has carefully assembled celebrated compilation albums under the Release Yourself title every year since 2002, showcasing his own work alongside tunes from both established and new talents.\n\n\n\nEver evolving on his hustle, always pushing himself, and others, to do better, the S-Man sums it up perfectly when he states: \u201cI\u2019m always moving forward, but never losing sight of where I\u2019ve been.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Rise up for Roger Sanchez!"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "YOOKiE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9518745.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Sat Nov 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-30", "Genre": "Genres: Fuck a genre, Bass, Dubstep, Trap, Bass Music", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "The art within the artificial: instrumentation computed in utter harmony with the brains of those willing to lend themselves, their ears, and their youth to the ends of ecstasy.
