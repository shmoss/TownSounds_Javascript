And that makes Rodg one of the rare-breed. The humble Dutchman is one of the best kept Armada Music secrets, delivering top-notch releases on a regular basis.\n\nAn impressive string of features on various Armada compilations proved to be the stepping stone for Rodg, renowned for a sound that sticks out. Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren. Seeing his in-studio diligence pay off, Rodg released his debut album in mid-2016 and grabbed early support from Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery and Above & Beyond, all the while riding the US airwaves with title track \u2018High On Life\u2019, which accumulated over two million streams on Spotify to date.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t stop there. After countless collaborations with long-time friend and production partner Ruben de Ronde, on came a collaborative effort that dropped jaws and pushed their sound to an even higher level. With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more. He is the workhorse of the Armada family and a mainstay on countless worldwide Dance compilations. He is the present and the future of Electronic Dance Music, yet seemingly always underrated.

With an electric live show, relentless touring schedule, and unwavering work ethic, they\u2019ve built a hallmark brand that was even recognized byEntreprenuer.com after seeing the band\u2019s merchandise worn by the likes of The Cadillac Three, Dustin Lynch and Maddie and Tae.\n\n\u201cWhen the band started back in 2011, it was basically just a platform for me and my buddy Russ to write songs and play for free beer in our hometown bar. Since then, it has been amazing to watch it grow into a bigger operation. The majority of the line-up we have now has been grinding together for around 5 years. Our growth into a full band kind of happened organically. We just started writing and jamming as friends in college and we haven\u2019t really stopped since\", explains lead singer Brock Jones.\n\nThe five best friends are excited to release their first EP since making the move to Nashville in January of 2017. \"Let\u2019s Do This\" features six brand new songs produced by rock producer Greg Archilla and renowned Nashville guitar man, Ilya Toshinskiy. \u201cWhen we first met Greg, we didn\u2019t know what to think. I mean, here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s built a career working with rock legends! It didn't take long to realize we were a good fit after coming out of the first writing session with a song like \"Sombrero.\" Then there's Ilya, an absolute machine in the studio. He brought the banjo licks and post-country swag to tracks like \u201cCountry Song\u201d and \u201cBeer Talkin'\",\u201d recounts lead guitar player and Co-producer Brooks Boyer.\n\nThe guys collaborated with Adam James, long time friend and songwriter with Three Ring Circus in Nashville, to round out the EP with his writing skills on \u201cBeer Talkin\u2019\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Do This\". Nothing was off limits during the recording process. \u201cOur influences range from Def Leppard to Shania Twain, Fall Out Boy to Nelly. We try not to confine our sound to any one genre, we just want people to listen to the music and decide for themselves\", asserts Brock.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to try and write songs that our fans can relate to and it kind of feels like a big family that we have been lucky enough to bring together. Though we've been told that our name is a bit strange, we take a lot of pride in being BROSEPHS. That name gives some insight into our lives together on the road, and even more than that, we really enjoy promoting friendship amongst everyone we come in contact with. We want everyone to be a BROSEPH\u201d, says Sean Halbrook, bass player and background vocalist.\n\nThe BROSEPHS have built a \u201cGood Reputation\u201d in the last two years, pouring their high energy into every show as they continuously span the entire country in their touring rig aptly named Van Morrison & Trailer Swift. The highly talented act has recently opened shows for Steven Tyler, Cole Swindell, Dustin Lynch, Old Dominion, Luke Combs and Granger Smith, to name a few.\n\nBROSEPH'S 2015 independent release, \"Fill 'Em On Up\", was well-received, landing a Music Row TOP 40 Single with \"Right Where She Wants Me\" (37) and a Music Row TOP 60 Single with \"Fill 'Em On Up\" (58).

Though he remains among the most pop-friendly of today's singer-songwriters - his songs regularly appear in hit movie and TV soundtracks , fans say he has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger more successfully than any of his songwriting peers. According to an article by Stephen Thanabalan in Rolling Stone Magazine, Paul's style has also been most notably influential in the late 1990s thru mid 2000s with his prescience vis a vis his unique music and sound: featuring a combination of dextrously deep and smooth vocals as well as raw guitar 'roots' stylistics; emulated most evidently in the industry in ensuing years with the mainstream emergence of melancholic rock and folk pop solo artistes like Rascal Flatts, James Blunt, Damien Rice and Jack Johnson.", "otherInfo": "ELLIS PAUL\u2019S TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOW Returns this Friday May 22nd at 7:30pm EST on Facebook Live at Ellis Paul Music and More!

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion. Now, 2016 finds him writing, touring, and releasing new material, with his sights set on expanding well beyond the two cities of his origin.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No more pjs for me!

Godog was founded by Warner Brothers Records Alumni to create an all encompassing music company that supports it's artists with radio promotion and publicity. \"Not Ready to Say I'm Sorry Yet\" is the first release from the joint venture.\n\nMark grew up listening to great songwriters. With Prince, Billy Joel, Little Texas and Garth Brooks as early inspirations, he quickly learned how to write passionate songs. As an only child, he was forced to play all the instruments himself writing and recording over 200 songs before finishing High School.\n\nWhen asked to contribute a song for the local Homeless Awareness Project in his hometown of Toledo, OH, he wrote the song, \"Where's Santa Now?\" That song instantly got airplay so he volunteered to promote the charity in a multi-city holiday acoustic tour.\n\nThe story took a big jump when Radio Promotion legend, Bill Scull heard his song, \"Little Breakdown\" at an ASCAP demo review session. Scull, who has worked in the industry for years with Clive Davis, singled him out, signed Mark to his EO label, and sent him out to record his label\u2019s first CD.\n\nScull said, \u201cThe thing I learned from Clive is that the song is king\u2026and Lorenzo has those songs.\u201d\n\nHis talent also caught the attention of publisher Jan Seedman (who discovered Nickelback for Road Runner Records), \u201cMark knows how to come up with a melody... the songs just don\u2019t get tired - ever.\u201d\n\nThe new CD is really a great collection of Mark\u2019s favorite songs plus an unreleased Little Texas track. As he was recording the CD, a friend slipped some of the unfinished demos to Del Gray of Little Texas. Del loved the songs and sent over a song that is now on the Southbound75 CD.\n\nToday, with Southbound75\u2019s new CD about to be released, Mark and the guys are looking forward to getting back to what they do best \u2013 playing live and meeting people. The band is constantly touring the midwest, east coast and their current home state of Florida. All of the musicians in Southbound75 are seasoned professionals who put on a high-energy live show.\n\nMark\u2019s songs have been used on TV shows, sports programming, DVDs, Cartoons and more such as; \u201cESPN College Football;\u201d \u201cShark\u201d (CBS); \u201c90210\u201d (CW); \u201cThreshold\u201d (CBS); \u201cGirlfriends\u201d (CW) and \u201c3lbs\u201d on (CBS).\n\nThe band is endorsed by many sponsors including, Red Monkey Hats and Accessories, Bosphorus Cymbals & American Crew \u2013 \"Official Supplier to Men\"\n\nSouthbound 75 just finished playing every day at the 2020 Florida State Fair and were just named one of Reverbnation's Top Emerging Country Acts.", "otherInfo": "Live Acts from a real stage in Tampa, FL sponsored by Se7ven Music Productions and Tampa Production Association"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Blaggards ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388222.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Irish, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Blaggards (no \u201cthe\u201d, pronounced BLA\u2019 GUARDS or BLA\u2019 GHERDS, depending on where you\u2019re from) formed July 2004 in Houston, Texas.\n\nWe play what we call Stout Irish Rock, traditional Irish music mixed with rock n\u2019 roll, informed by everything from Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley to Thin Lizzy and Black Sabbath.

With an electric live show, relentless touring schedule, and unwavering work ethic, they\u2019ve built a hallmark brand that was even recognized byEntreprenuer.com after seeing the band\u2019s merchandise worn by the likes of The Cadillac Three, Dustin Lynch and Maddie and Tae.\n\n\u201cWhen the band started back in 2011, it was basically just a platform for me and my buddy Russ to write songs and play for free beer in our hometown bar. Since then, it has been amazing to watch it grow into a bigger operation. The majority of the line-up we have now has been grinding together for around 5 years. Our growth into a full band kind of happened organically. We just started writing and jamming as friends in college and we haven\u2019t really stopped since\", explains lead singer Brock Jones.\n\nThe five best friends are excited to release their first EP since making the move to Nashville in January of 2017. \"Let\u2019s Do This\" features six brand new songs produced by rock producer Greg Archilla and renowned Nashville guitar man, Ilya Toshinskiy. \u201cWhen we first met Greg, we didn\u2019t know what to think. I mean, here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s built a career working with rock legends! It didn't take long to realize we were a good fit after coming out of the first writing session with a song like \"Sombrero.\" Then there's Ilya, an absolute machine in the studio. He brought the banjo licks and post-country swag to tracks like \u201cCountry Song\u201d and \u201cBeer Talkin'\",\u201d recounts lead guitar player and Co-producer Brooks Boyer.\n\nThe guys collaborated with Adam James, long time friend and songwriter with Three Ring Circus in Nashville, to round out the EP with his writing skills on \u201cBeer Talkin\u2019\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Do This\". Nothing was off limits during the recording process. \u201cOur influences range from Def Leppard to Shania Twain, Fall Out Boy to Nelly. We try not to confine our sound to any one genre, we just want people to listen to the music and decide for themselves\", asserts Brock.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to try and write songs that our fans can relate to and it kind of feels like a big family that we have been lucky enough to bring together. Though we've been told that our name is a bit strange, we take a lot of pride in being BROSEPHS. That name gives some insight into our lives together on the road, and even more than that, we really enjoy promoting friendship amongst everyone we come in contact with. We want everyone to be a BROSEPH\u201d, says Sean Halbrook, bass player and background vocalist.\n\nThe BROSEPHS have built a \u201cGood Reputation\u201d in the last two years, pouring their high energy into every show as they continuously span the entire country in their touring rig aptly named Van Morrison & Trailer Swift. The highly talented act has recently opened shows for Steven Tyler, Cole Swindell, Dustin Lynch, Old Dominion, Luke Combs and Granger Smith, to name a few.\n\nBROSEPH'S 2015 independent release, \"Fill 'Em On Up\", was well-received, landing a Music Row TOP 40 Single with \"Right Where She Wants Me\" (37) and a Music Row TOP 60 Single with \"Fill 'Em On Up\" (58).

According to an article by Stephen Thanabalan in Rolling Stone Magazine, Paul's style has also been most notably influential in the late 1990s thru mid 2000s with his prescience vis a vis his unique music and sound: featuring a combination of dextrously deep and smooth vocals as well as raw guitar 'roots' stylistics; emulated most evidently in the industry in ensuing years with the mainstream emergence of melancholic rock and folk pop solo artistes like Rascal Flatts, James Blunt, Damien Rice and Jack Johnson.", "otherInfo": "ELLIS PAUL\u2019S TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOW Returns this Friday May 22nd at 7:30pm EST on Facebook Live at Ellis Paul Music and More!

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion. Now, 2016 finds him writing, touring, and releasing new material, with his sights set on expanding well beyond the two cities of his origin.

You\u2019ll find a little bit of everything in the 40+minute opus: a smattering of trip-hop during \u201cAround The Outside\u201d, rock exuberance to \u201cThrowback;\u201d a touch of floating ambience to the dreamy \u201cI Don\u2019t Know Where We Are\u201d, and some gritty funkiness to \u201cOn the Run.\u201d Basically, Injeti is a walking encyclopedia of musical knowledge, and he\u2019s constantly tapping into his own brain to source it. \u201cOne of my biggest tools is my knowledge of music, more than my beat-making or my playing abilities,\u201d Injeti admits. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people that when I produce a record, I could tell you what I\u2019m trying to do, reference it, tell you who played on it, when it was recorded, why it was recorded. I\u2019m a nerd like that. It really helps me when I make records.\u201d It\u2019s a task that has not only served him well on his own work, but the impressive list of clients he\u2019s amassed in the past few years, many with his production partner DJ Khalil. Among the superstars that they\u2019ve written for and produced: Detroit rap icon Eminem (the GRAMMY winning album Recovery & Call of Duty: Ghosts track \u201cSurvival\u201d); Houston Christian hip-hop artist Lecrae's Grammy-winning album, Gravity; multi-million-seller Pennsylvania pop doyenne P!nk\u2019s album, The Truth About Love; and LA\u2019s Aloe Blacc\u2019s, Lift Your Spirit. There\u2019s been Injeti\u2019s work with Toronto rapper Drake (So Far Gone EP), California hip-hop producing icon Dr. Dre, New York rapper 50 Cent (Before I Self-Destruct), Virginia hip-hop trio Clipse featuring Kanye West (\u201cKinda Like A Big Deal\u201d), Vancouver\u2019s Swollen Member contributor Mad Child. On top of all that there are projects he\u2019s working on with A$AP Rocky, Emeli Sande, Overdoz and a group he\u2019s a part of called The New Royales, also including DJ Khalil, Liz Rodrigues, and Erik Alcock. Their latest work being co-writing, along with Eminem and featuring Gwen Stefani, and producing a song called \u201cKings Never Die\u201d for the Weinstein Company\u2019s new movie, Southpaw, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. \u201cI do what I do for everybody,\u201d Injeti explains. It\u2019s incredible! I facilitate ideas and whatever visions people have. \u201cI have a sound with Khalil that\u2019s kind of organic rock, hip-hop, but it\u2019s not really one genre. It just feels natural the way it happens, and I feel very blessed.\u201c \u201cMusic is a universal language more than any other language to me,\u201d says Injeti. \u201cEveryone speaks it. Everyone loves it. Everyone feels something from it. Creator of sound driven moments for and with Dj Khalil, Eminem.

Dedicating their 1996 debut 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi' to bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim, the Washington, D.C.-based duo have spent nearly two decades creating boundary-warping, complexly crafted electronic music partly inspired by bossa nova\u2019s intricate rhythms and lush textures. Now, with their seventh studio album 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation present their first release devoted entirely to the Brazilian-born genre that first connected them. \u201cWe always try to progress into something different and stretch our musical chops, and taking a whole album to dive into this one sound seemed like a really great way to do that,\u201d says Hilton. Adds Garza: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a departure for us, but at the same time these are our roots, this is what brought us together. It\u2019s us coming full circle from electronic music back to something organic before we move on to our next chapter.\u201d\n\nReleased on their own label ESL Music, 'Saudade' borrows its title from a Portuguese word meaning \u201ca longing for something or someone that is lost, a contented melancholy, or, simply, the presence of absence.\u201d \u201cSaudade is the essence or feeling of true bossa nova,\u201d explains Hilton, who names \u201cthose warm, soulful, melancholic vocals\u201d as one of the elements of bossa nova that\u2019s most alluring to him. Drawing influence from classic Brazilian performers like Antonio Carlos Jobim, Gal Costa, and Luis Bonf\u00e1\u2014along with Serge Gainsbourg, Ennio Morricone, and more modern artists like electro-samba pioneer Isabelle Antena\u2014Saudade achieves its delicate yet deeply sensuous sound with the help of more than a dozen guest musicians. With each track sung by one of five female vocalists (including longtime Thievery cohort LouLou Ghelichkhani, newcomer Elin Melgarejo, Nouvelle Vague singer Karina Zeviani, Argentine chanteuse Natalia Clavier, and former Bitter:Sweet singer/songwriter Shana Halligan), the endlessly mesmerizing album also features such guests as U.N.K.L.E. drummer Michael Lowery, Argentine singer/songwriter Federico Aubele, and master Brazilian percussionist Roberto Santos.\n\nAlthough Thievery Corporation stay true to traditional bossa nova\u2019s elegant fusion of samba and jazz all throughout 'Saudade,' the album is rich with strange and wonderful flourishes that revel in the duo\u2019s hyper-inventive tendencies. Opening with the dusky \u201cD\u00e9collage,\u201d 'Saudade' glides from the smoldering and string-drenched \u201cQuem Me Leva\u201d to the hushed and mysterious \u201cSola In Citta\u201d (an Italian-sung nod to the legendary sound tracks of Ennio Morricone, featuring Wurlitzer electric piano by Enea Diotaiuti) to the sweetly ethereal \u201cNo More Disguise\u201d (a dream-like piece laced with orchestral strings and bolero rhythms). With the instrumental title track serving as its gently stunning centerpiece, 'Saudade' also offers the sultry and spacey\u201cClaridad\u201d (a swaying Latin number propelled by analog organ beats) and the French lullaby of \u201cLe Coeur\u201d (featuring the sublime saxophone work of Frank Mitchell, Jr.). And on the final track \u201cDepth of My Soul,\u201d Halligan delivers a haunting vocal performance that merges with the song\u2019s swirling symphonic soundscape to hypnotic effect.\n\nOver the years, Thievery Corporation have given nods to their bossa-nova influence on individual album tracks, slipping those quietly enchanting songs into recordings that reveal the duo\u2019s careful studying of everything from Jamaican dub reggae to punk to vintage film soundtracks to psychedelic space rock. After coming up with sketches for several bossa-nova-style numbers while recording their last studio album (2011\u2019s Culture of Fear), Garza and Hilton considered releasing an EP showcasing a handful of Brazilian-inspired songs. \u201cThe more we worked on those songs, the more we got into the vibe of that vintage, organic sound,\u201d recalls Hilton. \u201cMaking an album fully dedicated to that sound felt like a good idea, especially at a time when the electronic dance music world is so saturated and there\u2019s not much of a focus on musicianship.\u201d Rather than feeling hemmed in by the unfamiliar approach of creating music solely in one style, Thievery Corporation found a great deal of freedom in writing and recording the songs that make up 'Saudade.' \u201cIn a way it was really liberating to do something out of our wheelhouse, to put ourselves in a totally different mindset and immerse ourselves in this one particular genre,\u201d notes Garza.\n\nIntense musical exploration has always been essential to Thievery Corporation, a project hatched in 1995 when Hilton and Garza were introduced by a mutual friend at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Eighteenth Street Lounge\u2014a popular gathering spot for musicians that\u2019s co-owned by Hilton. Soon after making their 1996 debut with two underground hit vinyl singles(\u201cShaolin Satellite\u201d and \u201c2001 Spliff Odyssey\u201d) and 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi,' the duo became loosely associated with the trip-hop scene that had newly emerged in the UK. In 2000, they released 'Mirror Conspiracy,' which introduced live vocalists (including Bebel Gilberto and the late Pam Bricker) into the project\u2019s mix. Following 2002\u2019s 'The Richest Man in Babylon' and 2005\u2019s 'The Cosmic Game' (featured politically minded collaborations with Perry Farrell, Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne, and David Byrne), Thievery Corporation put out 2006\u2019s 'Versions' (a compilation of their remixes of songs by such artists as Sarah McLachlan, Astrud Gilberto, Anoushka Shankar, and The Doors). By then, Garza and Hilton were itching to evolve past their reputation as ambassadors of the downtempo scene, and began to conjure up more subversive recordings that reflected their passion for social activism, as heard on both 2008\u2019s 'Radio Retaliation' and 'Culture of Fear.'\n\nNow on 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation are once again changing direction, trading the fiery energy of their last two albums for a wistful mood and summery spirit\u2014a shift that both members found highly refreshing. \u201cEven though we\u2019re very socially conscious, it\u2019s nice to take a break from the political theme and just concentrate creating some beautiful songs in the same vein as all these old records that we love,\u201d says Garza. And as one ofthe most influential and respected names on the electronic/dance music scene, Thievery Corporation also discovered their own breed of rebellion and innovation in committing themselves to a time-worn genre on 'Saudade.'\u201cWe\u2019re still chopping up beats, but this time we\u2019re making them sound warm and vintage\u2014which is not at all what\u2019s happening in electronic music right,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is pretty traditional and timeless-sounding, and in that it\u2019s completely contrarian.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join our global community for a special event class led by Janet Stone, with live music by Rob Garza of the legendary electronic duo Thievery Corporation.

Music, 2016) and a Top 10 Best New Guitarists in the World (Total Guitar, 2018) .\n\nNow, with singles such as 2018\u2019s rockers \u201cBreaking Down\u201d and \u201cNo Good\u201d and his 2019 release, a soulful ballad \u201cWhat You Do To Me,\u201d all receiving national radio support in the US, Germany and Australia, Hamish\u2019s sophomore record Out Of My Head already illustrates the sonic diversity of his craft as a matured, thoughtful, and effectively emotive song-writer. While \u201cBreaking Down\u201d and \u201cNo Good\u201d are superb examples of rollicking rock, they are just one of many genres that Hamish dips his toes into on the new album Out Of My Head, produced by Jim Scott (Tom Petty, Tedeschi Trucks Band). Americana, soul, pop, roots, blues, rock; that\u2019s a lot of ground to cover, but Hamish does it with a natural ease that\u2019s far beyond his years. The mellow (\"What You Do To Me\", \"Damaged Goods\") and the upbeat (\"No Good\", \"You Give Me Something\") tracks on this record sit comfortably next to each other; all buoyed by a knack for clever, hook-driven songwriting and a clear, burning passion that drives the music from the first strum to the last. Three songs from Out of My Head are on Spotify\u2019s Nu Blues Official Playlist.\n\nHamish has opened for BB King, The Rides (featuring Stephen Stills), Vintage Trouble, Drive By Truckers, Doyle Bramhall II, Low Cut Connie; and toured the US while appearing at US festivals such as BottleRock, Firefly, performed 11 performances at SXSW (2017); Echo Park Rising, Mountain Jam, High Sierra, Big Blues Bender, Summerfest, Telluride Blues & Brews Festival and Canada\u2019s RBC Bluesfest Ottawa.\n\nKicking off 2019, Hamish opened for Gary Clark Jr on his Australia tour, appeared at Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, TN and he will continue touring US, Canada and Europe throughout the rest of the year in support of his new album release.\n\nHamish\u2019s second album, entitled Out of My Head, released May 2019.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ari and the Alibis LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10081824.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Jazz Blues, Funk, Soul, Samba, Bossa Nova, Groove, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "See Website: www.ariandthealibis.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "BEN LAW LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8110587.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Country, Pop, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Nashville, TN native, Ben Law has country music in his blood. His passion for music started early in life. His earliest musical memories involve listening to artists and groups from Vince Gill to Journey, Bryan Adams to smaller Christian and gospel groups of people that his mother sang with while in college. These would go on to deeply shape his tastes and style. Though Ben's family lived just outside of Nashville, much of his time growing up was spent on his grandparent's farm in the town in south Georgia of Cairo. Just as with hearing various styles of music, the experiences and lessons learned from this time influenced Ben's perspective on his music. From the time he was 4 years old, Ben constantly took part in youth church choirs, school talent shows and a few different bands as he discovered more and more about his own sound as an artist. By the time he was in high school, songwriting had become a major focus and goal for him alongside the performing that he had long been captivated with. After graduating from Centennial High School in Franklin, TN, Ben was accepted to Belmont University where he currently studies Music Business. During his first three years there, he has met a number of incredible people who have further influenced his direction as an artist and a writer and continually pushed him to be better. Ben is currently working on both writing and recording new music and looking to play as much as possible in and around Nashville. This is the official Facebook page of Ben Law.

This began a long line of awards and accolades as well as opportunities to work in Tokyo, Los Angeles, Paris and in London where she garnered the coveted \u201cLaurence Olivier\u201d Award nomination as Best Actress for her tour de force portrayal of jazz legend Billie Holiday in Stephen Stahl\u2019s Lady Day.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013.

Instead it was his dad that helped shape his musical palate as father and son first farmed together and then worked side by side building custom motorcycles, motors and restoring classic cars, all to dad\u2019s soundtrack of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Dr. Hook.\n\nDustin attended college ultimately earning a Master's degree and landing a job in corporate banking. In the end, his career took him far from the finance world as he became the owner of his own business building muscle cars for six years, but even the need for speed didn\u2019t give him what he truly wanted.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to play music,\u201d says Olson. \u201cEven when I was working in racing and had my shop, I would always go see live music and wish I could do that.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2009 that Dustin mentioned to his brother Jared how he wished he could play. Remembering that conversation Jared, a guitar player himself, gifted Dustin a jet black Stratocaster. Dustin dove in but like most guitar students, got frustrated and within a few months he put the guitar down, opting instead to run sound for a local country band. That led to Dustin hosting open mic nights at a local bar which reignited his desire to play, so much so he walked into a local guitar shop and walked out with his new best friend, an acoustic Taylor guitar.\n\nFrom that point his sole focus was learning to play, eventually learning enough chords to play George Strait\u2019s \u201cTroubadour.\u201d Excited he showed his brother who immediately insisted on dragging Dustin onstage to perform it with him that night. That night turned into another night, and another, until Dustin formally joined his brother and Melissa Olson to become a full-fledged acoustic trio performing gigs all over the area as The Olson Band.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Olson formed his own band, the Blue Collar Rebellion. Playing many of the same bars, Olson performed primarily covers but introduced his newfound fans to the likes of \u2018red dirt\u2019 country. Artists like Cross Canadian Ragweed, Pat Green, Bart Crow, Randy Rogers, Charlie Robison filled his set lists and began to lay the groundwork for the songwriter Dustin was becoming.\n\nWhile he became more and more comfortable onstage, it was the loss of his mother in October of 2013 that solidified his belief in himself. On the day of her memorial service he and his brother strapped on their guitars and performed their mom\u2019s favorite song, Eric Church\u2019s \u201cLike Jesus Does\u201d and likewise played it again at their show that night. Understandably the second time around was too much but Dustin got through the tears, the song and the show because he knew that\u2019s what his mom would want him to do.\n\nBy 2015 Dustin was taking regular trips to Nashville. The visits got more frequent and Nashville got harder and harder to leave to the point he eventually gave in to his heart, selling his business and in early 2016 making the move to Music City.\n\n\u201cIt was exactly where I wanted to be and scary as hell all at the same time. I don\u2019t think I played out live for the first nine months I lived in Nashville because everyone is so good.\u201d\n\nThe days of self-doubt are now a thing of the past as Olson has forged a number of friendships and writing partnerships with some of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite, some even considering him in that circle as well. Now with a fully loaded band behind him the time has come to pack up his guitar, load up his growing list of songs and take it all out where it needs to be to breathe \u2013 out on the road.\n\n\n\nThe Music\n\nAfter countless hours of songwriting and the production brilliance of Marc \"Butter\" Fortney (Trailer Choir) Dustin's debut EP, \"Prayer Of A Simple Man,\" was released in November of 2017. The album reached as high as #14 on the iTunes country Pre-Order chart and debuted in the top 100 on the iTunes country chart on release day. Since its release the songs of \"Prayer of a Simple Man\" have gathered nearly 25,000 streams and racked up over 20,000 music video views in 2018 alone.\n\n\n\nMoving forward 2019 is already shaping up to be a big year with a whole bunch of new music and new tour locations already on the calendar. Dustin's next single, \"Memories We Didn't Make,\" is set to release on March 1st and is a complete change of pace from the fun party songs that made up his debut EP. This new single, inspired by a breakup, shows a softer more fragile side of Dustin that we have not previously seen. Dustin is planning on releasing at least two more songs by the end of the summer and using all of that forward momentum and new material to take his touring and music to the next level throughout the year.", "otherInfo": "\ud83d\udce3NEW MUSIC ALERT! 05.08.20 Pre-Save \"Make You Fall\" Today! https://ffm.to/makeyoufall.opr\n\nThen join me for a first listen on May 8th.

He's showing. Appropriately titled, the song \"Country\" is as much positioning statement as introduction. In three minutes and 16 seconds, it is almost precisely who he is in word and deed. The vocal delivery, storytelling, musicianship and reflections of his outdoor lifestyle \u2013 as well as faith, family and patriotism \u2013 offer a spot-on portrayal. Joined by early fan favorites \"Clean Up On Aisle Five\" and \"Come Do A Little Life,\" the song carves an unmistakably country yet completely fresh groove for the genre. In short, it sounds like nothing else, but absolutely belongs.\n\nTo paraphrase the song, a life in music isn't a place on a map; it's a place in Mo Pitney's heart. \"I just love music,\" Pitney says, exhibiting atypical maturity for someone still in their early twenties. \"It has never been about praise. Playing the Grand Ole Opry was an amazing experience, but I have just as much fun sitting on my bed playing along to an old record. It's always been that way.\"\n\nThat music-centered outlook is already generating the unsought acclaim of which he speaks. Perhaps the best example is the aforementioned Opry performance. \"Everybody asked me if I was nervous, but I don\u2019t think I was,\" he says. \"I definitely thought about it a lot more than I normally do. My respect for that stage and the circle is great.\n\nFor his first song, he selected \"Clean Up On Aisle Five\" and eyed one goal: to sing his heart out. \"I didn't feel like anybody was sucked into the song at all, but when it was over I stepped back from the microphone and people erupted,\" he says. A standing ovation approaching a full minute ensued. \"After about 30 seconds, I stepped forward to say something because I thought I heard them dying down, but they just got louder. I lost it. It took me about a week to come off that feeling.\"\n\nThat pivotal moment capped a journey that started in the red brick town of Cherry Valley, IL, where Mo grew up loving the outdoors. \"Right out my back door was a lake about a mile away,\" he says. \"I'd ride my bike there with a fishing pole on each handlebar, like two tridents sticking out in front of me.\"\n\nMusic was a family affair, and Pitney picked up the drums at six and guitar at 12. \"I learned how to play with a cast on my arm by laying a rag over my dad's guitar so it wouldn't get scratched,\" he says. \"Johnny Cash At San Quentin was my introduction to playing music. I learned the whole album.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, he played two Cash songs at an open mic night \u2013 his first public performance. \"After I played, I saw a guy backstage playing a banjo, so I picked that up for a couple of years. By age 15, I grabbed the guitar again playing lead acoustic, my brother played bass and we had a friend who played mandolin.\" His affection for bluegrass led him to Keith Whitley. \"When I heard him sing it helped me bridge over into country music. I started hearing great country songs, songwriters and singers ... and I just fell in love.\"\n\nEncouraged to move to Nashville by a songwriting friend, Pitney was the uncommon arrival who receives early interest from record labels. He signed with Curb and began working on bringing his songs and sound into alignment with his musical vision. One of the lynchpins was connecting with his producer, Tony Brown (George Strait).\n\n\"Instead of trying to put some songs together to come out of my mouth and create an artist with my face, Tony said, 'I want to find out who you are, pull it out of you and put it on tape.' It wasn\u2019t just the way he said it, it was in everything he did. Realizing I can create a record the way I want to and use the musicians I want was an eye-opening experience. We recorded my vocals while I was sitting on a stool and playing guitar at the same time, so it\u2019s a live record in a lot of ways. My hands were untied.\"\n\nAs music lovers become exposed to his music, rousing receptions may be something he'll become accustomed to seeing. But they won't change Mo's core motivation. \"Even if this thing doesn\u2019t go huge, I believe that I can make a decent living playing music,\" he says. \"And I always knew that I could do that. When I was younger, my plan was bluegrass. I used to buy and sell cars, I did body work and I trained bird dogs. I figured I would just kind of piddle around, doing different things around the music.\n\n\"People who have done this for a long time think there's a place for my music, and I hope that's the case. My eyes are set on being successful, but success is not number one for me. If I can make a comfortable living and have a career making music and keep my head on straight, that\u2019s my goal. And I think that I have a great opportunity to do that if I don\u2019t get ahead of myself.\"\n\nAnd that kind of seasoned perspective isn't often heard from someone of his generation. \"I\u2019m a God-fearing man,\" he says. \"I love simple things. I love simplicity in songs because I love simplicity in life. But I\u2019m also very deep, which is weird. I\u2019m a thinker. And I go so deep, a lot of times I just confuse myself and get frustrated, but when I come home and my dog runs and jumps up on my lap, that does something to my spirit. I love to hunt and fish. I love the outdoors. I love my family. I try to live pretty morally square. Pretty clean guy. I\u2019ve got my problems, but I try to stay pretty straight.\"\n\nPerhaps the best expression of how Mo Pitney has created his own definition of country music success is found in \"Behind This Guitar,\" a song by Don Sampson and Phil O'Donnell that may not even make the album. \"People tell me I can\u2019t cut it because the chorus says, 'Behind this guitar there\u2019s just a boy who had a dream in his heart, behind this guitar there\u2019s just a guy that can\u2019t believe he got this far.' And they point out that I haven't gotten anywhere yet, so save it for the second album. But I remember sitting on my bed with the dream of just making music the rest of my life. It wasn\u2019t that I had to be on radio or even make a living doing it. I just loved music. Now I\u2019m on the Opry. I have a record deal. And I\u2019m loving the music that I\u2019m making. I can't believe I got this far!\n\n\"I\u2019m probably just going to cut the song.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam Baldwin LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9283419.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I play my Telecaster.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jill Andrews LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9922068.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Americana, Indie Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The stories of a woman often go untold.

She has collaborated and shared the stage with countless celebrated artists including the Avett Brothers, Langhorne Slim, Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors and the Secret Sisters, and her music has been featured on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, The Good Wife, Nashville, Wynonna Earp and American Idol. Featuring emotional melodies, intimate storytelling and vocals that soar even at a whisper, Thirties is a deviation, it resists contemplating the big, loud questions of the world, and rather, invites listeners to look inward, keeping us closer to home than ever before.\n\nTenderly, hauntingly and without fear, Thirties chronicles Andrews\u2019 journey through a decade rife with both beauty and brutality. She explores the isolation and joy of motherhood, the loss not of a lover, but a partner, the experience of growing older in a world that expects you to stay young forever. With co-producer Lucas Morton and help from friends including Grammy winning songwriting duo Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk, Natlie Hemby and Andrews\u2019 Hush Kids bandmate Peter Groenwald, Thirties is at once profoundly intimate and artfully infectious, evocative of greats Lucinda Williams, Chrissie Hynde and Brandi Carlile.\n\nAndrews lives in Nashville, Tennessee with her children Nico, Falcon, and husband, Jerred.

The\nMomentum Label Group recording artist was raised in the wild of Kodiak, Alaska, and has been making\nher mark in Nashville and country music.\n\nLynae, who is adept at combining deep, vivid, moving country storytelling with the edge of guitar-driven\nrock and the big hooks of pop, is reminiscent of Shania Twain, who was the queen of country-pop during\nthe \u201890s.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fitting since Shania is a big influence,\u201d Lynae says. \u201cI loved her music when I was growing up and\nnow I think about why we loved her records so much. She and Mutt Lange made big sounding albums\nwith memorable melodies, that stick in your head.\u201d\n\nLynae is doing the same with her two new latest cuts, \u201cWhole Lotta Nothin'\u201d and \u201cQuicksand.\u201d The\nformer is a clever, playful and catchy tune, which is the antidote to the unrelenting pace, which is the\nnorm in our society. Singer-songwriter Hannah Bethel hit Lynae and David Myhre (fellow co-writer) with a melody idea and the songsmiths were off and running.\n\n\u201cHannah came up with something that was so cool melodically,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cAnd then we started talking about how busy we are and how it\u2019s just non-stop. I said, \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be great to take a vacation\nand just hang out\u2019 and that set the mood of the song. What it comes down to is that if you can\u2019t take a vacation, then take a three-minute hiatus from your to-do list with this song.\u201d\n\nThe tune became a fan favorite and was included on Apple Music's \"Country A-List\" along with the likes of country superstars Miranda Lambert and Little Big Town.\n\nAnd then there is the gritty and powerful \u201cQuicksand,\u201d which is Lynae\u2019s latest single. The uber catchy tune was written by songwriter and Emerson Drive member Danick Dupelle, who came in and played a little groove on his guitar and Lynae said, \u2018that sounds like quicksand.\u2019 So along with songwriter Patricia Conroy, they played around with some 'oohs' for the melody, then focused on relationships that feel like you're stuck and sinking in quicksand.\n\n\"I think we all have stepped into 'quicksand' at one time or another when it comes to relationships, so we figured, why not try to save someone a little heartache,\" said Lynae.\n\nHowever, Lynae\u2019s career is in anything but quicksand. She is morphing at warped speed as a well-rounded force after recording her eponymous self-titled debut which dropped in April 2014. She has been touring across the country performing with some of country music's most celebrated artists including Keith Urban, The Band Perry, Maddie & Tae, Kelsea Ballerini and many more. She has also performed the National Anthem at several high profile Major League baseball games and ranked among the Top 25 artists spanning all music genres on Macy's iHeart Radio Rising Stars national campaign. Most recently, Lynae was included in CMT's Artist Discovery Campaign, which recognizes emerging artists they feel have promising futures ahead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m evolving,\u201d Lynae says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking bigger picture. For me I\u2019m not just concentrating on the songs. I\u2019m thinking about everything. I\u2019m involved with the production. I\u2019ve been co-producing with Jamie (O'Neal) and I\u2019m focusing on all things sonically. When I\u2019m writing I\u2019m thinking about everything from the background vocals to special effects to how the song will be arranged. I think about the solo parts on a track. I\u2019m learning how to be a well-rounded musician. What I want to make is ear candy without it sounding too busy kind of like how Shania and Mutt Lange did it.\u201d\n\nLynae can\u2019t help but hark back to when Shania ruled the pop and country chart. Lynae waxes about an era when love songs were in vogue, which is a stark contrast in this era, which toasts conspicuous consumption and frivolity.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re starting to miss the \u201890s and early 2000\u2019s,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cThat was when country music had so many stories that touched on deeper parts of life. However, the recent trend is party songs, which have their place. But there\u2019s something about love songs. That\u2019s what I love to write most. Love is something everyone can relate to. If you\u2019ve never been in love, you yearn for it. If you found love, it\u2019s the most amazing thing that has surpassed anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. Or you could have had love and been crushed beyond your wildest imagination. I think it\u2019s time for love songs to return and for ladies to be on top again.\u201d\n\nLynae will be blazing the way with her big black boots and empowering songs. Like her music, Lynae\u2019s fashion is a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. \u201cThe way a performer dresses is another form of expression,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cI have that rocker thing going on but I still incorporate the country. I might wear my boots and then have some fringe to blend country and rock, like my sound.\u201d\n\nUnlike many 20-somethings, Lynae understands the art of live performance and delivers onstage like a grizzled veteran. Lynae engages the audience and is often at her best when living in the moment.\n\n\u201cThe more you prepare for a show, the more spontaneous you can be when you perform,\u201d the sage Lynae said. \u201cWhen you have it all down, you can step outside the box. During a recent show in Seattle a microphone literally fell apart. Instead of losing it up there, I just poked fun at the situation. Everyone laughed. I dealt with what happened and the audience left with a memorable concert moment.\u201d\n\nLynae, who has the composure of a Taylor Swift and the charm of the aforementioned Twain, naturally connects with her fans. \u201cI just love to talk with those who come out to see me,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me being me up there. I think if I\u2019m having fun, it gives the audience permission to have fun. The fun is infectious. For me, it\u2019s about getting real and personal. That way every show is different. I don\u2019t follow the same exact formula every time I get onstage. So, I just embrace the imperfections, love to joke around and do what I can to connect with everyone that comes through the door.\u201d\n\nThe fashionable Lynae is light years from the girl who grew up in Alaska. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a name brand was. I didn\u2019t get the concept of it. I was wearing sweat pants back then but Alaska definitely helped shape who I am. It\u2019s an incredibly creative, independent and wild state. Coming from there has had an impact on my music. I\u2019m all about taking chances and making the best music that I can. I\u2019m not the same person I was when I was growing up in Alaska or even when I made my first album. I\u2019m growing and evolving and so is my music.\u201d", "otherInfo": "I am beyond excited to invite you to my (Virtual) Album Release Party!!

Truthfully, it embodies an ironclad creative bond, familial brotherhood, and a lifelong commitment to fans. At this point, it goes without saying the band means everything (and more) to the Kalamazoo, MI bluegrass mavericks.\n\nSo, with a wink and a smile, they offer up a cleverly titled seventh full-length, All For Money, in 2019.\n\nHoffman dispels the obvious first: \u201cClearly, we aren\u2019t a band all for money. We did it for romantic reasons such as love, catharsis, and because it mattered to us and the listeners. We wanted to have fun with the paradox of the title though. We\u2019re truly blessed and humbled to have our dreams come true and do what we do. However, it would be easy to make decisions based on our needs to eat or the desires of others, but that\u2019s not doing it for love. We love what we do, and we\u2019re grateful for the love we receive in return from the people listening.\u201d\n\nAs time goes on, the guys continue to do things for the \u201cright reasons,\u201d and that mindset resonates louder and louder amongst a growing fan base. A live force of nature renowned for bringing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll showmanship to high-energy bluegrass, the group has sold out hallowed venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the legendary Ryman Auditorium in addition to igniting stages everywhere from Bonnaroo and New Orleans Jazz Festival to Austin City Limits and Outside Lands. Their unpredictable performances remain the stuff of legend attracting diehard devotees who typically travel far and wide to experience multiple gigs. In 2014, If Sorrows Swim bowed at #1 on the Billboard Top Bluegrass Albums Chart, while the 2016 follow-up Shouted, Written Down & Quoted cracked the Top 3. Along the way, they have also earned praise from Billboard, AXS, Westword, and more.\n\nOn All For Money, Greensky once again aimed to progress. This time around, the musicians kept the show top of mind as they composed the music.\n\n\u201cWe have a motto where we want every show to be harder, better, longer, and faster,\u201d admits Hoffman. \u201cWith All For Money, I felt like we were serving the performance more by writing and arranging material in a way we would intend to play it on stage. We tried to incorporate a lot of what we already do live, which is different for us in the studio.\u201d\n\nThey recorded March-May at Echo Mountain Sound in Asheville, NC. In the studio, they worked with longtime friend Dominic John Davis as producer. According to Hoffman, Davis offered a fresh perspective on \u201chow to balance the studio and concerts.\u201d Amplifying the sonic palette, signatures such as dobro tone, bass grooves, and banjo took the spotlight.\n\nThe first single \u201cDo It Alone\u201d feels equally at home on a festival stage as it does blaring through your soundsystem. Backed by a robust groove, the song transforms traditional bluegrass instrumentation into a rich sonic backdrop highlighted by a mandolin awash in a trio of effects as well as rich echoed vocals and emotive lyrics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been trying to write a windows-down rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tune for a while,\u201d explains Hoffman. \u201cI got out an old guitar of mine, re-strung it, and immediately spit the song out. It\u2019s meant to be an anthem. I ask myself, \u2018Why do I do it alone?\u2019 It\u2019s because I\u2019ve got a whole room of thousands singing at the top of their lungs with me. Whenever I write something emotional that might be difficult to sing, I\u2019m reminded of the fact the crowd is there. Hopefully, it\u2019s a reminder for other people as well and we all have something to chant together.\u201d\n\nHot on its heels, the intriguing and irresistible \u201cMurder of Crows\u201d takes flight on kinetic performances as it delivers an emotionally charged message and provocative narrative. \u201cThis is a song that Aaron and I wrote about disconnection, drifting apart, loss, and remorse,\u201d Dave Bruzza reveals. \u201cIt also touches on a cry for help and how it was not heard in time. A friend told me crows had funerals. He explained that farmers used to nail a crow to the fence or barn door to get rid of them eating the crops. Thee birds would gather, pay their respects, and fly off never to\nreturn. It was interesting. I began to think why people disappear in our lives. It came together with the mysterious letter someone received, and it all made sense to turn this into a story.\u201d\n\nAlso originally penned by Bruzza, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Mine Anymore\u201d\u2019 illustrates the group\u2019s virtuosity with a \u201cmetal\u201d spirit. Elsewhere, \u201cWish I Didn\u2019t Know\u201d hinges on a trance-y Mandolin passage that proves instantly hypnotic, and \u201cDo Harm\u201d taps into an upbeat bounce by way of an an off-kilter rhythm. Meanwhile, the title track spirals into psychedelic territory during a head-spinning two-minute midsection before culminating on an important statement.\n\n\u201cIt feels liberating to be honest about it,\u201d he remarks. \u201cWith the title track, we were asking more of the listeners than we ever have, but the line \u2018If you need a voice, I\u2019m yours friend\u2019 is meant for them.\u201d\n\nIn the end, all the right reasons continue to drive Greensky Bluegrass.\n\n\u201cAs songwriters and musicians, we have a need for people to be on board, and we\u2019re not just regurgitating the same shit,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing ourselves every time. I hope they want to listen to the record and hear the songs live. I hope they know we\u2019re doing this for us and them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/lfot-summer-camp-weekend-pass"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mark Joseph LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8787909.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "American Soul, Jazz Blues, Funk, Blue-eyed Soul, Gospel, Reggae, Jam Bands, Bluegrass, Jazz, Jazz Fusion, Rock, Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Minneapolis, Minnesota\u2019s Mark Joseph & The American Soul are modern day proof of what genuine creative talent, exceedingly hard-work, and decades of dedication to one\u2019s craft can bring to the world.

Shorter has recorded dozens of albums as a leader, and appeared on dozens more with others. Many of his compositions have become standards.\n\nShorter was born in Newark, New Jersey, and attended Newark Arts High School. He was encouraged by his father to take up the saxophone as a teenager (his brother Alan became a trumpeter). After graduating from New York University in 1956 Shorter spent two years in the US Army, during which time he played briefly with Horace Silver, and after his discharge from the army with Maynard Ferguson.\n\nIn 1959 Shorter joined Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers. He stayed with Blakey for five years, and eventually became musical director for the group. In 1964, Miles Davis persuaded Shorter to leave Blakey and join the Miles Davis Quintet alongside Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. Davis had been searching for a saxophonist to replace John Coltrane for some time, and the new quintet is considered by many to have been Davis's strongest working group. Shorter composed extensively for Davis (\"Prince of Darkness\", \"ESP\", \"Footprints\", \"Sanctuary\", and many others; on some albums he provided half of the compositions).\n\nHerbie Hancock had this to say of Shorter's tenure in the group: \"The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. He still is a master. Wayne was one of the few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed.\" Davis said: \"Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, write the parts for everybody just as he wants them to sound. He also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste.\"\n\nSimultaneously with his time in the Miles Davis quintet, Shorter recorded several albums for Blue Note Records, featuring almost exclusively his own compositions. He also recorded occasionally as a sideman (again, mainly for Blue Note) with Donald Byrd, McCoy Tyner, Grachan Moncur III, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, and band mates Hancock and Williams. Until 1968 he played tenor saxophone exclusively; by the early 1970s, however, he chiefly played soprano saxophone.\n\nShorter remained in Davis's band after the breakup of the quintet in 1968, playing on early jazz fusion recordings including In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew (both 1969). His last live dates and studio recordings with Davis were in 1970.\n\nIn 1970, along with keyboardist Joe Zawinul (also a veteran of the Miles Davis group), Shorter formed Weather Report. Other original members were bassist Miroslav Vitous, percussionist Airto Moreira, and drummer Alphonse Mouzon. Shorter and Zawinul co-led the group until late 1985 with a variety of other musicians, and separately wrote most of Weather Report's material. Shorter also recorded critically acclaimed albums as leader, notably Native Dancer, which featured Brazilian composer and vocalist Milton Nascimento, and Atlantis.\n\nAfter leaving Weather Report, Shorter continued to record and lead groups in jazz fusion styles, and contributed to several albums by Joni Mitchell. He has also maintained an occasional working relationship with Herbie Hancock, including appearances on several of Hancock's albums, the VSOP band (essentially a revival of the 1960s Miles Davis quintet with Freddie Hubbard substituting for Davis), and a tribute album recorded shortly after Davis's death with Hancock, Carter, Williams and Wallace Roney.\n\nShorter formed his current band in 2000, the first permanent acoustic group under his leadership. The quartet is composed of pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade. Two albums of live recordings featuring this quartet have been released (Footprints Live (2001) and Beyond the Sound Barrier (2005)). The quartet has received great acclaim from fans and critics, and the musicians have come to consider themselves family on and off stage. Shorter's 2003 album Alegria received a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album; it features the quartet with a host of other musicians, including pianist Brad Mehldau, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and former Weather Report percussionist Alex Acu\u00f1a.\n\nShorter's wife Ana Maria and their niece Dalila were both killed on TWA Flight 800 in 1996, and he married Carolina Dos Santos, a close friend of Ana Maria, in 1999.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee.

John began composing and performing at age 12. At age 15, he began to play the acoustic bass and at age 16 began the piano. He quickly moved from playing soul and rock to blues, jazz and classical music. His eclectic tastes caused him to explore all types of music as a player and a composer. John studied classical bass at San Francisco State University and Long Beach State University. In 1980, he continued his career in Los Angeles as a studio musician and a jazz artist. MVP As a studio musician, John has played on countless albums with artists such as B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Michael Brecker, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Was Not Was, Dave Grusin, Natalie Cole, Bon Jovi, Queen Latifah, Sting, and Carly Simon. In 1986, John was voted by his peers in the studios as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences MVP (Most Valuable Player) on acoustic bass. As a performer, he has played throughout the world with his own band, and with jazz luminaries Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Stan Getz, Wynton Marsalis, Joshua Redman, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Freddie Hubbard, Tony Williams, Hubert Laws, Mulgrew Miller, James Williams, and scores of others. Some of the many pop and Brazilian artists he has played with include Sting, Aaron Neville, Natalie Cole, Carole King, Milton Nascimiento, Astrud and Joao Gilberto, Airto and Flora Purim, Ivan Lins, Joao Bosco and Dori Caymmi. John has worked with film composers Jerry Goldsmith, Ry Cooder, James Newton Howard, Dave Grusin, Henry Mancini, John Williams, Mark Isham, Michel Columbier, Carter Burwell, and Howard Shore. AT THE FOREFRONT Since 1985, his association with Chick Corea has brought him worldwide acclaim and put him at the forefront of the jazz world. His many recordings with Chick Corea's Elektric Band and Akoustic Band, his six solo recordings for GRP Records and his subsequent recordings have brought him two Grammy Awards (one for playing and one for composing) and over fifteen Grammy nominations. In addition, his first solo recording, JOHN PATITUCCI, went to number one on the Billboard Jazz charts. He arranged and produced his own records as well as those of other artists. In1996, he signed with Concord Jazz and has released five records on their label: One More Angel, Now, Imprint, Communion and Songs, Stories and Spirituals. The two most recent recordings were nominated for Grammy Awards in the composition category. John has won many magazine polls for his electric and acoustic bass playing, including Best Jazz Bassist in Guitar Player Magazine's 1992, 1994 and 1995 Readers' Poll and Best Jazz Bassist in Bass Player Magazine's 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 Readers' Poll.

John is also regularly involved with The Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz and has taught at the Betty Carter Jazz Ahead program in Washington, D. C. in 2000. INTO XXI CENTURY In 2002, John began teaching at The City College of New York upon the retirement of Ron Carter from his teaching duties there. In 2003, John was appointed Associate Professor of Jazz Studies at City College. After exploring many different writing styles on his own records and those of Chick Corea's, John continues to compose for many mediums. In 1994 he was commissioned to write a piece for six-string electric bass and string orchestra for the Italian chamber orchestra Suono e Oltre in Pescara, Italy. With John as soloist, the piece was performed in March of 1995 in Italy and in August of 1995 with the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in Tokyo. John was also commissioned to write a piece for the Turtle Island String Quartet, a group fluent in both classical and jazz music. Since moving back to the New York area in 1996, John has continued to work with his own group, as well as many others. He has toured the world with his group, The John Patitucci Quartet. He was the featured Jazz Bassist at the 1999 International Society of Bassists convention. In 1998, John was a part of the Roy Haynes Trio, along with Danilo Perez on piano. This trio recorded a critically acclaimed album for Verve Records and has toured throughout the world. In the Fall of 2001, John toured the United States as member of an all-star quintet called Directions in Music led by Herbie Hancock and featuring Michael Brecker, Roy Hargrove and Brian Blade.

His string quartet composition was performed at Merkin Hall alongside works by composers John Corigliano and David del Tredici. In January 2004, the Wayne Shorter Quartet played with the Orchestra de Lyon in Paris under the direction of the talented David Robertson (new musical director of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra) for a week of concerts in various formations.

Having toured the US, Canada, and Europe constantly since April 2006, HuDost has grown and expanded, travelled rocky and glorious terrain and marveled at all they can learn and explore.

A longtime sailor, Legg also notes that \u201ca lot of my childhood memories are of me and my dad on this little tiny boat, cruising around the New England coast. I spent countless hours just sailing and listening to music, and the feeling of that experience has stayed with me really heavily over the years.\u201d Throughout the album, Goldroom reveals his deep-rooted affinity with the ocean by sculpting expansive arrangements and instilling each song with a serene yet kinetic energy.\n\nThat energy\u2019s partly sourced from Goldroom\u2019s ingenuity in interlacing live guitar, bass, and percussion into electronic soundscapes to form a sound both forward-pushing and timeless. On West of the West, he further shapes that glossy but groove-heavy sound by tapping into sensibilities of early French house music. \u201cI don\u2019t feel all that influenced by producers on a day-to-day basis\u2014songwriting is what\u2019s important to me, so I\u2019m usually thinking about guys like Tom Petty or Curtis Mayfield\u2014but there\u2019s an innocence to what producers like Daft Punk and Alan Braxe do that appeals to me,\u201d says Legg. And just as those artists show an intense fascination with the pop landscape of the early \u201980s, Goldroom steeps West of the West in its own nostalgia. \u201cI\u2019ve always used music as an escapist device, as a way to try to get back to that feeling of when you were younger and everything was a little more pure and uncomplicated,\u201d he points out.\n\nOn the album-opening \u201cSilhouette,\u201d for instance, Goldroom brilliantly channels the breezy and bass-powered feel of classic French touch music. Slow-building and warmly intimate, the song bittersweetly muses on \u201cwhat it means to be far away from someone you love and feeling like part of you is missing without them,\u201d as Legg explains.\n\nFrom start to finish West of the West sustains that dreamy melancholy, a mood informed by Legg\u2019s solo touring as a DJ in recent years. \u201cBeing alone on the road for long stretches of time is a pretty unique experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s this dual thing of loving that lifestyle of constantly being in motion, but also missing my family and my friends and feeling pulled back home. That\u2019s definitely something I kept coming back to as I was writing for this record.\u201d Trading off vocals with Irish singer/songwriter Rooty throughout West of the West, Goldroom brings a nuanced emotionality to songs like \u201cBack to You\u201d (a sweetly shimmering feel-good track), \u201cLying to You\u201d (a darkly propulsive number with all the cinematic intensity of an \u201980s pop gem), and \u201cRetrograde\u201d (a gorgeously urgent anthem driven by Rooty\u2019s powerful vocal performance).\n\nIn creating West of the West, Goldroom aimed to \u201cdig really deep and come up with something more honest and meaningful than what you usually see in dance music.\u201d Aided by his graceful grasp of songcraft, that honesty manifests itself in a spirited vitality also abundant in Goldroom\u2019s energetic live show. (Featuring a full band setup, the Goldroom live set finds Legg backed by a bassist, drummer, and fellow singer as he alternates between guitar and keys.) \u201cIt\u2019s a lot different from older Goldroom stuff, where my primary concern was whether or not the song was going to work on a dance floor,\u201d Legg adds in reflecting on West of the West.\n\nDebuting with the Angeles EP in 2011, Goldroom emerged soon after the dissolution of Legg\u2019s former band NightWaves. \u201cI\u2019d been writing all these songs but had no outlet for them, so people suggested I start a solo thing,\u201d recalls Legg, who borrowed the name Goldroom from a dive bar in Echo Park (\u201ca good place to get drunk and find answers to all of life\u2019s hardest questions\u201d). Though Goldroom was born from his then-burgeoning infatuation with the electronic world, the project drew closely from Legg\u2019s near-lifelong experience in making music. Raised in Wellesley, Massachusetts, he learned to play cello and guitar as a child and soon started writing his own songs and self-recording on a four-track. At age 15 he had a major musical awakening while teaching sailing on Cape Cod, where a group of college kids turned him on to the \u201960s/\u201970s rock and folk artists who would eventually guide his own songwriting. After heading off to study at the University of Southern California, Legg discovered Air, Daft Punk, and other electronic artists whose music \u201cmade me feel things I didn\u2019t know that I could feel.\u201d He then began his journey toward crafting boldly inventive electronic music with a classic-pop songwriting structure at its core.\n\nFor Goldroom, the main thrill of West of the West is his success in \u201cmaking a record where I could sit down with an acoustic guitar, play the album all the way through, and still make it work.\u201d But while each song is strong enough to stand unadorned, West of the West\u2019s lush and luminous production ultimately lends the album an even greater emotional depth. \u201cThere\u2019s something really incredible about beautiful chords being played using a stack of nicely tuned synthesizers,\u201d Legg says in discussing his passion for electronic music. \u201cAnd with a drum machine, you can make a kick-drum sound that\u2019s more impactful than any real kick drum. There\u2019s a whole world out there with electronic music, and the thing that gets me most excited as a musician is finding new ways to paint with those palettes while still telling a very human story.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join us for this episode of Music Lives ON, an on-going series that will happen every Friday night on LiveXLive.

With Jazz as the anchoring foundation, P\u00e9rez\u2019s Global Jazz music is a blend of Panamanian roots, Latin American folk music, West African rhythms, European impressionism \u2013 promoting music as a borderless and multidimensional bridge between all people.\n\nBorn in Panama in 1965, P\u00e9rez started his musical studies when he was three years old with his father, a bandleader and singer. By age 10, he was studying the European classical piano repertoire at the National Conservatory in Panama. After receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics in Panama, he studied jazz composition at the prestigious Berklee College of Music. While still a student, he performed with Jon Hendricks, Terence Blanchard, Slide Hampton, Claudio Roditi and Paquito D\u2019Rivera. Quickly established as a young master, he soon toured and/or recorded with artists such as Dizzy Gillespie United Nations Orchestra from 1989-1992, Jack DeJohnette, Steve Lacy, Lee Konitz, Charlie Haden, Michael Brecker, Joe Lovano, Tito Puente, Wynton Marsalis, Tom Harrell, Gary Burton, and Roy Haynes.\n\nIn 1993, P\u00e9rez turned his focus to his own ensembles and recording projects, releasing several albums as a leader, earning Grammy\u00ae and Latin Grammy\u00ae nominations for Central Avenue (1998), Motherland (2000), Across The Crystal Sea (2008), and Providencia (2010). In 1996, he was signed by producer Tommy Lipuma to join the Impulse label and recorded Panamonk, a tribute to Thelonious Monk which according to DownBeat magazine is one of the most important piano albums in the history of jazz. P\u00e9rez\u2019s album Central Avenue, featured mejoranera music (a style of Panamanian folklore singing) and was chosen as one of the 10 best recordings across genres by TIME Magazine in 1998. A collaboration between P\u00e9rez and the prolific composer and arranger Claus Ogerman, 2008\u2019s Across The Crystal Sea was praised by The Guardian as, \u201cSo ultra-smooth it achieves something like a state of grace.\u201d Ogerman said, \u201cThis is a record I wanted to make before I leave the planet.\u201d P\u00e9rez made his Mack Avenue Records debut in 2010 with the release of Providencia. The album was nominated for a 2011 Grammy\u00ae Award in the category of Best Instrumental Jazz Album.\n\nP\u00e9rez joined the Wayne Shorter Quartet in 2010 with John Patitucci and Brian Blade. This latest iteration from Shorter has been known as a unique and predominant force in improvisational music both at their historic live performances and on several recordings. In 2018 Blue Note records released the highly anticipated EMANON from the Wayne Shorter Quartet which won a Grammy\u00ae in the category of Best Jazz Instrumental album in 2019.\n\nFor several years P\u00e9rez has also been touring with his trio \u2013 featuring Ben Street and Adam Cruz \u2013 and with Children of the Light, a collaboration with fellow Wayne Shorter Quartet members John Patitucci and Brian Blade. Mack Avenue released the Children of the Light album in 2015 to great critical acclaim. P\u00e9rez\u2019s current touring project, the Global Messengers, spreads the idea that music can serve as a natural remedy to unfortunate situations, providing an uplifting message, connection, and common ground. The ensemble features musicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, coming together to build community through music.\n\nAs a composer, P\u00e9rez has been commissioned by The Lincoln Center, Chicago Jazz Festival, and Imani Winds Quintet, among others. His octet for members of the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela was commissioned by Carnegie Hall. In 2014, the Banff Centre commissioned P\u00e9rez to write a piano quintet for the Cecilia String Quartet titled \"Camino de Cruces\" and he also composed the music for the Museum of Biodiversity in Panama, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry. In 2015, P\u00e9rez premiered another two new compositions: \u201cExpeditions \u2013 Panamania 2015\u201d was premiered at the Panamerican games in Toronto and his \u201cDetroit World Suite \u2013 La Leyenda de Bayano\u201d was premiered at the Detroit Jazz Festival.

He is a recipient of the United States Fellowship 2018, and the 2009 Smithsonian Legacy Award. He currently serves as UNESCO Artist for Peace, Cultural Ambassador to the Republic of Panama, Founder and Artistic Director of the Panama Jazz Festival, and the Berklee Global Jazz Institute in Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music.", "otherInfo": "On Friday, May 22, SFJAZZ presents the first of a four-part celebration of legendary saxophonist Wayne Shorter featuring the world premiere of a 2019 all-star tribute concert at the SFJAZZ Center, featuring Kamasi Washington, Terrace Martin, Danilo P\u00e9rez, John Patitucci, and Brian Blade.

He\u2019s stood on stages and tabletops, under the lights and in dimly lit corners, in large cities, small towns, a couple of state fairs, and one beauty pageant. He\u2019s played four hour shows single-handedly, and traded half-hour sets at a weekly house gig at a bar in Guatemala City with \u201csome guy named Luis, who sang songs like \u2018My Way\u2019 in Spanish.

A fan on Jim\u2019s CDBaby page summed it up this way:\n\u201cJim plays because he loves music. He plays with the same passion whether he is playing for thousands or a few fans.

The vocal performance by band co-founder Serena Pryne was so gut-wrenching and so emotionally draining, mining the very depths of her soul that she practically collapsed into the arms of superstar producer GGGarth Richardson when it was over. That vocal take and the similarly powerhouse performances from her bandmates, came to be the template and benchmark for the rest of the album. \u201cI knew it was a powerful song with a lot of emotion behind it and I was a little intimidated to record it\u201d said Pryne. \u201cHe let me do my thing and just pour everything I had into the microphone. He said I would know when I was done.\u201d From that moment on, that song set the tone for the rest of the record. \u201cI don\u2019t know if GGGarth knew it ahead of time and planned it with that song, because he would always reference Don\u2019t Ask if we were struggling at any other moment. He set the entire tone based on that track,\u201d said guitarist and band co-founder Nick Lesyk. The entirety of Windows and Stones is just as creatively, spiritually and emotionally intense and takes the listener on an aural and experiential journey that they won\u2019t soon forget. This too is emblematic of The Mandevilles\u2019 \u2018leave it all on the floor\u2019 approach to writing, recording and especially performing the music live. And it\u2019s music that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward and unpretentious in its approach and delivery. No studio trickery, experimental flights of fancy or self-indulgence - just rock and roll. \u201cBeing a Canadian, I think it\u2019s funny that I describe it as American rock and roll. I say that because it\u2019s reminiscent of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen - all rolled into one. Our music comes from the same place.\u201d said Lesyk. Pryne and Lesyk are the creative nucleus of The Mandevilles and have been musical partners for nearly 15 years, although both bring significantly different musical influences to the table. \u201cSerena\u2019s influences are steeped more in the roots of rock and roll whereas mine are a little more contemporary. But there are a lot of commonalities: we love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. And then there are newer songwriters like Ryan Adams and Jason Isbell,\u201d said Lesyk. As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

To that end, she\u2019s built her engaging stage presence on the larger-than-life pop personas of her childhood and based her commanding pop country vocals on iconic female country artists, including Hillary Scott, Carrie Underwood and Sara Evans.\n\nAt around age 20, Tiffany knew she wanted to pursue a career in music. While earning a political science degree, she spent her free time laying impressive groundwork for a future career as an artist. She toured the West Coast extensively, performing for thousands at shows and festivals.\n\nThough immensely grateful for the tremendous opportunities she was given on the West Coast, Tiffany always knew Nashville was where she needed to be to take the next step in her career.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006.

But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans.

However, his father--having been one of the few journalists in India to cover the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and 70s-- was immensely fond of Black artistic expression, and as such, Zeshan grew up with the sounds of his father\u2019s blues, soul and r&b collection as well. Additionally, his mother--a social worker at the notorious Cook County Hospital on Chicago\u2019s West Side--imbibed him with a sensitivity and awareness towards the plight of disenfranchised inner-city minorities.\n\nEarly on in his adolescence, Zeshan\u2019s natural aptitude for music was discovered and to that end, while excelling in band, orchestra and choral programs, he felt most at home in being the lead soloist of his school\u2019s gospel choir. He thus decided it best to pursue the study of music in college and his vocal talents earned him a full scholarship at Northwestern University\u2019s Bienen School of Music.\n\nHowever, after matriculating through the conservatory and singing for several opera companies, Zeshan soon realized that classical music was just not his thing, as he felt trapped in a world of archaic traditions, outdated performance practices and a power structure that primarily catered to people of privilege and means. He decided to return to his roots.\n\nAnd in doing so, he has created an entirely new, original genre of music that is his very own--Brown Skinned Soul. Blending the hard-driving grooves and horn heavy sounds of late 60s/ early 70s American soul with the angsty scats and vocal stylings of early Indo-Pakistani film/folk tunes, Zeshan\u2019s live embodiment of brown skinned soul has garnered him sold out performances at the Apollo, Cobo Arena (Detroit), Excel London, Millennium Park (Chicago), Coke Studio\u2019s Jaipur Literature Fest, as well as the privilege of opening for acts like Mos Def, A Tribe Called Quest, Rakim, Aasif Mandvi and Rev. Jesse Jackson.\n\nA self-proclaimed patriot, in 2015, Zeshan opened for the Carter Foundation in Detroit with a performance of the US national anthem for which Former President Jimmy Carter emphatically stated, \u201cI have never heard a more beautiful rendition of the Star Spangled Banner than the one we just heard\u201d. This acclaimed performance led to the ultimate honor for Zeshan--an invitation from President Obama to perform at the White House for the inaugural Eid celebration in 2016.\n\nThese accolades landed Zeshan a record deal with Chicago label Minty Fresh, and the label is slated to release his debut solo album in April of 2017. Produced by Lester Snell---the legendary arranger for Isaac Hayes, Al Green\u2019s, Sam & Dave and Mavis Staples of Stax Records Fame--the album is a mixtape of Zeshan\u2019s originals and lesser known 1960s and 70s deep soul gems. Recorded in Memphis with a wrecking crew of Stax Records\u2019 original sidemen at Ardent Studios, Zeshan pours his heart out in 10 tracks and 3 languages-- English, Urdu and Punjabi. The album is a wide array of tempestuous soul arias, sentimental ballads, urban love dramas, Memphis blues, upbeat existentialism and last but certainly not least, a civil rights anthem. These selections are characterized by hard grooves, sumptuously delicate strings, riveting horns and with an idiomatically Indian feel-- replete with a blaring tanpura and harmonium.\n\nFloating above it all are Zeshan\u2019s powerfully mellifluous vocals as he narrates (through the prism of an immigrant) tales of instability, ambiguity, loss, injustice, unrequited love, urban despair and youthful ecstasy. Although Zeshan is no immigrant himself, he is privy to that narrative through his parents and his community and thus, he has seen and lived it firsthand.\n\nAnd with with the way things are these days, it is a narrative that perhaps all of America needs to hear.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nina Baumer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368288.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop, R&b", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chicago-born and Australian-raised, 22-year-old singer-songwriter Nina Baumer developed her love for music and songwriting from a young age.

His subjects fall somewhere in between old cult movies from the turn of the century to vintage Americana \u2014 between John Wayne and Ed Wood. These subjects in any other writer\u2019s care may not coalesce as seamlessly as they do in the hands of Pickard, who ties them together with wit, passion and heart, most recently on display in the Thunderbird Winos\u2019 third record, Heavy on the Heart.\n\nThe album's cover consists of Lichtenstein-inspired art with a mustard bottle labeled with a heart squirting mustard onto a floating hot dog on the backdrop of outer space. The mustard and the hot dog are imbued with a sense of abject silliness but also sustain a deeper meaning.\n\n\u201cWell, when we named the record Heavy on the Heart, I meant it in the same way you would describe to a hot dog vendor that you wanted him to go heavy on the mustard \u2026 and the mustard\u2019s gotta go on something, I guess,\u201d Pickard explains. \u201cI guess hot dogs are pretty heavy on your heart, too,\u201d he adds, \u201cand I figured a hamburger floating in space would just be too normal.\u201d\n\nThe hot dog-mustard motif shows the dichotomy of Pickard, and this album in particular. It embraces both the ridiculous and the serious earnestly and in equal measure.\n\nPickard has been playing in the Dallas music community since the days when live music abounded on Lower Greenville, when people could flock to outdoor graffiti galleries such as the trestle bridge by Flagpole Hill or the Good-Latimer tunnel in Deep Ellum. (Look it up, it was magnificent!) In a way, you could say that Pickard grew with the city, or grew as the city changed. In one of the album's slower tracks, \"Light Rail,\" he laments over soaring pedal steel guitar the city's drive toward the future and its proclivity to occasionally barrel through its past, and past art, in the process: \u201cThe map\u2019s always changing / The roads aren\u2019t the same / tunnels full of dirt / buried in the name of a light rail train.\u201d\n\nWith Pickard, such sentimentality is not in combat but balanced with such off-the-wall tracks as the opener to the album, \u201cUFB,\u201d which \u2014 of course \u2014 stands for \u201cUnidentified Flying Banana.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had seen this documentary about UFOs years ago where a guy was talking about seeing one and saying that it looked 'just like a big ol\u2019 banana\u2019 and then when I was driving back to town from Louisiana one day the song sort of wrote itself.\u201d\n\nThe subject matter alone makes this song easily one of the oddest to come out of Dallas in recent memory. This is reinforced by the music, which recalls the pulp of a detective novel with a hint of old Reverend Horton Heat.\n\n\u201cI feel like with my first record it was a lot of polish and less substance and the second was almost the opposite. This one\u2019s in the middle and a lot of that is because I have my band together now; it\u2019s road-tested,\u201d Pickard says.\n\nThe mixture of polish and substance is maybe most apparent on the title track \u201cHeavy on the Heart,\u201d which falls as the album\u2019s only solo acoustic performance. A sparse chorus reminiscent of Tom Petty reflects the resignation one feels when considering the ills of this world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heavy on the heart\u2026\u201d Pickard writes as the music fades to silence. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\nThe track's sparse acoustic feel is almost by necessity and not by design.\n\n\u201cThat song was actually written after we finished tracking this record as sort of an afterthought,\" Pickard says. \"I\u2019ve noticed that whenever I record an album, I\u2019ll write a perfect song right after, just too late to put it on, but this time we were able to get it on there.\u201d\n\nLike many albums, Heavy on the Heart could be said to be a culmination of its influences. As with the Petty-inspired title track, there's the Dwight Yoakam-inspired song \u201cMississippi Girl\u201d (which could have easily been the record\u2019s first radio single if not for its profanity-laden splendor \u2014 if only Pickard could go back to the studio, re-record and \u201cafford to take out the \u2018fucks\u2019\u201d) and the Bob Wills-inspired Texas swing song \u201cTexas Heaven.\u201d\n\nThe way Pickard lauds his predecessors is most perfectly represented in the culminatory \u201cChicken and Jesus,\u201d where he ties all of these forefathers together with a series of this-or-thats. Pickard either needs \u201cJesus or Otis [Redding],\u201d \u201cVision or Jim [Morrison],\u201d \u201cBreakfast or Elvis.\u201d\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure. After this record, the world and, more importantly, Dallas, needs more of Justin Pickard and the Thunderbird Winos.\n\n-Jamie Vahala / Dallas Observer / March 19, 2020", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ghastly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9027199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Doesnt Matter", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "sup im the ghost kid.", "otherInfo": "Twitch Live Stream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Unauthorized Rolling Stones ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10391002.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Tribute Band", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Their show holds in reverence many legends of the classic rock years, while maintaining their Rolling Stones core.

However, his father--having been one of the few journalists in India to cover the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and 70s-- was immensely fond of Black artistic expression, and as such, Zeshan grew up with the sounds of his father\u2019s blues, soul and r&b collection as well. Additionally, his mother--a social worker at the notorious Cook County Hospital on Chicago\u2019s West Side--imbibed him with a sensitivity and awareness towards the plight of disenfranchised inner-city minorities.\n\nEarly on in his adolescence, Zeshan\u2019s natural aptitude for music was discovered and to that end, while excelling in band, orchestra and choral programs, he felt most at home in being the lead soloist of his school\u2019s gospel choir. He thus decided it best to pursue the study of music in college and his vocal talents earned him a full scholarship at Northwestern University\u2019s Bienen School of Music.\n\nHowever, after matriculating through the conservatory and singing for several opera companies, Zeshan soon realized that classical music was just not his thing, as he felt trapped in a world of archaic traditions, outdated performance practices and a power structure that primarily catered to people of privilege and means. He decided to return to his roots.\n\nAnd in doing so, he has created an entirely new, original genre of music that is his very own--Brown Skinned Soul. Blending the hard-driving grooves and horn heavy sounds of late 60s/ early 70s American soul with the angsty scats and vocal stylings of early Indo-Pakistani film/folk tunes, Zeshan\u2019s live embodiment of brown skinned soul has garnered him sold out performances at the Apollo, Cobo Arena (Detroit), Excel London, Millennium Park (Chicago), Coke Studio\u2019s Jaipur Literature Fest, as well as the privilege of opening for acts like Mos Def, A Tribe Called Quest, Rakim, Aasif Mandvi and Rev. Jesse Jackson.\n\nA self-proclaimed patriot, in 2015, Zeshan opened for the Carter Foundation in Detroit with a performance of the US national anthem for which Former President Jimmy Carter emphatically stated, \u201cI have never heard a more beautiful rendition of the Star Spangled Banner than the one we just heard\u201d. This acclaimed performance led to the ultimate honor for Zeshan--an invitation from President Obama to perform at the White House for the inaugural Eid celebration in 2016.\n\nThese accolades landed Zeshan a record deal with Chicago label Minty Fresh, and the label is slated to release his debut solo album in April of 2017. Produced by Lester Snell---the legendary arranger for Isaac Hayes, Al Green\u2019s, Sam & Dave and Mavis Staples of Stax Records Fame--the album is a mixtape of Zeshan\u2019s originals and lesser known 1960s and 70s deep soul gems. Recorded in Memphis with a wrecking crew of Stax Records\u2019 original sidemen at Ardent Studios, Zeshan pours his heart out in 10 tracks and 3 languages-- English, Urdu and Punjabi. The album is a wide array of tempestuous soul arias, sentimental ballads, urban love dramas, Memphis blues, upbeat existentialism and last but certainly not least, a civil rights anthem. These selections are characterized by hard grooves, sumptuously delicate strings, riveting horns and with an idiomatically Indian feel-- replete with a blaring tanpura and harmonium.\n\nFloating above it all are Zeshan\u2019s powerfully mellifluous vocals as he narrates (through the prism of an immigrant) tales of instability, ambiguity, loss, injustice, unrequited love, urban despair and youthful ecstasy. Although Zeshan is no immigrant himself, he is privy to that narrative through his parents and his community and thus, he has seen and lived it firsthand.\n\nAnd with with the way things are these days, it is a narrative that perhaps all of America needs to hear.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KICKFLIP CHIP ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9304780.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Deep House, Rap, Bass, Dance Pop, Electronic, Trap, Hip Hop, Electro Pop, House, Electro House", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Don't Come if You Don't Want to Dance.", "otherInfo": "This is going to be a good, ol-fashioned, EDM Festival Main Stage/Vegas Style Party!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Albert Castiglia ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CantStopTheBlues"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jethro&Flash ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389415.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop Rock, Dance Pop, Electronic, Poprock, Edm, Pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jethro and Flash is a musical duo from the Bay Area, San Francisco.

Very quickly he progressed to the point where he wanted an electric guitar. After hearing \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d on the radio the rest was history. As a young teenager, Tolkki practically slept with his guitar and it was not uncommon for him to practice 8 hours a day. He was also playing in some local bands but in 1984 got a phonecall from the Stratovarius camp asking him to join the band. Stratovarius soared to great heights becoming the leading pioneers in progressive power metal. This monumental achievement included 7 world tours, 3 consecutive gold discs in Finland and selling almost 3 million records.\n\nThe recent break up of Stratovarius came about because Tolkki felt that the relationships in the band very very badly contaminated and also because everything that was to be said with that band with those members had already been said and to continue would be simply repeating the same form. He also wanted to be able to concentrate on other things, explaining that:\u201cThere\u2019s just a time for everything in life and Stratovarius came to the end of a road and there was nowhere to go anymore\u201d.

On the other hand I can do a production of a dance artist, or a metal artist. Or anyone who I think is real and has it. I rarely do productions outside of my own production company anymore. I am really into finding new talents and developing a project together with an artist, while using enough time for it. Because time is gold in music.

He\u2019s a platinum-selling artist, he\u2019s topped the charts worldwide as the producer behind Reel 2 Real\u2019s hit \u201cI Like To Move It\u201d (used in both Madagascar movies, reaching millions of viewers worldwide and covered by Will I Am in Madagascar 2) and he\u2019s been responsible for a bewildering array of dance-floor tracks including \u2018Reach\u2019, \u2018Believe\u2019, \u2018Do What You Want\u2019 and \u2018I Feel Love\u2019 - under pseudonyms including Ministers De La Funk, The Dronez (with Harry \u2018Choo Choo\u2019 Romero and Jose Nunez) and Li\u2019l Mo Ying Yang. He\u2019s remixed everyone from Whitney Houston to Basement Jaxx and continues to run the legendary Subliminal Records house music empire. On his debut album he collaborated with Puff Daddy and Boy George alike.\n\nFor over a decade now, Erick has remained one of the most in-demand and instantly recognizable DJs in the world. From the instant success of his weekly \u2018Sessions\u2019 parties in New York, to hosting events like the annual road-blocking Subliminal Sessions parties in Miami at Winter Music Conference, to his coveted residency at Ministry of Sound (he\u2019s still one of the only American DJs to ever hold one) and of course his now legendary Subliminal Sessions parties at Pacha Ibiza, Morillo just doesn\u2019t stop. His non-stop DJing schedule at one point saw him straddling the globe playing up to a whopping 30 gigs a month, particularly in the summer months where he\u2019ll play from Rome and Mykonos to London. He\u2019s also become a familiar television personality through his appearances on MTV and MTV Ibiza two years in a row whilst starring in a seven part series for UK TV station Channel 4.\n\nRaised in Colombia, then New Jersey, Erick was weaned on a musical diet of Latin rhythms, reggae and hip-hop. He started DJing at the age of 11 and after securing himself DJ sets at several local gigs decided to take a studio engineering course at the local Centre of Media Arts. He was soon inducted into the house fraternity through his friend Marc Anthony (the Salsa King), whilst he was working with the now legendary Louie Vega and Kenny \u201cDope\u201d Gonzalez on \u201cRide On The Rhythm\u201d. \u201cLouie\u2019s watched out for me since the beginning,\u201d he says of the Masters At Work legend. One minor detail: in the booth at Pacha last time they played together was a certain supermodel called Naomi Campbell and beside her was one of Erick\u2019s musical heroes, the legendary Quincy Jones. \u201cCan you believe it? Quincy Jones came to my party,\u201d he says, still in shock. \u201cWhen we saw him there, Louie and I decided to play a bunch of his classics, like Michael Jackson\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Til You Get Enough\u2019. He told me he loved my bass lines,\u201d smiles Erick. \u201cOne of the proudest days in my life.\u201d\n\nIn 1997, after spending almost a year of meticulously planning everything from logos to packaging, Morillo took it that one step further and launched Subliminal Records with his production partners Harry Romero and Jose Nunez. Guided by Morillo\u2019s ear and studio presence, the brand has gone on to become synonymous with a funk-fuelled, soulful house sound. And in 2004 Erick released his first artist album worldwide, entitled \u201cMy World\u201d it featured heavyweight collaborations from the likes of Puff Daddy, DJ Rap, Boy George and even a reunion with the Mad Stuntman. The lead single \u2018Break Down The Doors\u2019 featured The Audio Bullys, and in the years that followed, further singles and club tracks followed. After \u2018Live Your Life\u2019 and \u2018Stronger\u2019 came Erick\u2019s collaboration with Skin and Eddie Thonieck, \u201cIf This Ain\u2019t Love\u201d, quickly followed by \u2018Elephant\u2019 featuring Alexandra Burke, a Top 5 UK smash. The global touring continued, as did his dominance at clubs from Pacha Ibiza and Ministry Of Sound in London.\n\nAfter a well-documented break from the scene, Morillo returned to his spiritual home of Ibiza in 2014. But unlike previous seasons, he only took on one show, at Space: \u201cI decided to take a step back and I really got to see the industry changing. I did one party at Space for their 25th birthday, two sets, one outside and then I did the last 4 hours of the terrace, which brought back a bunch of memories! I loved playing and it was a great statement to make.\u201d Fast-forward to the summer of 2015 and things are right where he wants them to be, with Subliminal re-launching in the digital sphere with a whole raft of new ideas and remixes planned for the start of 2016. Tracks like \u2018Welcome To The Jungle\u2019 and \u2018Shiny Disco Balls\u2019 are ripe for remixing, but Erick promises that the focus will remain on the new as much as the classic catalogue. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great music from house to techno \u2013 a little bit of everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be releasing lots of records from different people.\u201d\n\nWith a super-successful summer spent in and out of Space, Ibiza with Luciano\u2019s Cadenza party, as well as key shows from Marquee in New York and LIV in Miami to Avalon in LA and back, Erick is firing on all cylinders. He has several original productions and key collaborations that have now dropped, including \u2018Something For Carl Cox\u2019, a fun techno jam that Erick made for, well, guess who, a searing deep house club track called \u2018The Restorer\u2019 and another with Harry Romero called \u2018Going To LA\u2019. And he also has a solo double-header dropping on Subliminal Records in November 2015. \u201cI\u2019m releasing a two part EP titled Limitless which will consist of a track titled \u2018I Want You\u2019 followed by \u2018Trapped\u2019 - both great records,\u201d he nods. And the label is also gearing up for some major moves at the start of 2016. A-List artists such as Kolsch and The Martinez Brothers will be remixing the very best of the classic catalogue. Erick, meanwhile, is happy to be living in LA. \u201cLA is the place to be, not just because the record industry is there but also the artists. It\u2019s a great place to be and a great place to network. I want to be in the mix!\u201d", "otherInfo": "Presented by Factory 93"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Diplo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9664729.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Psychedelic, Electronica, Reggae, Electronic, Rock", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Diplo, Diplodocus, Wes Gully, and Wes Diplo are all pseudonyms of Wesley Pentz, a Philadelphia-based producer and DJ.

He emerged at Papunya in 1980 as a founding member of the pioneering Warumpi Band, which over three albums (Big Name No Blankets, Go Bush and Too much Humbug) and twenty years of performing thrust contemporary indigenous music into mainstream Australia. Yielding such classic songs as My Island Home, Blackfella Whitefella, Fitzroy Crossing, Jailanguru Pakarnu, Stompin Ground, From The Bush and Waru.\n\nHe has since become one of Australia\u2019s finest singer/songwriters, enjoying a solo career since 1989. He has released a remarkable string of albums - the latest being Blood & Longing.\n\nHis song writing is diverse- from the rollicking Good Light in Broome, the prayerful Native Born, and healing Myall Creek, the roots groove of Long Grass Band and Eddie Mabo, the journeyman monologues of Lights of Hay and Where My People Go, the contemplation of place in Burrumbeep Hill and Whispering Casuarina to the recent Cry My Darling and Byjantic Man.\n\nCollectively, Neil's work has done much to deepen Australia\u2019s contemporary music heritage.\n\nIn 1995, Neil Murray was awarded the APRA song of the year for My Island Home - originally written for the Warumpi Band and re-recorded by Christine Anu. My Island Home featured in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the opening ceremony of the recent 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth games.\n\nIn 2007, Jailanguru Pakarnu- (Out From Jail) a song he co-wrote with Warumpi Band guitarist Sammy Butcher in the indigenous Luritja language- was honoured by the National Film and Sound Archives, Sounds of Australia series, as a significant recording in Australia\u2019s heritage. Credited as the first commercially released pop rock single in an indigenous language. In 2016, My Island Home, as recorded by Christine Anu, received the same honour.\n\nIn recognition of his influence, Neil Murray was awarded the 2017 Port Fairy Folk Festival Artist of the Year.\n\nNeil Murray\u2019s songs have been recorded by Mary Black, Jimmy Little, Missy Higgins, Liz Stringer, Christine Anu, Peter Denahy, Carus, Adam Brand, Amy Saunders, Powderfinger, The Tiddas, Ursula Yovich, Peter Brandy, Emma Donovan and the Warumpi Band.\n\nIn 2019, he is performing nationally for his Blood & Longing tour.\n\nWhispering Casuarina video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/etiA4IsaAD0\nneilmurray.com.au\nyoutube/neilmurraymusic", "otherInfo": "Neil Murray Live Streamed as part of The Saltwater Music Festival.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thesaltystage\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE TIME DIFFERENCE!\n2pm for WA, 4pm for Eastern states and 3.30pm for Central states!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN - https://www.paypal.me/bulukbaraman"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SoDown ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8880511.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Bass Music With Soul.", "Time": "6:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A staple in the Colorado music scene, Ehren River Wright, better known as SoDown is tattooing his own signature on the world of dance music.

Leaving behind a 15-year long\ncareer of production experience in the French hip-hop scene, the Parisian producer became\nfascinated with the sounds of Chicago house and was inspired to create his own productions, infusing his hip-hop influence with the soul of house music.\n\nThen came \u2018Okay\u2019, the track that \u201cchanged the way we listened to music\u201d (Dancing Astronaut) and became the anthem of 2014. It claimed the No. 1 position on Beatport\u2019s House chart for 82 days, remained in the House Chart\u2019s Top 10 for over 180 days, was put on rotation by radio tastemakers like Pete Tong, Annie Mac and Danny Howard and received support from the likes of Claude\nVonStroke, Eats Everything, Green Velvet and nearly every major DJ under the sun. Upon its release, Rolling Stone deemed \u2018Okay\u2019 a \u201cglobal club sensation in waiting,\u201d a prophetic description that couldn\u2019t have rung more true as it remains a commanding moment in DJ sets even to this day.\n\nBut Shiba San is far from a one-hit wonder, following up \u201cOkay\u201d with the award-winning track \u201cBurn Like Fire\u201d (Best Underground Track 2015 IDMA/WMC). With releases out on labels known and loved for their irresistible tunes like Dirtybird and Suara, as well as his own imprint Basement Leak, he\u2019s since seen his career launch off far and beyond the city limits of Paris.\n\nStaying quiet on the public front, Shiba San remains a curious enigma to his international fan base, allowing the music to do the talking for him. In between releases and time spent concocting in the studio, the Miami-based producer remains a mainstay on the nightlife circuit, hitting iconic festivals including Coachella, EDC Las Vegas, Movement Detroit, The BPM Festival in Mexico, The\nWarehouse Project, Stereosonic, Spring Awakening as well as milestone venues like Output in New York, Ministry of Sound in London, Sankeys in Ibiza, Exchange in Los Angeles and The Mid in Chicago.\n\nEnding last year with two impressive Dirtybird releases \u2018Up & Down\u2019 and \u2018You Know What?\u2019, Shiba San began 2017 with a hearty compilation release on his own Basement Leak label featuring his standout tune \u2018Drop It\u2019 before embarking on a North American co-headlining tour with the esteemed MK.

He has released a series of chart-topping albums with sales of over a million copies, sells out the most prestigious concert halls worldwide, composed a string of award-winning film scores and routinely tops audience polls becoming an internet phenomenon. With a unique musical alchemy that draws on elements of classical, rock, electronica and world musics he has rendered traditional ideas of genre and audience divide obsolete and become not only one of the best known composers in the world today but almost certainly the best loved too.\n\nLudovico was born in Turin, Italy and trained as a classical composer and pianist at the Milan Conservatorio before continuing his studies with Luciano Berio, one of the most important composers of the twentieth century avant-garde. His career began with a series of prestigious commissions for institutions such as the USA\u2019s Tanglewood Festival and Paris\u2019 IRCAM but he turned away from what seemed a glittering classical career to forge his own musical path, giving him the freedom to reconcile his wider-ranging influences.\n\nIt was a bold strategy but one quickly rewarded, when Ludovico\u2019s electric harp suite \u2018Stanze\u2019 (1997) was first played on BBC Radio the switchboard jammed with listeners. It was a similar story with his next release \u2018Le Onde\u2019 (1998), a solo piano cycle he performed himself. A listener-organised campaign made it Ludovico\u2019s breakthrough and a permanent fixture atop the Classic FM charts. This upswell of grass roots activity, snowballing with the onset of the internet and social media, has allowed Ludovico to build a uniquely close relationship directly with his audience.\n\n\u2018Le Onde\u2019 also ignited Ludovico\u2019s career in Film & TV music and he has since composed many award-winning scores including \u2018Doctor Zhivago\u2019 (2002) and \u2018Sotto Falso Nome\u2019 (2004) which also became successful albums in their own right. In recent years Shane Meadows\u2019 acclaimed film \u2018This Is England\u2019 (2006) and its television sequel \u2018This Is England \u201886\u2019 (2010) have brought a BAFTA nomination for Ludovico and introduced his music to a huge new audience, Countless television programmes feature his music and the ad world has incorporated it in campaigns for brands including American Airlines, Vodafone, Sony Blu-ray and John Lewis.\n\nLudovico built on the impact of \u2018Le Onde\u2019 with a series of albums notable for their exuberant experimentation. \u2018Eden Roc\u2019 (1999) saw an array of guest musicians and instruments ranging from electric guitar to the Armenian duduk. \u2018I Giorni\u2019 (2001) deepened this engagement with world music in Ludovico\u2019s second collection for solo piano. His \u2018best of\u2019 collection from these first four albums \u2018Echoes: The Einaudi Collection\u2019 (2003) has since sold more than 100,000 copies.\n\nAs Ludovico\u2019s fame grew, his concert schedule naturally grew along with it and became an increasingly important part of his life. It immediately led to two new albums, Diario Mali (2005), a collaboration with kora virtuoso Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko and his first live solo album \u2018La Scala Concert 03.03.03\u2019 (2003), recorded in his adopted city of Milan.\n\nThe release of \u2018Una Mattina\u2019 (2004) saw more \u2018firsts\u2019, it was Ludovico\u2019s debut album on new and current record label Universal and also his most \u2018classical\u2019 to date. Largely written for solo piano, it leapt to the top of the UK Classical album chart and gave him his first sold-out UK tour.\n\nNow one of the most popular composers in the UK and throughout Europe, at home Ludovico\u2019s reputation scaled even loftier heights and thus on May 26th, 2005 in Rome, Ludovico Einaudi was awarded the \u2018Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana\u2019 (or \u2018OMRI\u2019) the senior order of Knighthood bestowed by the Italian Republic.\n\nThe stage was set for \u2018Divenire\u2019 (2007) his most musically ambitious album yet and his greatest commercial success to date. \u2018Divenire\u2019 gathered many of the musical \u2018streams\u2019 that had flowed through Ludovico\u2019s career and expanded on them with the help of The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and a battery of digital effects.\n\nOn release it became a phenomenon, topping classical charts throughout Europe and crashing the Italian pop charts. With sales in excess of 300,000 copies and a BRIT awards \u2018Album of the Year\u2019 nomination, Ludovico embarked on his biggest tour yet, 80 dates across Europe. One was captured for his second live album \u2018Live In Berlin\u2019 (2008) and it all culminated at a memorable concert at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nWith people around the globe now clamoring to see him Ludovico became a permanent fixture on the road, traveling to new audiences in India, Japan and the USA. Along the way he formed a collaboration with Robert Lippock of post-rock band \u2018To Rococo Rot\u2019 and the results would be heard in two albums released in 2009, one featuring Ludovico as \u2018band member\u2019, the other as a solo artist.\n\nFirst was \u2018Cloudland\u2019 (2009) the debut from \u2018Whitetree\u2019 - comprising Ludovico on piano, Robert Lippok on electronics, and Robert\u2019s brother Ronald Lippok on drums - which has a sunny African feel amid the cutting-edge electronics and percussion.\n\n\u2018Nightbook\u2019 (2009) Ludovico\u2019s seventh solo album was a perfect contrast. Meditative and introspective it charts an inward voyage through dreams and the shadows of the psyche with evocative use of electronics. Ludovico calls it his \u2018Dark Side of The Moon\u2019 and though challenging, it too found immediate resonance with his audience who once again took Ludovico to the summit of the charts and back into the concert halls.\n\nThe \u2018Nightbook\u2019 tour produced \u2018The Royal Albert Hall Concert\u2019 (2010) a double CD and DVD documenting Ludovico\u2019s concert at the venue in March 2010. Drawing on every part of a now distinguished career, it shows a composer and performer at the very height of his creative powers.\n\nIN A TIME LAPSE \u2013 (2013)\nIn A Time Lapse was composed over a period of two years and recorded in October 2012 in a monastery near Verona, Italy.\nThe 14 pieces that compose the album range between piano, strings, percussion and electronics. As with the previous albums, In A Time Lapse develops as a suite with a concept that recalls the form of a novel divided in different chapters.\nEpic and emotional as Divenire, experimental and adventurous as Nightbook, In A Time Lapse moves even further exploring new textures and arrangements that blends different musical worlds into one. Within the classical style of Ludovico, in this album you can hear echoes of baroque and Italian folk music, late romantic strings textures, and a wide variety of colors between percussion and electronics, appearing throughout a journey that transport the listener through a deep reflection on the idea of time, with the words of Ludovico \"when you get conscious that our time is limited, it\u2019s the moment where you try to fill that space with all your energy and emotions and start to imagine beyond the limits and live every moment of your life fully as when you were a child\".\n\nThe album features Ludovico's band, the string orchestra I Virtuosi Italiani and violinist Daniel\nHope that appears in four pieces: Life and Experience together with I Virtuosi Italiani, Underwood, a touching duet with Ludovico, and Orbits where the solo violin climbs the sky towards infinity.\n\nWith albums topping innumerable charts and concerts selling out the world\u2019s most prestigious halls, country after country has taken Ludovico to its heart and seem certain to continue to for many years to come.\n\n\nFor more information contact: Karen Lee at Evolution Promotion - 978.658.3357 or at klee@evolutionpromotion.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ATYYA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8968433.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Deep Dubstep, Downtempo, Bass Music, Chillstep, Trap", "Time": "8:45 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ATYYA - pronounced [ Ah-Tie-Ah ].

The Colorado-based saxophonist/producer, Dominic Lalli and drummer, Jeremy Salken, are veterans of blending electronic dance music with their live instruments to create Big G's truly unique sound; a sound that is as thoughtful as it is danceable. Big Gigantic mixes musically mature melodies with addictive beats and samples, that are familiar to a Kanye West or LCD Soundsystem single, and crosses all styles of music from jazz to hip hop, funk to dubstep.\n\nTheir fifth most recent studio album, Brighter Future, reflects Lalli and Salken\u2019s vision for uniting the world through music and community. Lalli wrote, \u201cNow more than ever, we need to come together and work towards a brighter future for us, our children and for the human race as a whole.\u201d The album was released on August 26, 2016 and features special guests Waka Flocka Flame, Logic, Cherub, Griz, Pell, and many more.

Angela McCluskey has received national acclaim, with over 1 million downloads, 20+ million streams, and landing sync placements everywhere from Fox's breakthrough show \u2018Empire\u2019 to ESPN's Wimbledon 2016 & NBA coverage.\n\nBig Gigantic\u2019s impact stretches much farther than their music. After donating tens of thousands of dollars, school supplies, food and other items to those in need through their #ABigGiganticDifference initiative, Lalli and Salken have taken their give-back mission to the next level. In Fall of 2016, the duo founded the nonprofit A Big Gigantic Difference Foundation with the mission to spread positivity and enact change alongside their fans and community through #ABDG events, fundraising initiatives, and donations from ticket sales.\nIn 2017, they switched their model of giving many small gifts for a greater impact large donation. The first ABGDFoundation partnership was announced in the summer of 2017 with the Denver, CO nonprofit, Youth On Record who will be the recipient of the majority of the funds raised in for the year. The gift of over $40,000 will build out, update and support instruction for a stationary computer lab at Youth on Record\u2019s headquarters.\n\n2017 also marked the sixth year of Big Gignatic\u2019s own headlining, two- night festival, Rowdytown , at Colorado's famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre.

He emerged at Papunya in 1980 as a founding member of the pioneering Warumpi Band, which over three albums (Big Name No Blankets, Go Bush and Too much Humbug) and twenty years of performing thrust contemporary indigenous music into mainstream Australia. Yielding such classic songs as My Island Home, Blackfella Whitefella, Fitzroy Crossing, Jailanguru Pakarnu, Stompin Ground, From The Bush and Waru.\n\nHe has since become one of Australia\u2019s finest singer/songwriters, enjoying a solo career since 1989. He has released a remarkable string of albums - the latest being Blood & Longing.\n\nHis song writing is diverse- from the rollicking Good Light in Broome, the prayerful Native Born, and healing Myall Creek, the roots groove of Long Grass Band and Eddie Mabo, the journeyman monologues of Lights of Hay and Where My People Go, the contemplation of place in Burrumbeep Hill and Whispering Casuarina to the recent Cry My Darling and Byjantic Man.\n\nCollectively, Neil's work has done much to deepen Australia\u2019s contemporary music heritage.\n\nIn 1995, Neil Murray was awarded the APRA song of the year for My Island Home - originally written for the Warumpi Band and re-recorded by Christine Anu. My Island Home featured in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the opening ceremony of the recent 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth games.\n\nIn 2007, Jailanguru Pakarnu- (Out From Jail) a song he co-wrote with Warumpi Band guitarist Sammy Butcher in the indigenous Luritja language- was honoured by the National Film and Sound Archives, Sounds of Australia series, as a significant recording in Australia\u2019s heritage. Credited as the first commercially released pop rock single in an indigenous language. In 2016, My Island Home, as recorded by Christine Anu, received the same honour.\n\nIn recognition of his influence, Neil Murray was awarded the 2017 Port Fairy Folk Festival Artist of the Year.\n\nNeil Murray\u2019s songs have been recorded by Mary Black, Jimmy Little, Missy Higgins, Liz Stringer, Christine Anu, Peter Denahy, Carus, Adam Brand, Amy Saunders, Powderfinger, The Tiddas, Ursula Yovich, Peter Brandy, Emma Donovan and the Warumpi Band.\n\nIn 2019, he is performing nationally for his Blood & Longing tour.\n\nWhispering Casuarina video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/etiA4IsaAD0\nneilmurray.com.au\nyoutube/neilmurraymusic", "otherInfo": "Neil Murray Live Streamed as part of The Saltwater Music Festival.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thesaltystage\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE TIME DIFFERENCE!\n2pm for WA, 4pm for Eastern states and 3.30pm for Central states!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN - https://www.paypal.me/bulukbaraman"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SoDown ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8880511.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Bass Music With Soul.", "Time": "6:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A staple in the Colorado music scene, Ehren River Wright, better known as SoDown is tattooing his own signature on the world of dance music.

With releases out on labels known and loved for their irresistible tunes like Dirtybird and Suara, as well as his own imprint Basement Leak, he\u2019s since seen his career launch off far and beyond the city limits of Paris.\n\nStaying quiet on the public front, Shiba San remains a curious enigma to his international fan base, allowing the music to do the talking for him. In between releases and time spent concocting in the studio, the Miami-based producer remains a mainstay on the nightlife circuit, hitting iconic festivals including Coachella, EDC Las Vegas, Movement Detroit, The BPM Festival in Mexico, The\nWarehouse Project, Stereosonic, Spring Awakening as well as milestone venues like Output in New York, Ministry of Sound in London, Sankeys in Ibiza, Exchange in Los Angeles and The Mid in Chicago.\n\nEnding last year with two impressive Dirtybird releases \u2018Up & Down\u2019 and \u2018You Know What?\u2019, Shiba San began 2017 with a hearty compilation release on his own Basement Leak label featuring his standout tune \u2018Drop It\u2019 before embarking on a North American co-headlining tour with the esteemed MK.

Yet the common thread that runs through Craig\u2019s broad musical canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. Carl Craig has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader, guided by his tendency toward forward\nthinking.\n\nCraig released his first track in 1989. One of his earliest mentors and first collaborator was Derrick May, whose imprint Craig also released some of his early music on.\n\nIn 1991, wanting pure artistic freedom, Craig set up his own label Planet-E and released \u20184 Jazz Funk Classics\u2019, under the moniker 69, as the label\u2019s first release. From here his wild exploration of sound intensified\u2026\n\nA Gemini true to form, with a mind that never sits still, Craig has released a diverse range of experimental and groundbreaking music under a plethora of aliases including 69, BFC, C2, Innerzone Orchestra (\u2018Bug in the Bassbin\u2019 was credited as the spark that inspired the evolution of drum\u2018n\u2019bass), No Boundaries, Psyche, Paperclip People, Tres Demented, Urban Tribe and many more. He has also produced albums for the legendary Detroit Jazz collective Tribe as well as orchestrator / pianist Francesco Tristano and French producer Agoria.\n\nLive he has collaborated with Les si\u00e8cles orchestra at Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris. A meeting of techno and classical music, the concert was described as \u201chistorical\u201d, Craig went on to repeat the formula in Milan and Germany. He regularly performs live as experimental outfit Trio with Moritz Von Oswald and Francesco Tristano, sometimes as Narod Niki alongside Villalobos, Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Zip and others, and regularly does part live and part DJ with Luciano. Additionally he\u2019s\ntaken to occasionally bringing keyboardists like Mike Banks (UR), Amp Fiddler and Tristano into the DJ booth with him for special one-off gigs. He also improvised live to an Andy Warhol film at the Unsound Festival in New York. In 2011, Craig went live as 69 for the first time ever, fusing masks, darkness and the music of 69, Craig created 69\u2019s own entity and previewed the show to a few select festivals and clubs around the world.\n\nHis remixes discography boasts some of the most desirable names in music \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Junior Boys (nominated for a Grammy Award), Gavin Russom & Delia Gonzalez, Theo Parrish, Tori Amos, Can, Goldfrapp, Friendly Fires, Caribou, Tiga, Unkle, Yello and more.\n\nAs well as an outlet for his own productions, his Planet-E imprint has given a home to a wide range of Detroit-based artists including Francesco Mora Catlett, Naomi Daniel, Flexitone, Jason Hogans, Kenny Larkin, Monty Luke, Moodyman, Mike Agent X, Oliverwho Factory, Ezana Harris, Recloose, Reference, Kevin Saunderson, Big Tone, Tribe, Urban Tribe, and Chaz Vincent.\n\nStaying strong to his Detroit roots, where he still lives today, Craig helped launched the Detroit Electronic music Festival in 2000 and remains a strong force at the festival today. He has also created and launched his non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation: \u201cThe concept is to find ways to re-educate kids about what\u2019s interesting musically that you can\u2019t get on the radio\u2026 To develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of Detroit music being diverse and interesting, to spot out the most talented young musicians coming out of high school and lend small financial grants to encourage music education at a higher level.\u201d\n\nWhen Craig explains his philosophy, his wry sense of humor seeps into his explanations of far-reaching concepts that merge worlds together. \u201cI have a very special career. When I feel that I\u2019m tired of going on the road I can go in the studio. When I\u2019m tired of concentrating on the studio I can go on the road. I can work with concert pianists, jazz musicians or rock guys. Very few people\nhave that range of interests. Very few people juggle a career that they choose specifically.\u201d No one else can pull it all together quite like Carl Craig.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Grove ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8190956.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Herz Und Seele, Brett Und Akustik F\u00fcr Hoffnung", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Es groovt, hat verdammt viel Dynamik, Songs mit deutschen und englischen Texten, Melodien inspiriert von Weltschmerz, Liebe, Wut und Gl\u00fcckseligkeit, das ist GROVE.

Her singing melts into the clear rhythm of GROVE\u2019s accompanying musicians, and stirs up emotions that any true Rock\u00b4n\u00b4Roll-soul could wish for. With their stunning and distinct mixture of deeply touching and rocking songs GROVE accomplishes to capture their listeners\u2019 hearts. GROVE \u2013 emotion unleashed! Alles begann Anfang 2008 mit einem Spontanjam zwischen Robert \u201cGrobi\u201c Radeka (ehem. Hate Squad) und Eve H\u00fcbener (ehem. Castaway, Mobster) auf dem Zytanien Open Air. Schnell war klar, dass das gemeinsame Potenzial voll ausgesch\u00f6pft werden musste. Mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Alex (ehem. Loungefly) am Bass, fanden die ersten gemeinsamen Akustik-Konzerte statt. F\u00fcr die perkussive Begleitung sorgte seinerzeit Hannes Weber, Drummer der Phunkas Symatrix. Weil sich die Rock \u00b4n\u00b4 Roll Seele langfristig nicht nur mit gediegenem Akustik-Sound zufrieden geben kann, wurden im Sommer 2009 die gute alte Paula und die druckfreudige Ricki entstaubt ;) und ihrer eigentlichen Bestimmung zugef\u00fchrt: dem dr\u00f6hnenden Fr\u00f6nen \u00fcber die guten alten R\u00f6hren. Aber \u201cOhne Drummer kein vern\u00fcnftiges Gitarrengejammer\u201c, so stie\u00df Stefan Reese (ehem. Sonic Front, Mindwise) am Schlagzeug hinzu, um dem bisherigen und zuk\u00fcnftigen Repertoire seinen Soundstempel aufzudr\u00fccken. Es entstehen u.a. die Songs \u201cEssenziell\u201c und \u201cInfancy, Maturity & Uncertainty\u201c, die mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Lars Oppermann (Eat No Fish, Superstarfuckers, Dan Hiob Experiment, High Speed Karmageddon) in 2010 dann die ersten Tracks auf ihrem aktuellen Demo werden. 2011 wird Martin als zweiter Gitarrist angeheuert um den Grove-Sound auch LIVE noch fetter zu gestalten. Pressestimmen: \u201cMan w\u00e4hnt sich in der Flower-Power-\u00c4ra. Sp\u00e4te Sechziger, Singer-Songwriter-Rock mit politischer und gesellschaftskritischer Aussage. Aber immer entspannt. Man riecht imagin\u00e4re R\u00e4ucherst\u00e4bchen, auf die B\u00fchne werden aber gro\u00dfe Seifenblasen geschickt, davor tanzen einige Fans gl\u00fcckselig, w\u00e4hrend die Band einen intensiven, immer aber sehr lockeren Auftritt hinlegt. W\u00e4re Joni Mitchell noch dabei gewesen, das h\u00e4tte ins Bild gepasst.\u201d (Rockszene - 27. April 2009) \u201cAb und zu durften es bei Eve, Grobi & Co. auch mal leicht poppige Hooks \u00fcber straighte Rocknummern sein. Grove setzten im Verlauf ihres Sets auf sehr viel Abwechslung, was sich auch in den teils deutschen, teils englischen Texten widerspiegelte. Beiden Bands sehr gemein sein d\u00fcrfte die stetige Spielfreunde im Rocker und das Herzblut, dass sie im Verlaufe ihrer Shows hier gleich literweise vergossen.\u201d (Rockszene - 03.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists. The first external track to be released was Rusch and Murray\u2019s much talked about \u2018Epic\u2019 \u2013 a track made entirely across Internet forums by two producers who\u2019ve never met \u2013, with subsequent signings including Finnish trance maestro Super8 (who later joined forces with DJ Tab), talented UK duo Smith & Pledger and Dutch Deep Tech Genius, Stephen J.Kroos.\n\nSince then, the roster has expanded to over 30 artists and Anjunabeats has earned a reputation as one the most consistent dance labels in the world, with its releases proving to be essential tools for many of the world's top DJs. In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

Coming up near Chicago in the early 90s, Intel grew up in the early days of Hip Hop with a fascination for turntablism. He quickly hit the decks with a set of turntables and a mixer he \u201cborrowed\u201d from his brother, and started off on the path that Chicago DJ legends like PNS and Tone B Nimble paved. Between the house parties and the B-boy battles, Intel quickly made a name for himself across the Midwest.\n\nIntel still holds down the decks for the B-boys, but his scope and style--fueled by his limitless passion and innovation--have evolved. The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece.

Truthfully, it embodies an ironclad creative bond, familial brotherhood, and a lifelong commitment to fans. At this point, it goes without saying the band means everything (and more) to the Kalamazoo, MI bluegrass mavericks.\n\nSo, with a wink and a smile, they offer up a cleverly titled seventh full-length, All For Money, in 2019.\n\nHoffman dispels the obvious first: \u201cClearly, we aren\u2019t a band all for money. We did it for romantic reasons such as love, catharsis, and because it mattered to us and the listeners. We wanted to have fun with the paradox of the title though. We\u2019re truly blessed and humbled to have our dreams come true and do what we do. However, it would be easy to make decisions based on our needs to eat or the desires of others, but that\u2019s not doing it for love. We love what we do, and we\u2019re grateful for the love we receive in return from the people listening.\u201d\n\nAs time goes on, the guys continue to do things for the \u201cright reasons,\u201d and that mindset resonates louder and louder amongst a growing fan base. A live force of nature renowned for bringing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll showmanship to high-energy bluegrass, the group has sold out hallowed venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the legendary Ryman Auditorium in addition to igniting stages everywhere from Bonnaroo and New Orleans Jazz Festival to Austin City Limits and Outside Lands. Their unpredictable performances remain the stuff of legend attracting diehard devotees who typically travel far and wide to experience multiple gigs. In 2014, If Sorrows Swim bowed at #1 on the Billboard Top Bluegrass Albums Chart, while the 2016 follow-up Shouted, Written Down & Quoted cracked the Top 3. Along the way, they have also earned praise from Billboard, AXS, Westword, and more.\n\nOn All For Money, Greensky once again aimed to progress. This time around, the musicians kept the show top of mind as they composed the music.\n\n\u201cWe have a motto where we want every show to be harder, better, longer, and faster,\u201d admits Hoffman. \u201cWith All For Money, I felt like we were serving the performance more by writing and arranging material in a way we would intend to play it on stage. We tried to incorporate a lot of what we already do live, which is different for us in the studio.\u201d\n\nThey recorded March-May at Echo Mountain Sound in Asheville, NC. In the studio, they worked with longtime friend Dominic John Davis as producer. According to Hoffman, Davis offered a fresh perspective on \u201chow to balance the studio and concerts.\u201d Amplifying the sonic palette, signatures such as dobro tone, bass grooves, and banjo took the spotlight.\n\nThe first single \u201cDo It Alone\u201d feels equally at home on a festival stage as it does blaring through your soundsystem. Backed by a robust groove, the song transforms traditional bluegrass instrumentation into a rich sonic backdrop highlighted by a mandolin awash in a trio of effects as well as rich echoed vocals and emotive lyrics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been trying to write a windows-down rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tune for a while,\u201d explains Hoffman. \u201cI got out an old guitar of mine, re-strung it, and immediately spit the song out. It\u2019s meant to be an anthem. I ask myself, \u2018Why do I do it alone?\u2019 It\u2019s because I\u2019ve got a whole room of thousands singing at the top of their lungs with me. Whenever I write something emotional that might be difficult to sing, I\u2019m reminded of the fact the crowd is there. Hopefully, it\u2019s a reminder for other people as well and we all have something to chant together.\u201d\n\nHot on its heels, the intriguing and irresistible \u201cMurder of Crows\u201d takes flight on kinetic performances as it delivers an emotionally charged message and provocative narrative. \u201cThis is a song that Aaron and I wrote about disconnection, drifting apart, loss, and remorse,\u201d Dave Bruzza reveals. \u201cIt also touches on a cry for help and how it was not heard in time. A friend told me crows had funerals. He explained that farmers used to nail a crow to the fence or barn door to get rid of them eating the crops. Thee birds would gather, pay their respects, and fly off never to\nreturn. It was interesting. I began to think why people disappear in our lives. It came together with the mysterious letter someone received, and it all made sense to turn this into a story.\u201d\n\nAlso originally penned by Bruzza, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Mine Anymore\u201d\u2019 illustrates the group\u2019s virtuosity with a \u201cmetal\u201d spirit. Elsewhere, \u201cWish I Didn\u2019t Know\u201d hinges on a trance-y Mandolin passage that proves instantly hypnotic, and \u201cDo Harm\u201d taps into an upbeat bounce by way of an an off-kilter rhythm. Meanwhile, the title track spirals into psychedelic territory during a head-spinning two-minute midsection before culminating on an important statement.\n\n\u201cIt feels liberating to be honest about it,\u201d he remarks. \u201cWith the title track, we were asking more of the listeners than we ever have, but the line \u2018If you need a voice, I\u2019m yours friend\u2019 is meant for them.\u201d\n\nIn the end, all the right reasons continue to drive Greensky Bluegrass.\n\n\u201cAs songwriters and musicians, we have a need for people to be on board, and we\u2019re not just regurgitating the same shit,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing ourselves every time. I hope they want to listen to the record and hear the songs live. I hope they know we\u2019re doing this for us and them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "We'll be airing sets from years past and celebrating the spirit that you all bring to this event!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Aqeel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6852733.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bookings and Business Queries: bookings@djaqeel.com // info@djaqeel.com //", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Umphrey's McGee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8463942.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Progressive Rock, Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Umphrey's McGee is a progressive rock / jam band from South Bend, Indiana. The band's moniker is a twist on the name of a second cousin of singer and guitarist Brendan Bayliss named Humphrey McGee.\n\nIn late 2004, the band was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to be the successors to the jam band throne previously held by Phish.\n\nThey are much more influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also \"identifies The Police, The Beatles, The Monkees, Nick D'Virgilio, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences with a reverence the members describe as 'Biblical.'\" [2] However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to James Taylor.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. Early concerts consisted of both originals and cover songs, including Guns N' Roses's \"Patience\" and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts theme \"Linus and Lucy.\"\n\nIn mid-1998, after only 8 months together, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as \"Divisions\" and \"All in Time.\"\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar).\n\nThe band released another live album, One Fat Sucka, which contained live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, the first annual Bonnaroo Festival took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date. They would go on to play Bonnaroo in 2004 and again in 2006.\n\nThe band almost ended in late 2002 when drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving the band to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.\n\nIn 2004, the band released the critically acclaimed Anchor Drops, and released Safety in Numbers two years later in April 2006.\n\nIn April, 2007, Umphrey's released their fifth studio effort, The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions. The album was supported with tours of the USA, Europe, and Japan.\n\nBrendan Bayliss is also working on a studio album with Jeff Austin of Yonder Mountain String Band.", "otherInfo": "We're teaming up with Live From Out There to bring you Summer Camp Virtual Festival: A 20 Year Retrospective featuring live music, throwback performances, interviews, unique moments, giveaways, and a virtual gathering you won't soon forget...

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Maria Moon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9032628.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock Violinist, Video Game Music, Classical, Covers, Electric Violin, Film Music, Keyboardist, Violinist, Cover Band, Violin Live Music", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hello!

'Rosa' is the most personal, mature and intimate album by Lu\u00edsa Sobral.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brice Masson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351433.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock, Blues, Folk, Country Blues, Boogie Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Des guitares DIY en jerrycan, caisse de vin, caisse de transport, une style au carrefour du Blues, du Rock, de la Country et de la Folk.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

Inspired by such visceral singers as Janis Joplin and Tina Turner, she left school at sixteen to follow her own dreams. Dilana soon found herself with a promising music career in Holland, becoming one of the country's most coveted live acts. Recording and releasing the album Wonderfool in 2000 yielded five singles, four videos and a string of touring and festival gigs throughout the region, celebrating her natural talents as a songwriter and performer.\n\nBy way of Houston, Dilana arrived in L.A. and auditioned to compete on TV's \"Rock Star Supernova.\" Quoted in the Hollywood Press, \"The moment she stepped on the Mayan Theatre stage for Episode 1 and performed 'Lithium,' Dilana instantly became the show's frontrunner.\" Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence amassed legions of new fans from around the world.

Led by the incomparable singer and songwriter Paul Rodgers, arguably the finest singer in rock 'n ' roll and a huge songwriting talent.\n\nFormed in 1973, Bad Company came to life when Rodgers was looking to start anew after the disintegration of his legendary band Free. His powerhouse vocals and songwriting were a main ingredient during Free's impressive five-year run; a period of time that saw the release of seven extremely influential albums that featured Free's minimalist blues-rock approach. Included among Free's dynamic body of work is the 1970 smash, \"All Right Now,\" one of the most recognizable rock anthems ever recorded. Lyrics and melody by Rodgers. He was Free\u2019s main songwriter.\n\nRodgers had met Mott The Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and after jamming together and listening to new songs that Ralphs had penned and songs that Rodgers had penned, Ralphs made the decision to leave Mott and form a new band with Rodgers. The duo recruited former King Crimson bassist/vocalist Boz Burrell, added drummer Simon Kirke and christened themselves Bad Company, the name inspired by Rodgers. Rodgers\u2019 brought in Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant and Bad Company became the first band signed to Zeppelin's Swan Song label. \"I had to fight to get the management and the record company to accept the name Bad Company,\" explains Rodgers. \"They thought it was a terrible name. Peter Grant called a meeting and the band met beforehand. I told them that I had been through this before with Free as Island Records had wanted to call us the Heavy Metal Kids. We agreed to go in and tell them that we were going to be called Bad Company and that was the end of the story. As soon as Peter heard how strongly I felt about the name, he became very supportive and he and I turned the record company around.\"", "otherInfo": "Join us on Facebook for a Memorial Weekend Fan Flashback live stream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nicki Sbaffoni Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8549363.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Acoustic, Pop, Cover Band", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With a mantra of \"strum and wail\u201d, Nicki Sbaffoni consistently surprises and delights audiences with powerful and creatively twisted versions of all your favorite songs.

Having enjoyed success through the late 90s and 00s producing house music under a variety of different aliases, Tim launched Satin Jackets as a vehicle to finally explore his lifelong love of disco.\n\nInspired by the clean productions of artists like CHIC and studio genius Trevor Horn, Tim set to reintroduce that polish and sheen back into the modern disco scene. \u201cI had always been fascinated by how glossy people like Nile Rogers made their music,\u201d Tim explains. \u201cIt always sounded like the musical equivalent of a fashion magazine\u2019s cover. I\u2019d been making more underground music for a while but really wanted to go in totally the other direction and create a really smooth, polished sound.\u201d\n\nThe result was \u2018You Make Me Feel Good\u2019, a sublimely laidback slice of Balearic House that introduced Satin Jackets to the world. Released on storied Belgian label Eskimo Recordings, who had previously helped launch the careers of artists like Aeroplane and Lindstrom, the single quickly established Tim as one to watch amongst the thriving nu-disco scene.\n\nFollowing on from this auspicious debut a string of acclaimed singles, and remixes for some of the genre\u2019s biggest names including Goldroom and Blank & Jones, would regularly emerge from Tim\u2019s remote forest studio. Whilst the face behind Satin Jackets may have remained a mystery his warm sound was fast becoming very familiar to music lovers around the world.\n\nFirmly established as one of Eskimo\u2019s flagship artists Tim would define the Satin Jackets\u2019 sound with his debut album \u2018Panorama Pacifico\u2019 in 2016. Featuring collaborations with artists including Scavenger Hunt, NTEIBINT and Marble Sounds the album won praise from the likes of Mixmag, DJ Mag and Groove, led to gigs around the world and to date has been streamed on Spotify more than 30 million times.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels though Tim has continued to refine the Satin Jackets\u2019 sound. Following the success of \u2018Panorama Pacifico\u2019 he\u2019s steadily built up a close-knit family of collaborators including British singers David Harks and Emma Brammer and US vocalist Niya Wells, and continued to go from strength to strength with singles such as \u2018Northern Lights\u2019 and \u2018Mirage\u2019 all clocking up millions of plays.\n\nWith album number 2 scheduled for release in early 2019 Tim can\u2019t wait for people to hear the new record. \u201cEven in just the last couple of years I\u2019ve really made some big changes to how I produce music. Compared to the first album you could say that everything under the hood has changed,\u201d he explains. \u201cEvery day, with every production I\u2019m learning new things and when I listen to these new tracks, the depth in the mixes, the clarity, I like to think of the new album as Satin Jackets but in 3D. \u201c\n\nFrom wanting to recreate the sound of magazine covers to appearing on them, the past few years has been quite some journey for the still enigmatic producer, but despite the ever-growing army of fans from every corner of the world Tim remains grounded. Hidden away in the unlikely surroundings of one of Germany\u2019s ancient forests, out of sight but fully in control, Tim is producing music that reflects the glamour and glitz of 70s Manhattan, artfully updated for the 21st century.", "otherInfo": "Dance From Home brings you performances from world-class DJs while offering a simple way to make a difference in the current crisis.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ten F\u00e9 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8882615.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Listen to WON'T HAPPEN'\nhttp://smarturl.it/TenFeWH\n\nPre-order CD/LP/MP3\nhttp://smarturl.it/TenFeFPPT", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "dj Strain ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10327832.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Deep House, Tech House, House, Funky House, Techno, Soulful House", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tune in for next episode of house stories live streamed straight to your ears & souls ...\n.\n.\nYoutube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyW3O7KTmk3kQQ1FNsSYGKg\n\nMixcloud LIVE:\n\nhttps://www.mixcloud.com/live/djstrain\n\nTwitch.tv:\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/djstrain_official\n\nPeriscope (pscp.tv) by twitter:\n\nhttps://www.pscp.tv/djStrain_\n.\n.\n#housemusic #dj #djlife #djlifestyle #deephouse #funkyhouse #vocalhouse #techhouse #livestream #praguedjlife #playwithpassion #dowhatyoulove #nevergiveup #neverstop #housemusicalllifelong #inourhouseweareallequal"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jean Tonique ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7881621.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "BOOKING WORLDWIDE : olivia@thetalentboutique.fr BOOKING NORTH / SOUTH AMERICA : adam.ogushwitz@unitedtalent.com MGMT : matthieu@grand-mgmt.com", "otherInfo": "Dance From Home brings you performances from world-class DJs while offering a simple way to make a difference in the current crisis.

Buy LP/CD from http://www.juliajacklin.com or stream online.\n\nThe second full-length album from Australian singer/songwriter Julia Jacklin, Crushing embodies every possible meaning of its title word. It\u2019s an album formed from sheer intensity of feeling, an in-the-moment narrative of heartbreak and infatuation. And with her storytelling centered on bodies and crossed boundaries and smothering closeness, Crushing reveals how our physical experience of the world shapes and sometimes distorts our inner lives.\n\n\u201cThis album came from spending two years touring and being in a relationship, and feeling like I never had any space of my own,\u201d says the Melbourne-based artist. \u201cFor a long time I felt like my head was full of fear and my body was just this functional thing that carried me from point A to B, and writing these songs was like rejoining the two.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to her 2016 debut Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win, Crushing finds Jacklin continually acknowledging what\u2019s expected of her, then gracefully rejecting those expectations. As a result, the album invites self-examination and a possible shift in the listener\u2019s way of getting around the world\u2014an effect that has everything to do with Jacklin\u2019s openness about her own experience.\n\n\u201cI used to be so worried about seeming demanding that I\u2019d put up with anything, which I think is common\u2014you want to be chill and cool, but it ends up taking so much of your emotional energy,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotten used to calling out things I\u2019m not okay with, instead of just burying my feelings to make it easier on everyone. I\u2019ve realized that in order to keep the peace, you have to speak up for yourself and say what you really want.\u201d\n\nProduced by Burke Reid (Courtney Barnett, The Drones) and recorded at The Grove Studios (a bushland hideaway built by INXS\u2019 Garry Gary Beers), Crushing sets Jacklin\u2019s understated defiance against a raw yet luminous sonic backdrop. \u201cIn all the songs, you can hear every sound from every instrument; you can hear my throat and hear me breathing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really important to me that you can hear everything for the whole record, without any studio tricks getting in the way.\u201d\n\nOn the album-opening lead single \u201cBody,\u201d Jacklin proves the power of that approach, turning out a mesmerizing vocal performance even as she slips into the slightest murmur. A starkly composed portrait of a breakup, the song bears an often-bracing intimacy, a sense that you\u2019re right in the room with Jacklin as she lays her heart out. And as \u201cBody\u201d wanders and drifts, Jacklin establishes Crushing as an album that exists entirely on its own time, a work that\u2019s willfully unhurried.\n\nFrom there, Crushing shifts into the slow-building urgency of \u201cHead Alone,\u201d a pointed and electrifying anthem of refusal (sample lyric: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched all the time/I raised my body up to be mine\u201d). \u201cAs a woman, in my case as a touring musician, the way you\u2019re touched is different from your male bandmates\u2014by strangers and by those close to you,\u201d notes Jacklin. On the full-tilt, harmony-spiked \u201cPressure to Party,\u201d she pushes toward another form of emotional freedom. \u201cWhen you come out of a relationship, there\u2019s so much pressure to act a certain way,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cFirst it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve gotta take some time for yourself\u2019\u2026but then if you take too much time it\u2019s, \u2018You\u2019ve gotta get back out there!\u2019 That song is just my three-minute scream, saying I\u2019m going to do what I need to do, when I need to do it.\u201d Crushing also shows Jacklin\u2019s autonomy on songs like \u201cConvention,\u201d an eye-rolling dismissal of unsolicited advice, presented in elegantly sardonic lyrics (\u201cI can tell you won\u2019t sleep well, if you don\u2019t teach me how to do it right\u201d).\n\nElsewhere on Crushing, Jacklin brings her exacting reflection to songs on loss. With its transportive harmonies and slow-burning guitar solo, \u201cDon\u2019t Know How to Keep Loving You\u201d ponders the heartache in fading affection (\u201cI want your mother to stay friends with mine/I want this feeling to pass in time\u201d). Meanwhile, on \u201cTurn Me Down\u201d\u2014an idiosyncratically arranged track embedded with hypnotic guitar tones\u2014Jacklin gives an exquisitely painful glimpse at unrequited devotion (\u201cHe took my hand, said I see a bright future/I\u2019m just not sure that you\u2019re in it\u201d). \u201cThat song destroyed me in the studio,\u201d says Jacklin of \u201cTurn Me Down,\u201d whose middle section contains a particularly devastating vocal performance. \u201cI remember lying on the floor in a total state between what felt like endless takes, and if you listen it kind of sounds like I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d And on \u201cWhen the Family Flies In,\u201d Jacklin shares her first ever piano-driven piece, a beautifully muted elegy for the same friend to whom she dedicated Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win. \u201cThere are really no words to do justice to what it feels like to lose a friend,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cIt felt a bit cheap to even try to write a song about it, but this one came out on tour and it finally felt okay to record.\n\nDespite its complexity, Crushing unfolds with an ease that echoes Jacklin\u2019s newfound self-reliance as an artist. Originally from the Blue Mountains, she grew up on her parents\u2019 Billy Bragg and Doris Day records and sang in musicals as a child, then started writing her own songs in her early 20s. \u201cWith the first album I was so nervous and didn\u2019t quite see myself as a musician yet, but after touring for two years, I\u2019ve come to feel like I deserve to be in that space,\u201d she says.\n\nThroughout Crushing, that sense of confidence manifests in one of the most essential elements of the album: the captivating strength of Jacklin\u2019s lyrics. Not only proof of her ingenuity and artistic generosity, Jacklin\u2019s uncompromising specificity and infinitely unpredictable turns of phrase ultimately spring from a certain self-possession in the songwriting process.\n\n\u201cAs I was making this album there was sort of a slow loosening of pressure on myself,\u201d Jacklin says. \u201cThere\u2019ve been some big life changes for me over the last few years, and I just found it too tiring to try to cover things up with a lot of metaphors and word trickery. I just wanted to lay it all out there and trust that, especially at such a tense moment in time, other people might want to hear a little vulnerability.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Overdosed ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380512.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "House, Edm, Future House", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Not now.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/xxoverdosed", "otherInfo": "Cykl #stayoverdosed to cotygodniowa dawka starannie wyselekcjowanej muzyki w najlepszym mo\u017cliwym wydaniu - na \u017cywo \ud83d\udc4c Zapraszamy na kolejny set Overdosed streamowany w serwisie Twitch.tv.\n\nTransmisja odb\u0119dzie si\u0119 tutaj \ud83d\udc49 twitch.tv/xxoverdosed\n\nDo zobaczenia w sobot\u0119 o 20:00! #stayoverdosed \ud83d\udcaa"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stream ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/202026.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Dance, Electronic", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Caddy Cooper ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:45 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Stereo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10391079.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop Punk, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Stereo is a pop rock/rock and roll band started in 1999 by former ska/punk band frontmen Jamie Woolford (of Animal Chin) and Rory Phillips (of The Impossibles).

He subscribes to the same wise words of his spiritual father, Val Doonican, that, \"When you entertain the public, it's no good just having good music or singing, you must also have entertainment value, so people will go home having a good time\".\n\n\n\nSo, can you trust him?

Songs like Tempted, Up the Junction, Cool for Cats and Black Coffee in Bed still find steady air-play on UK and US radio.\n\nIn June of 2005, Squeeze released The Big Squeeze, a compilation of singles and B sides that went straight into the UK chart at Number 8, proving the timeless appeal of their music. During time away from Squeeze, Chris has written with Elton John, Trilok Gurtu, Marti Pellow, Lamont Dozier, Willie Mitchell and many others. In his spare time, Chris organizes writer workshops, which have been an inspiration to everyone that has attended. Last year he hosted a Songwriter Webcast from his studio in Sussex with bands like Turin Brakes and The Webb Brothers. The Broadcast also featured Jane Birkin and Nitin Sawhney. Scripting the lyrics for the film Still Crazy; this won him an Ivor Novello Award, a proud moment for the mantelpiece. The film documented the insane life of a rock band in the 70s. Something he knew a little about! Image hosting by Photobucket Back in 1984, Chris, with his songwriting partner Glenn Tilbrook, wrote a musical called Labelled with Love. It ran for three months in London and this remains one of his fondest memories of working with Glenn. Most recently, Chris has been writing with Wet Wet Wet singer Marti Pellow for his 2nd solo album. This two-year project has given Chris the chance to bring together some of the finest writers, as he did on Marti's Martis first album, Smile. Together, Chris and Marti have composed over 150 new songs with people like Steve Booker, Adam Levy (Norah Jones' guitarist), Amy Wadge, Jim Watson and many more. Chris is working on various projects at the moment: a musical with Guy Barker - Jazz Trumpeter supreme and a record with his friend Matt Deighton from Mother Earth fame.\n\nIn August 2006 Chris released South East Side Story, an acoustic album and DVD that features reworked versions of classic Squeeze songs, and a live performance at the Albany Theatre. This Autumn he also embarks on a UK tour with Marti Pellow. South East Side Story is released on Luna Records, for more details visit http://www.lunarecords.co.uk.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Snow Patrol ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10336343.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Alternative Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Twenty-five years of Snow Patrol: where did it all go right?\n\nGary Lightbody has had plenty opportunity to ponder that over the last couple of years. The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Morgan Finlay ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9929320.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Vancouver,Canada", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Traveling the roads of Europe for fifteen years, Irish-Canadian singer-songwriter Morgan Finlay has woven his talent for melody, poignant observations and passion for humanity into a fan-made success story.

I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent.

When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave.

The last live gig by The Pack took place at a sold out 101 club in Clapham.\n\nBrandon then formed the post punk new wave band Theatre of Hate in 1980 recruiting Stan Stammers on bass guitar, Nigel Preston on drums, Billy Duffy on guitar and John 'Boy' Lennard on saxophone. Theatre of Hate had their largest hit from the Westworld album with the single \"Do You Believe In The Westworld?\", which achieved #40 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1982, while the album rose to #17 in the UK Albums Chart in March 1982.\n\nTheatre of Hate disbanded in 1983. Brandon and Theatre of Hate bassman Stammers were joined by Lascelles James on saxophone and Chris Bell on drums to form Spear of Destiny. The new band adopted a more melodic and less aggressive sound, distancing themselves from post-punk and moving a little more towards mainstream pop.\n\nWhile continuing to explore the political ideas that he wrote about in Theatre of Hate, Brandon's lyrics for Spear of Destiny dealt more frequently with the classic pop themes of love and romance. Many line-up changes followed with the band swelling to a 6 piece and then contracting back to a 4 piece. The band's reputation as a live act never translated itself into record sales, and Spear of Destiny only scored one Top 20 hit.\n\nIn 2003 Brandon did a solo tour as support to The Alarm on their 'Poppyfields' tour. His set included some new material played on an acoustic guitar with electric pick up, as well as some material from his time with Theatre of Hate and Spear of Destiny.\n\nIn recent years he has performed in the punk supergroup, Dead Men Walking, before reforming and touring with Spear Of Destiny in 2007 and 2008.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rye River Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10391622.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.ryeriverband.com\n\nThe Rye River Band are a 5-piece live and recording band from Ireland.\nFormed in Leixlip Co.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week.

Few bands can so smoothly mix dancefloor-savvy elements of reggae, jungle and ska with the rigorous commentary of hip-hop whilst retaining enough grit and aggression to be an active fixture of the UK\u2019s punk scene. Only Sonic Boom Six are propelled by the melodious rapping of Laila K who (characteristically contrary to the stereotype of a young asian female from Hulme) is one of the most incendiary vocalists to ever bounce around a moshpit of Mohawks. A true product of their environment - the sound of a thousand city-centre clubnights and student party mash-ups invigorate the righteous fury of distorted guitars and dubby grooves \u2013 SB6 create a sound as authentic as it is unique.

Arcade Perfect drops on November 12th, 2007 on the band\u2019s own label imprint, Rebel Alliance (distributed by Code 7). Speaking on the new material Laila comments \u201cit\u2019s been the first time we\u2019ve felt like the record speaks for itself whereas in the past our records have kind of been an extension to the live show.\u201d Ben continues \u201cWe\u2019ve spent so much time playing to fresh crowds in across Europe - where they genuinely know nothing about you and you have to entertain non-stop for an hour and a half or more - that our writing was influenced by that vibe. We wanted to keep the inventiveness of our older stuff for the current fans whilst also being able to make a room full of kids in a squat dance their arses off when they hear these songs for the first time.\u201d\n\nThis outlook extends into the band\u2019s distinctive tradition of the mixing the narrative and wordplay of hip-hop with an unflinching commentary of their surroundings that snarls with the studded spirit of 77. \u201cI\u2019ve always been as influenced by rappers lyrically as I have by rock artists\u201d explains Barney, \u201cI\u2019m definitely drawn to the idea of talking directly about an issue rather than shrouding the whole thing in poetry. I think it\u2019s the most effective way to get a point across\u201d.

Rather than avoid the topics of the day, I have decided to face them head on.\u201d\nFrom back alley Bangkok bars to international festival main stages, from the jungles of Panama, the streets of New York to a wide range of venues and podiums across Europe and beyond. From performances and tuition both formal and informal with blues greats, Moroccan gnaoua musicians, Indian Sarod masters and Spanish rock bands, Johns music continues expand from its blues basis.\nA new album is currently in production for release in 2020. Its contents currently remain a secret, although it is rumoured to draw deeply from the rich and varied melting-pot of Johns musical and life experiences. He is not here to mince his words, expect the record to be raw and honest.\nJohn Fairhurst remains probably the only performer ever to have played every single Glastonbury Festival Main Stage in one single day....

The music achieved critical acclaim and airplay across the country and into the US and even Europe. The first single from that album, \u2018Come Right Back To You\u2019 debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul song chart at #23, while the album itself debuted at #11 on the Canadian iTunes Top 200 RnB/Soul chart.\n\nThe success of \u2018My Heart Away\u2019 led to the interest and attention of one of House music\u2019s hardest working artists from Sweden, StoneBridge. The Grammy award-nominated artist, Producer, and DJ has shared his talent on Billboard #1 hits for major artists like Ariana Grande, P!nk, Haley Joelle, Nelly Furtado & many others. One particular song from Avery\u2019s album, \u2018Pieces\u2019, captured the dynamic producer\u2019s imagination and \u2018Pieces \u2013 The Remixes\u2019, released in January 2020, with its already infectious melody and catchy hook, is being played in dance clubs and on dance radio all around the world. In fact, the song debuted on the Billboard Dance Club Song Chart at 50* and has quickly moved within the top 40, widening the appeal of this independent Canadian artist.\n\nThat achievement is merely one of many successes from this teenaged Contemporary Soul/Pop phenomenon. In fact, Canadian, recording artist Avery Raquel, started in the entertainment industry at a very young age. From television, for the likes of DreamWorks, to animation for Disney, voice-over work, commercials and radio, as well as a number of professional stage productions across Canada, Avery\u2019s passion for performing grew. All the while, Avery kept honing her craft as a vocalist of rare talent, which has led to an impressive list of career-accomplishments on her musical resume.\n\nThat talent caught the ears of award-winning Canadian producer/songwriter/musician Greg Kavanagh, in 2017, and their eventual collaboration of work has led to outstanding original songs that not only were featured on \u2018My Heart Away\u2019, but also on her second solo album, \u2018Without A Little Rain\u2019. That album debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul album chart at #31.\n\nBeyond acquiring media attention, Avery\u2019s music consistently receives glowing reviews and continued airplay across Canada, and into the United States, affording her opportunities to perform her music across North America. From New York to Newport to Toronto and beyond, including venues and renowned music festivals, Avery continues to wow audiences with her fresh style and powerful vocal performances.\n\nAvery is compassionate as well, volunteering her time to regularly perform at sports, government, and charity events, donating her talents. She\u2019s even sung the anthem in front of 43,000 people at a Toronto Blue Jays Baseball game.\n\nOf course, she also has a passion for supporting causes close to her heart such as anti-bullying (going into schools talking and performing for students), and music education. To that extent, Heart of Indie Radio in the US, has named a scholarship in her honour. That scholarship, every year for the next 10 years, awards an individual in Canada, and one in the United States, with $500 USD towards their arts or music education.\n\nAvery continues to compose new music, challenging herself to appeal to multiple genres and audiences, and constantly performing and improving her craft.

He was as wild then as he is now, it\u2019s just that on two wheels, Reynolds\u2019 lack of abandon resulted in broken bones, not broken beats. In 1992, he limped off the ramp one last time and soon found himself lost to electronic psychedelia, and thusly one of the West Coast\u2019s finest DJs began his path to the Desert Hearts movement and the hysteria he now conjures with every performance.\n\nNow, a quarter century later, Reynolds has a lifetime\u2019s worth of experience bringing the weird and the wonderful to the dancefloor. He earned his chops up and down the West Coast in the dance scene\u2019s dustier institutions\u2013\u2013Moontribe, Moonshake, LiB\u2013\u2013That\u2019s where he developed his endlessly wide palate, penchant for mysticism, and an understanding that a dance party should be a spiritual experience.\n\n\u201cWhen I DJ, I want people to feel ecstatic, in a zone, in the moment, like the only thing that matters is the dance,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play music that people can dance to, I want to play music that makes people dance. I want it to sound like aliens are about to land on the dancefloor.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, It was an encounter with a plucky bunch of San Diegans barely out of their teens that was the calling Lee Reynolds had spent his whole life working towards. Alongside Mikey Lion, Deep Jesus, Marbs, and Porkchop, Reynolds formed Desert Hearts and the rest is history in motion. Over the past three years of bi-annual renegade ragers and relentless touring, \u201cPapa\u201d Lee Reynolds has developed into the patriarch of the fastest growing and most visible cultural movement in all of stateside dance music.\n\n\u201cMy real role in Desert Hearts is more on a spiritual level, making sure we spread a positive message and do the right thing,\u201d says Reynolds. Wise words, maybe, but behind the decks, Reynolds is a maniacal presence as he channels his past lives, tastes, adventures, and perspectives into a dancefloor magic that captures you upon first beat and does not release: House, techno, acid, and breaks, they\u2019re all conjured up in a plume of purple haze and that little mad bastard is at the center of it all.\n\nDance music now is so often about fast rises and immediate gratification, but Lee Reynolds\u2019 story is a reminder that some beats taste better when slowly fried over the course of 25 years. \u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with this shit forever and I\u2019ve always believed the madness was coming,\u201d says Reynolds. Well, the madness has commenced, and it seems like it\u2019s here for good\u2013\u2013and Lee Reynolds is conducting the score.\n- Jemayel Kh\u00e4w\u00e5ja", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "BLOND:ISH ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380301.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "House, Deep House", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "BLOND:ISH BIO:GRAPHY 2017 By their calculations, Anstascia and Vivie Ann have more than 100 years of raving experience.

Your eyes close, your body grooves to the sounds and the beats and the thuds of the tech house that is now expertly laid out for all to enjoy. Dark and driving, thumping techno is paired with mystical, beautiful, melodic house. That passionately and expertly paired genre bending style can only mean one thing. Marbs has taken the decks. Having grown up in Southern California with the now notoriously known motley crew called Desert Hearts, Marbs, an artistic kid, was primarily influenced by legends like Pink Floyd and Tool, while also listening to underground hip hop, reggae, and rock, displaying his no holds barred love for all genres from an early age. Flash forward to San Francisco's Love Fest, art cars roaming the city, house music spilling from speakers, and Marbs\u2019 musical tastes were forever changed thanks to ruler of the house music game and party guru, Lee Burridge. After years of djing the San Diego, LA, and Burning Man party circuits, the Desert Hearts crew took it upon themselves to throw their own kind of party. One built on love, acceptance, and strictly, House and Techno, their 2012 one time gathering of 200 people in the Mojave (the coldest one ever, we swear!!) has turned into one of the most talked about and adored boutique festivals in the US. None of which could be possible without Marbs, lovingly coined, \"Papa Bear\", he is truly the backbone of the project behind the scenes, where he runs most of the logistics with a steady hand and a humble heart. He\u2019s easily one of the nicest guys on the planet and is the most modest of the crew, which is insane given his endless barrage of talents beyond his musical endeavors.

His focus on house music from the land of funk and disco, was triggered while playing the club and warehouse scene in San Francisco.\n\nAs one of the major players in laying the foundations of a strong West Coast dance scene, Doc has always been a master of mixing the crowd with the music. Neatly avoiding pigeonholing, while embracing a myriad of different styles, his set creates a warm unique vibe of empathy on the dance floor.\n\nDoc's legendary 8 hour sets at Flammable Liquid, Sunday Love, to the most underground lofts, and warehouse parties know no colors, age or sexual orientation. Not only does he regularly devastate dance floors in prestigious clubs like New York's Twilo and Liverpool's Cream, to the smallest loft parties, but he can also send a crowd of ravers into a euphoric groove. That's rare these days in a scene where there are sizable walls between the two ends of the dance music spectrum.\n\nWhile most star DJ's are one-note musicians sticking to a single subgenera of music, Doc' s live sets bring many styles of music as well as people together. In this age of specialized formats among DJ's and producers, what sets Martin apart from his peers is his ability to spin everything from deep house, acid, funk, tribal, and classics in a set, while having it all make sense. Doc is one of the most sought after DJs in America. Constantly touring, he can be found playing records everywhere from England to New Zealand, and everywhere in between. As the first West Coast DJ to ever hold many residencies in New York, he continues to spread the gospel according to Doc.\n\nNow residing in L.A. he has begun to spread his vibe through making music in the studio as well as playing it. Remixing The Mighty Dub Katz projects for Nervous Records, as well as original tracks for Moonshine, Shaboom, 99 North, and the ever growing Leaf Recordings to name a few.\n\nDoc's magic continues to grow, whether it is on the turntables or in the studio. He is a future legend of house and loved by thousands all over the world. Music over hype will always be Doc's message of love.

But as anyone who's been to Nevada's Black Rock Desert will tell you, Burning Man years are like dog years, and by that measure, Blond:ish has been together for a lifetime. As a youngster growing up in Canada, Vivie Ann aspired to be a computer hacker. Equally unique in her goals, Anstascia sought the acceptance of nerds. Both say they failed miserably. Eventually, their broken-heart trails converged and they created a midweek party in Montreal. Every Wednesday, they would promote, party, and DJ at the nightclub Cherry.

From The Wreckage glowed with a rootsy golden tone that encompassed everything from indie-folk, to alt-country to blues-rock to Southern psychedelia. Its creators, touring musician turned songwriter and producer Dwight Baker and singer-songwriter Patty Lynn, began making music together on a lark, never dreaming anything would come of it. Baker describes it as \u201ckind of like what happens when two friends hold hands and jump in a freezing lake just to see what it feels like.\u201d Thanks to the undeniable chemistry between the pair, the music took on a life of its own and The Wind and The Wave soon found themselves with a major-label record deal, embarking on U.S. headlining tours, having their songs appear in such TV shows as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and racking up millions of plays on Spotify and Apple Music. The band also earned itself a rabid following, with fans especially enamored of Lynn\u2019s feisty vocals and brutally personal lyrics about challenging relationships with lovers and family members as well as her relationship with herself. \u201cPeople really treasure that album,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe got tons of letters from people saying it saved their life. They\u2019re people who are conflicted and searching and they connect with Patty\u2019s lyrics more than anything.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for The Wind and The Wave to make their second album, Baker says he and Lynn felt \u201csome bit of an obligation to deliver that again.\u201d The band definitely delivered on their sophomore album, Happiness Is Not A Place, and the result is the sound of a band that has stretched itself and grown. Lynn managed to dig a little deeper with her lyrics, exploring her difficult feelings on commitment, and family, while acknowledging her own frantic mind. And the band\u2019s sonic palette is nervier, thanks to the album being recorded live by producer Butch Walker. \u201cTo me, it sounds reckless with a rock and roll spirit and attitude, an \u2018I don\u2019t give a fuckedness,\u2019 if you will. I wanted it to make sense to our fans, but to feel like a step forward musically. And I think we accomplished that. It\u2019s really rough around the edges, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency and pent-up stuff that probably came from both Patty and my nervousness about making a record with an outside producer.\u201d\n\nAfter being dropped by two major labels, all expectations and second guesses went flying out the window. The band\u2019s third full length album, Human Beings Let You Down, was a record made in hotels and backstage dressing rooms across the US. \u201cGetting married was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Lynn, \u201cBut it also brought out a lot, good and bad, and therapy helped me work through it. That\u2019s what the song Neon Prayer Flags is all about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta tough to be Patty, or anyone in her life, because if something\u2019s amiss, she\u2019s going to write about it. And you\u2019re going to know it\u2019s about you, and you\u2019re going to feel weird about it,\u201d Baker says with a chuckle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in the line of fire. Patty and I are two people who, while we strive to be joyful and positive, can be very much morose and negative, and that definitely comes out in the songs.\u201d\n\nThe band is currently working on their fourth album, and will embark on a series of acoustic mini tours in 2020, called The Feelings Club.", "otherInfo": "Hey friends and fam!

Her work is at once deeply personal and socially conscious, seriously funny and derisively tragic. Over five albums and a decade of recording, the Denver-born songwriter/guitarist/singer has tackled such topics as the death penalty, anorexia, shoplifting, reproduction, the French resistance movement, adolescence, and the Christian right. Did we mention love? Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.\n\nWhile her songs cover a huge amount of ground, they all have benefit greatly from Jill's subtle intelligence and skillful light-handedness. No sloganeering flag-and-fist waving here, but rather story songs about human beings, real and imagined, which allow us to step back from the issue, be it personal or social, and relate to it as we would a close friend.\n\nTo see Jill live and in concert is a rare treat. It is on stage that she is most comfortable, most powerful, and where the delicacy and range of her work can be best appreciated. She entertains, amuses, provokes, and more often then not, takes her audiences on an emotional roller coaster, from comedy to pathos in a few bars of music.\n\nJill began playing guitar when she joined the Junior High School band. She never learned to read music, though, and faked her way through rehearsals and performances by playing by ear. As she began writing songs, it was very clear to Jill this was becoming more than a teenage hobby. Music was serious stuff. She played in a variety of funk and rock bands in Colorado, and eventually made her first, Todd Rundgren-produced, album for MCA, Things Here Are Different.\n\nBut success did not knock on her door until three years later, when Atlantic Records released her MTV staple and national top 20 hit, I Kissed A Girl. \"That song was a double-edged sword for me,\" Jill Says. \"It was perceived as a novelty hit, but on the other hand it was the first song with an overtly gay topic to be aired on Top 40 radio. I am quite proud of that.\" The self-titled album also yielded another hit song, Supermodel, included in the Clueless soundtrack.\n\nThe song also jumpstarted her live music career in a big way, and since then she's had the honor to induct Neil Diamond in the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, to share the stage with the likes of Neil Young (at his yearly Bridge School benefit concerts), fellow activists Billy Bragg & Steve Earle, and Waren Zevon. Quite the serious guitar player, she even toured the world as lead guitarist in Lloyd Cole's band a few years back.\n\nSince then, she has made four more critically acclaimed albums, Happy Town, Pink Pearl, Underdog Victorious, and 2009's California Years, which Jill released on her own record label, Pinko Records, after collecting over $85,000 from fans who funded the project.\n\nA veritable gypsy, Jill divides her time between a busy touring schedule and a variety of other projects. She has played the role of political troubadour for NPR stations across the country and for Air America Radio. She also served as songwriter/composer for the hit Nickelodeon network show Unfabulous during that show's three-season run. She composed the music for the off-Broadway show Prozak and the Platypus and co-starred in the Eric Schaeffer film Mind the Gap.\n\nIn the words of New York Times pop music critic Jon Pareles, \"Jill Sobule can claim her place among the stellar New York singer-songwriters of the last decade. Topical, funny and more than a little poignant ... grown-up music for an adolescent age.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "King Goon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ricky Valido ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390485.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "On Tour Now!\nVisit RickyValido.com\nhttps://twitter.com/RickyValido\ninstagram.com/RickyValido", "otherInfo": "Ricky Valido will be airing live this Saturday May 23rd for a Memorial Day Salute!

That extends to countless sold out shows and festivals everywhere from Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, and Summer Camp to All Good Music Festival and High Sierra Music Festival as well as 16 consecutive years of themed Halloween concerts.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re listening to us, I want your mind to be taken away from wherever you are during the day and into some other place,\u201d states Dave. \u201cIt\u2019s all about that.\u201d\n\nAfter quietly building a diehard and devoted following, 2016 represented a watershed year for the musicians. They welcomed Lyle and Drew into the fold and released Totem, which drew acclaim from Relix, AXS, 303 Magazine, and many others. For the first time, The Motet sold out the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater\u2014the holy grail venue of their hometown\u2014cataloged on Live at Red Rocks.

Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet players Eric Bloom and Rashawn Ross deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy oftheir incendiary live show.\n\nProduced by Lettuce and Co-Produced recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on\nCrush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms\nstyle, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the\ngroove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\n\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \u201cSilverdome\u201d or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \u201cOresteia,\u201d Lettuce maneuver through Crush\u2019s kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \u201cMore so than any of the records we\u2019ve done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cInstead of going at it like, \u2018Here\u2019s a melody, now here\u2019s a guitar solo, here\u2019s another\nmelody, here\u2019s a sax solo,\u2019 everyone\u2019s leaning on each other in a way that\u2019s completely unspoken. It\u2019s all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee\nas undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage!in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\n\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act. And in making Crush, the band had no trouble harnessing the spirit of their explosive live show. \u201cSome of these shows we\u2019ve played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it\u2019s like you go home a different person,\u201d says Coomes. \u201cI\u2019m sure\nremembering those moments in our minds and our hearts helped bring out something special when we were recording these new songs.\u201d\n\nSo while Crush offers everything from all-out party jams to headphone-ready journeys into space funk, each track was born from an unabashed joy and love of live performance. \u201cThat energy we get when it\u2019s prime time and we\u2019re about to go onstage and we\u2019re just excited beyond belief\u2014that all came out on this new album,\u201d says Deitch. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the band is rising, and it\u2019s a really beautiful thing.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/lfot-summer-camp-weekend-pass"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cut Killer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6378432.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Electronic", "Time": "9:59 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cut Killer is the French's answer to Funkmaster Flex.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island.

Pianist Kenny Hensley learned to fly planes and enrolled in kung-fu training in China, while bassist Chris Zasche packed up a camper and went off the grid in the Canadian Rockies. Drummer Tyler Williams put down stakes across the country and immersed himself in the burgeoning music scene in Richmond, Va., while vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Charity Rose Thielen honed her compositional skills by writing for such legends as Mavis Staples.\n\nAfter his own cross-country trip to reconnect with family and friends, vocalist/guitarist Jonathan Russell traveled to Haiti and found inspiration working with the non-profit Artists For Peace And Justice. \"When I found out we were going to have a significant amount of time off, I saw it as an opportunity to touch base again -- to listen to what other people were saying and what they were going through,\" he says. \"I really wanted to make sure that I reconnected with a world that was starting to feel farther and farther away.\"\n\nWhen they regrouped last summer in Stinson Beach, Ca., to start writing together again, \"it almost felt like we were a new band, trying things we hadn't tried,\" Zasche recalls. \"We stayed at a bungalow on the beach. We'd wake up, have coffee and go boogie boarding. We were ready and excited to be back together.\"\n\nThat renewed sense of purpose can be felt throughout Signs Of Light, the group's first release for Warner Bros. Records. \"This album isn't about us now having achieved our dreams,\" says Thielen. \"The day we started being able to live off our art was the day we achieved our dreams, in my mind. This is the album where we really fell into our true voices as those artists.\"\n\nRecorded in Nashville with producer Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Cage The Elephant), Signs Of Light, crackles with the upbeat, sing-a-long energy of the Head And The Heart's finest work. Lead single \"All We Ever Knew,\" which was written during the \"Let's Be Still\" era but never captured to the band's satisfaction until now, is sure to be a crowd-pleaser, while \"Turn It Around\" seems primed to be a future concert staple, matching its inspirational message with a lush and multi-layered soundscape.\n\nThroughout, the colors are brighter, the electric guitars are louder and the musical touchstones more universal. The propulsive, smile-inducing ode to Los Angeles \"City Of Angels\" and the head-nodding \"Rhythm & Blues\" nod to classic Fleetwood Mac, while the organ-flecked \"Dreamer\" is a timeless-sounding ballad that could have been beamed straight out of an old jukebox.\n\n\"Jay was really adamant about getting a great performance,\" group member Jonathan Russell says. \"We have all the tools in the world to make something sound real or more excitable, but it's never really as true as the band in the room for the whole take. 'City Of Angels' - we had previously re-cut that song and played it so many times. But within two takes in Nashville, we nailed it. It felt like we were playing on a massive stage in front of tons of people.\"\n\nElsewhere, Thielen's \"Library Magic\" could almost be seen as a letter to the other five members, acknowledging the ups-and-downs of life in a successful band while celebrating the unique and constantly evolving bond between them. \"I wrote that song after having our first real time off as a band,\" she says. \"It touches on the storied relationships between band members trying to survive living in a van off of accelerated time and gas station crafts for years straight, but it also applies to any of life's relationships.\"\n\nThe Head And The Heart's 2011 self-titled debut album captured a nascent but undeniable creative partnership between six strangers thrown together by little more than a shared love of music. It became one of Sub Pop Records' best-selling debut releases ever, and rocketed the band to acclaim well beyond its then-home base in Seattle. The formative experiences that followed both on and off the stage heavily informed the 2013 follow-up \"Let's Be Still,\" which continues to remind Russell of \"the stale beer, bleach and potato chips from all the venues we saw once this became our livelihood.\"\n\nOn Signs Of Light, that gamut of emotions is felt most deeply on the Josiah Johnson-penned title track, which none of the other members had ever heard until they happened to walk in on him playing it over and over at the piano during pre-production in El Paso, Texas. \"It was one of those moments where no one talks,\" Russell remembers. \"No one needs the chords; no one is looking up. You simply pick up your instrument and play. The next thing you know, nearly 10 minutes have gone by and you have no idea how or why or what just happened.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tangent ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10369712.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "This is not a single niche band!

In all he does so with restraint, whether on country tinged acoustic ballads (the excellent \"Amen\") or aching confession-drenched numbers\"[1] \"Battered Wooden Body\" was recorded in Oxford, Mississippi at Tweed Recording Studio and was engineered by Andrew Ratcliffe whose discography includes (The Black Crows, The Damnwells, American Aquarium)\n\nIn 2012, Shallow left A Few Good Liars and started writing and recording songs that would later be released as his first solo self-titled album, Travis Shallow, to regional critical acclaim in the southeastern United States.\n\nShallow went back to Tweed Recording Studio with Andrew Ratcliffe engineering to record his solo debut album.

Claude VonStroke's 'Who's Afraid of Detroit?' was one of the biggest tracks of 2006 and the label it came out on is Dirtybird Records, the Bay Area brainchild of VonStroke and DJ/producer Justin Martin. VonStroke and Martin have been injecting avarian squelch, funk and swagger into the tech house template for just over a year now, but while VonStroke was 2006's unofficial best newcomer, don't be surprised if Martin doesn't fly the coop soon too.\n\nIt might be a fresh sound, but Martin is not exactly a spring chicken. He's actually been releasing records since 2003 \u2013 his first single was 'The Sad Piano' issued on Ben Watt's London label Buzzin' Fly. Its simplicity and groove made it a favourite of DJs along the lines of Derrick Carter, Pete Tong and Mark Farina, while Charles Webster\u2019s classic remix of the cut even found favour with the Germans, popping up on Steve Bug's 'Bugnology'. Since then Martin has racked up two more twelves on Buzzin' Fly and a couple of jacking house tracks and remixes on labels such as Classic and Freerange. He also promises an artist album in 2007.\n\nWhile San Francisco might not thought be thought of as a dance hotbed, there's always been enough going on to turn the most curious heads onto the culture. The early drum n bass scene turned Martin away from jazz and hip hop and onto the rave culture of the nineties, a short sharp shock which inspired him to take up DJing and producing. But the truth is Martin had always been musical \u2013 as a child he studied the saxophone and classical piano, a musicality which shows in both his productions and DJ sets. \"Justin started playing the pots and pans at the age of 2,\" his MySpace puts it. \"Now he is a DJ.\"\n\nMartin's rise has been prominent enough to even make an older tradition of West Coast house take notice. He's also a new face on Om Records, home to big West Coast househeads such as Miguel Migs, Andy Caldwell and Fred Everything. Martin\u2019s remix of Iz & Diz's 'Magnificent' is pretty slamming, and the label has also chosen him to mix a volume in their latest compilation series 'Om: Winter Sessions', on which he spins tracks and remixes from Switch, Jesse Rose, and Phonique. Not exactly a typical Om sound, but it\u2019s nice to see San Francisco moving forward.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anna ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop Folk, Jazz, Folk, Chanson, Pop, Chanson Fran\u00e7aise", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/id1031943288\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Anna.official\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/annaBirdfly", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Head ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7633725.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "La biographie est en cours de construction.

Jeremy Sole is on a mission to show how music is a singular universal language, and that each culture\u2019s rhythms and melodies are no more than slang--different accents of the same mother tongue. His DJ sets, remixes and original compositions juxtapose world sounds and experimental beats into a sonic ritual - a celebration of life out loud. As a teenager, Chicago-born Jeremy Sole's loft parties were a culture clash of creative urban youth. Jeremy's upbringing was seeped in the rich Chicago history of Blues, Jazz, Disco and Funk - and he reveled in that sacred space where they all blend together. He matured as a turntablist in Jazz, Dub, and experimental hybrid bands. Meanwhile his obsession grew to include music from every corner of the world. In 2001 Sole moved to Los Angeles, and with his broad musical palette, felt right at home in the spiciest melting pot in the country. As Co-Founder and resident deejay of \"AFRO FUNK\u00c9\", Sole and his partners have drawn a loyal crowd every week for the past 9 years. This is his arena for Afrobeat, Latin, Brazilian, Indian, Jamaican and other authentic and remixed world rhythms. Hundreds of international guests have joined them, from deejays Chebi Sabbah and Cut Chemist to impromptu jam sessions with Zap Mama and Stevie Wonder. Collaborating with Eric \"Wiseacre\" Tucker, Sole returns to his underground roots with \"theLIFT\" - roaming monthly, all-night warehouse events with heavyweights like Bonobo, Nickodemus and King Britt gracing their stages. What started at his small downtown loft, grew to well over 1,500 people by their one-year anniversary. Since then, theLIFT has taken place in Miami, NYC, Palm Springs, Portugal, London, and San Francisco. Jeremy has had the honor of sharing the stage and the studio with hundreds of his creative inspirations, including Roy Ayers, Ben Harper, Tony Allen, Stevie Wonder, Seu Jorge, Fat Freddy's Drop, Parliament, Lee Scratch Perry, and Quantic. Gilles Peterson (BBC Radio1), widely known as the most influential tastemaker of our generation, listed Sole as \"#2 DJ OF THE YEAR 2011\" at Peterson's prestigious \"Worldwide Awards\". Sole's DJ performance at Coachella 2012 played a large part in further embedding his name as a pioneer in the burgeoning \"Global Bass\" scene. Sole was the last DJ to open for Ray Charles, deejayed for Sly Stone's birthday party, and had the distinct honor of mixing at the California Democratic Party's Election Night Celebration - playing for over 10,000 people at the exact moment when Barack Obama officially became the 44th President. Sole spent most of 2006 in the studio producing with Ms. Lauryn Hill. After hearing him mix, she asked if he had ever considered getting into radio, \"because this is the music the people need to hear\u201d. A few months later, KCRW called to ask him that exact same question, and he agreed to join the ranks of what New York Times dubbed the \"most influential radio station in the country,\". You can tune into Sole every Wednesday at midnight in Los Angeles on 89.9 KCRW (or worldwide, streaming and archived at www.kcrw.com/jeremysole). Sole has also produced official remixes for BECK (US), FEMI KUTI (Nigeria), NATURAL SELF (UK), NOVALIMA (Peru), JAZZANOVA (Germany), THIEVERY CORPORATION (US), ROCKY DAWUNI (Ghana), QUANTIC (Colombia) and others. In 2011, EMI enlist Sole to remix DAVID BOWIE'S \"Golden Years\". The result features Ticklah (of Antibalas and Amy Winehouse) with the Daptone musicians for an all-analog reworking of the 1976 classic. In Sole's most ambitious project to date, he enlisted some of LA's most sought-after musicians to birth an organic, turntable-led, 9-piece ensemble featuring steel drums, a 4-piece horn section, violinist and more. This massive undertaking he calls \"MUSAICS\", a musical mosaic of many genres interlaced into a spiritual dancefloor ritual. Their debut concert was held at the renowned Getty Museum, and a live album has been recorded to crystalize the improvisational style they embody. More on that in the days to come... ----------------------------- \"Jeremy Sole was a revelation.\" - Gilles Peterson \"If I was a DJ full time, I would most likely spin like Jeremy Sole.

Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet players Eric Bloom and Rashawn Ross deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy oftheir incendiary live show.\n\nProduced by Lettuce and Co-Produced recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on\nCrush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms\nstyle, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the\ngroove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\n\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \u201cSilverdome\u201d or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \u201cOresteia,\u201d Lettuce maneuver through Crush\u2019s kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \u201cMore so than any of the records we\u2019ve done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cInstead of going at it like, \u2018Here\u2019s a melody, now here\u2019s a guitar solo, here\u2019s another\nmelody, here\u2019s a sax solo,\u2019 everyone\u2019s leaning on each other in a way that\u2019s completely unspoken. It\u2019s all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee\nas undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage!in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\n\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act. And in making Crush, the band had no trouble harnessing the spirit of their explosive live show. \u201cSome of these shows we\u2019ve played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it\u2019s like you go home a different person,\u201d says Coomes. \u201cI\u2019m sure\nremembering those moments in our minds and our hearts helped bring out something special when we were recording these new songs.\u201d\n\nSo while Crush offers everything from all-out party jams to headphone-ready journeys into space funk, each track was born from an unabashed joy and love of live performance. \u201cThat energy we get when it\u2019s prime time and we\u2019re about to go onstage and we\u2019re just excited beyond belief\u2014that all came out on this new album,\u201d says Deitch. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the band is rising, and it\u2019s a really beautiful thing.", "otherInfo": "1/24/2020 Replay Livestream: https://nugs.tv/default.aspx"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dirtwire ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10066863.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "World Fusion, Blues-rock, Electronica", "Time": "10:22 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dirtwire sits on the front porch of Americana\u2019s future, conjuring up a whirlwind of sound using traditional instrumentation, world percussion, soundscapes, and electronic beats.

These newly mixed and mastered recordings feature the original line-up: Warren Haynes, Allen Woody and Matt Abts. \u201cHaving listened to them recently, for the first time in decades, a big smile came over my face. These recordings capture the rawness and excitement of the earliest stage of Gov\u2019t Mule,\u201d explains Haynes.\n\nRecorded during the infancy of Gov\u2019t Mule, the demos heard on The Tel-Star Sessions are from a time when Mule was an adventurous side project, formed during a year when Warren Haynes and Allen Woody had some down time from their work with the Allman Brothers Band. Becoming one of the most enduring, respected and active bands in the world was the furthest thing from the band's imagination; the plan was to record a low-budget album and play a few shows. It's now clear that they had stumbled upon something special, but at that point Mule was an experimental rock trio: Haynes, Woody and drummer Matt Abts, who Haynes brought in after playing with him in the Dickey Betts Band. Fans will love the chance to hear their early improvisational interplay, an impressive skill that has since become a signature of Gov't Mule's albums and live shows.\n\nCollaborating with Allman Brothers sound engineer Bud Snyder, and taking legendary producer Tom Dowd's advice to record all instruments simultaneously live in a room, Gov't Mule holed up in the Tampa-area studio. They recorded a mix of early originals such as \u201cBlind Man In The Dark,\u201d \u201cMonkey Hill,\u201d and \u201cLeft Coast Groovies\u201d along with covers by ZZ Top (\u201cJust Got Paid\u201d), Free (\u201cMr. Big\u201d), and Willie Dixon (\u201cThe Same Thing\u201d). Says Warren, \u201cAlong with our discussions about the \u2018power trio\u2019 being missing from the current musical landscape were the discussions of how the sound of the bass guitar had gotten progressively \u2018cleaner\u2019 since the \u201980s (or late \u201970s), and how that affected the overall feeling of the music.\u201d Their influences leaned heavily on the likes of Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience and ZZ Top, but Mule\u2019s search to bring back a familiar sound is mingled with grunge and alt-rock influences that had just emerged in the early-mid \u201890s. Little did they know that the magic created during these sessions would spark such a prolific musical journey.\n\nThe band recorded three increasingly ambitious studio albums and performed countless shows before Woody died in August, 2000. After briefly pausing to ponder their next move, Haynes and Abts began recording The Deep End, two CDs featuring guest bassists, ranging from the Who\u2019s John Entwistle to the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019ve done collectively has led up to where we are now,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut those Deep End sessions, and the experience of playing with so many bassists and adapting to different sounds and approaches had a profound effect on Gov\u2019t Mule and what we\u2019ve done since.\u201d\n\nDanny Louis, a longtime collaborator, became a full-time member of Gov\u2019t Mule in 2001, and the group has been a four-piece ever since. Bassist Jorgen Carlsson has been with the group since 2008, solidifying the lineup.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the music we\u2019re doing now is very similar to the music we were making in the earliest years with the obvious exception that we are no longer a trio,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cIn some ways we\u2019ve come full circle and in other ways it only makes sense if you step back and connect the dots. And that seems right to me. You want to keep growing and you never want to be static, or done changing.\u201d\n\nWarren Haynes\u2019 unparalleled ability to bring together different musicians into a cohesive whole or to pull off epic musical happenings is one of the many reasons why Haynes stands apart from the many great front men and guitarists who have graced the musical landscape. Combined with his guitar and vocal mastery, these skills have made him an in-demand presence and indispensible musical ally for many.\n\nGov't Mule has showcased its virtuosity, intelligence and breadth for more than two decades, which have encompassed 15 studio and live albums, millions of album and track sales and thousands of performances. The band has become a human encyclopedia of timeless American music while adding to that canon with their signature sound.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/lfot-summer-camp-weekend-pass"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Storm Large ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7851557.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Storm Large", "Time": "10:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Storm Large: musician, actor, playwright, author, awesome.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mark Meadows ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390172.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Jazz, Soul, R&b, Funk", "Time": "10:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Recently named both \u201cArtist of the Year\u201d and \u201cComposer of the Year\u201d by Washington DC\u2019s City Paper, Mark G.

It speaks to our truest selves, binds us together with the ones we love, and brings out the best part of who we are. Bobby Jo Valentine is a singer/songwriter who chases after this particular kind of music. He writes songs that travel light, but that \u201cgrow deeper and deeper with each further listen\u201d, the music publication Soundtrack to My Day describes. The poetic nature and focus of his stories and songs is something that, along with notable awards, has resulted in an incredibly loyal following of true patrons to his art, supporting Bobby in every way as he seeks to write more music that means something good, and sounds like the beautiful, terrifying world that we live in.\n\nHope-folk. Soul-pop. Poetic rock. Bobby Jo Valentine\u2019s music exists outside the lines of any genre, but the music\u2019s thoughtful lyrics and catchy melodies reach listeners on all paths of life. The authentic, universal, uncanny nature of his songs have won him Song of the Year at West Coast Songwriter\u2019s Association three times \u2013 in 2011, 2015, and 2017. He\u2019s sold 18,000 albums and performed more than 1,000 concerts\u2014all without a record label\u2014and all because of devoted groups of fans and friends who grow in number after every concert.\n\nHis wide range of expression has made it hard for the industry to package, but it\u2019s the same reason his songs are gaining a loyal following around the nation. A few songs have broken through the static. Bobby\u2019s music has appeared on radio and television, including a commercial for the recent Ford Fusion \u00a9, ABC\u2019s The Morning Blend, and the award winning film The Groom\u2019s Cake. His music has received airplay from KGO, KRSH, and other radio stations nationwide.\n\nBorn into a Baptist church of strict lines and sharp edges, and coming out of that culture to discover who he really is, Bobby is now a believer of a different sort: a believer in the wild, strange, beautiful nature of the world. Faith has come to mean something much deeper, wider, and less cut-and-dried than when he started. Now, Bobby finds that he often has more to learn from the people who don\u2019t believe as he does than from those who do. Along with theatres, house concerts, and many other venues, churches around the nation frequently invite Bobby to offer his stories and songs, challenging us to question why we believe what we do and, most importantly, how that helps us be better humans in the world around us. Among others, he has been invited to perform for The Wild Goose Festival, the national Gay Christian Network conference, the international 2016 Emerge conference, the Kinship Festival, and the 2016 UCC Gathering in Southern California. He is ecstatic any time he can discuss the big questions, challenge the easy answers, and inspire people to move closer to love.\n\nSpeaking of love, Bobby loves a good love song, and is in great demand as a performer for weddings gay and straight, all over the country. He was named \u201cBest in 2015\u201d for ceremony music by The Knot, and has received more than 35 five-star reviews for his romantic, soulful singing.\n\nBobby is a proud supporter of equal rights for all people. He believes that we\u2019re all in this together; that \u201cthe arc of the universe is long, but bends toward justice\u201d; and that real justice means justice for everyone. Bobby is a constant supporter of LGBT rights and performs at Pride festivals and benefits and for LGBT youth programs all over the US. He has also been invited to perform for many child protection, child homelessness, and domestic violence prevention non-profits, including the national Safe Place Network.\n\nWhen he isn\u2019t touring the nation singing his songs for everyone who will listen, Bobby lives on the windy coastline of Northern California. His new albums \u201cFox Eyes, Whale Heart\u201d and \"Maybe Stars\" are available worldwide on iTunes and on his website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Michelle Malone ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9117156.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Southern Rock, Alternative Bluesrock, Rock, Alternative Rock, Blues, Folk Acoustic Rock, Empowering Americana, Americana & Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "SHORT BIO:\n\n\"Pure, unfiltered Georgia soul lined at the edges with bluesy Americana and primal rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2026Wait until you hear Slings & Arrows, music fans.

She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins. Michelle's latest recording, Slings and Arrows, was released March 2018 and debuted at #8 on the Billboard Blues charts.\n\nFor tour dates, info and booking or, please visit www.michellemalone.com/contact", "otherInfo": "Join me for a Facebook live stream concert! 7pm eastern standard time at Michelle Malone Music!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Illicit Ghost ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389092.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Indie Alt Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ARTIST | PRODUCER | SONGWRITER | VIOLINIST\n\nFollow Illicit Ghost:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/illicitghost\nhttps://www.facebook.com/illicitghost\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/2CQiz8RKaVtO87GvUKnZ0r?si=nZdKayOgSYS1gphZ4hED7w", "otherInfo": "I'm hosting artist interviews each Saturday with musicians who are featured on my Anti-Anxiety Spotify playlist.

Newly signed to Rounder Records\u2014and named the 2019 Emerging Act of the Year by Americana Music Association\u2014the husband-and-wife team of Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount-Trotter deliver a dynamic sound that joyfully blends Southern soul with elements of gospel, country, rock-and-roll, and blues. Also known for their phenomenal live show, the Nashville-based duo are now gearing up to make their Rounder debut with a sophomore album showcasing their boundless energy and tremendous generosity as songwriters and performers.\n\nDespite the deep sense of communion that infuses their music, Michael and Tanya hail from wildly different backgrounds. Originally from just outside Washington, D.C., Tanya discovered her supreme vocal skills at a young age and promptly pursued a career in music and acting. Meanwhile, Michael grew up in Cleveland and D.C., spending part of his childhood in homeless shelters and later enlisting in the U.S. Army. While stationed in one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s palaces several years after 9/11, he gained access to a piano and quickly captivated his fellow troops with his powerful vocal presence. Soon tasked with writing and performing songs in memoriam to his unit\u2019s fallen soldiers, Michael cultivated a distinct songwriting voice that he further developed upon returning home. After he and Tanya shared the stage at a music festival, the two began creating music together, eventually marrying and forming The War And Treaty. Their EP Down to the River arrived in July 2017, and the duo made their full-length debut with Healing Tide\u2014a widely acclaimed effort. The Associated Press called them, \u201c\u2026a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together,\u201d while Billboard went on to claim that, \u201cThe music world\u2026has definitely shown that it\u2019s ready to love The War and Treaty.\u201d\n\nThe War And Treaty have shared two new tracks from their forthcoming album that bring even more depth and dimension to their music. With its spellbinding intensity, \u201cJealousy\u201d unfolds in a masterfully orchestrated sound that merges soaring harmonies and kinetic beats, symphonic strings and scorching guitar work. And on \u201cHustlin\u2019,\u201d cascading piano tones and gently lilting rhythms build a beautiful contrast to the song\u2019s moody meditation on perseverance and grit. Along with completing the follow-up to Healing Tide, The War And Treaty spent much of 2019 touring with the likes of Brandi Carlile and Jason Isbell, as well as joining the legendary Al Green for a run of dates at such iconic venues as Radio City Music Hall.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alicia Witt ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10098214.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Alicia Witt has a passion for connecting with her fans. \u201cThe thing I love the most is when people come up to me after a show and they tell me that a song perfectly describes a situation they\u2019re going through,\u201d says the singer, songwriter, pianist and acclaimed actor, who is readying the release of Revisionary History, her first full-length studio LP.\n\nWitt\u2019s new album is full of songs like that: nine of them, to be exact, that deal in themes of heartbreak, loyalty and the amazing power that comes with finding your own voice \u2014and using it. \u201cThis record is probably the most personal thing that I\u2019ve put out,\u201d says Witt, who released a self-titled EP in 2009 and the full-length Live at Rockwood in 2012, in between parts in films and on TV in an acting career that began with her debut in the David Lynch sci-fi classic Dune in 1984, when she was 7.\n\nFor all the autobiographical touches on Revisionary History, it\u2019s also a collection of deeply relatable songs. The reflective piano ballad \u201cFriend\u201d opens the album with Witt sifting through feelings of attraction for someone she knows should be just a pal and not a lover, while the aching vocal showcase \u201cConsolation Prize\u201d pairs torchy piano with taut electric guitar accents as Witt muses over the ways in which we edit our pasts to fit the present. Revisionary history, indeed \u2014 the album title comes from a lyric in that song.\n\n\u201cWe can constantly be revising how we remember things, and maybe that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d says Witt, whose TV credits include The Sopranos, Friday Night Lights and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s how we move on.\u201d\n\nProduced by Ben Folds, Revisionary History was years in the making. Some of the songs date back to the mid-\u201900s, which gave her plenty of time to hone them in concert before heading to Folds\u2019 studio in Nashville, where she recorded the album in two week-long chunks in the spring and late fall of 2013.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got such a unique and specific vision for how those songs should best be presented,\u201d Witt says of Folds. \u201cI had no doubt that he was going to bring to it his own vision for the sound of each song, but he also wanted it to be a truthful reflection of what I do. The record sounds very much like me.\u201d\n\nWitt credits Folds for digging into the essence of each song for musical arrangements that sometimes brought out their hidden sides: the folky stomp on \u201cBlind,\u201d for example, highlighted the rootsy touches in a song Witt had been performing for years, while the mournful trumpet and marching drumbeat perfectly captured the mood on \u201cDown,\u201d a tune inspired by the smart but troubled character Witt played on Season Five of the Emmy-nominated FX series Justified, featuring the Emmy-nominated New York rapper and actor T.O.N.E-z\n\n\u201cWhen I heard it all put together, it made me cry,\u201d Witt says. \u201cAt the end, when the trumpet comes in, it sounds like a soul making its way up.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the girl-power anthem \u201cAbout Me,\u201d which shows the influence of Folds and Billy Joel in the robust piano and Witt\u2019s defiant determined vocals; or the lush, sultry \u201960s-style pop tune \u201cTheme From Pasadena,\u201d which Witt wrote with Folds for the movie Cold Turkey (Witt starred opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the indie drama, which was originally to be called Pasadena). In fact, Revisionary History boasts such an array of sounds and styles that there\u2019s no pigeonholing Witt as a musician.\n\n\u201cI love all different types of music, so the songs that I come up with and am drawn to when I\u2019m writing are naturally all over the place,\u201d says Witt, whose movie credits include 88 Minutes with Al Pacino and Two Weeks Notice with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt has been a music lover since she was a little girl growing up in Worcester, Mass. She began playing piano when she was 7, competing in international piano competitions into her teen years. After she moved to Los Angeles at 14, she supported herself by playing in the lobby lounge of the Beverly Wilshire hotel until she landed her first regular acting job on the CBS show Cybil when she was 16. It took a few more years before she began consistently writing her own songs, and it wasn\u2019t until 2008 that she started performing them. Her first gig was opening for Jimmy Webb at a benefit in New York. Moving from standards and show tunes to original songs was a big leap for Witt.\n\n\u201cThere was a considerable fear factor,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an actor doing theater and doing live television, it wasn\u2019t about performing for people. It was about performing my own music. That\u2019s incredibly vulnerable.\u201d\n\nWitt\u2019s fears that audiences wouldn\u2019t respond proved very much unfounded, and the vulnerability of opening up to strangers helped her make the all-important connection that turned them into fans. 'The most that I can hope for is telling these stories that are incredibly personal, but saying them in a way that somebody else can relate to their own experiences,\" says Witt.\n\nbio:\n\nAlicia Witt has had a 3-decade long career, starting with her acting debut in David Lynch\u2019s classic \u2018Dune\u2019.\n\nWitt was most recently seen on Season 4 of the Emmy-award winning Showtime series \u2018House of Lies\u2019 opposite Don Cheadle. This past season, Alicia also appeared on the new DirecTv series \u2018The Kingdom\u2019, on the hit CBS show \u2018Elementary\u2019, and in 2015 in the new TNT series \u2018The Librarians\u2019, a role which she will be reprising on Season 2.\n\nIn 2014, Alicia joined the 5th Season of Emmy-award winning FX series \u2018Justified\u2019 with Timothy Olyphant. Alicia played Wendy Crowe, the smart and sexy paralegal sister of crime lord Darryl Crowe (Michael Rapaport) who takes matters into her own hands to bring him to justice in the Season 5 finale. Last summer she appeared at the Geffen Playhouse in the Los Angeles debut of Tony-nominated Neil Labute play \u2018reasons to be pretty\u2019. The four-hander also starred Amber Tamblyn, Shawn Hatosy and Nick Gehlfuss, and was directed by Randall Arney, Artistic Director of the Geffen.\n\nTo viewers of the Hallmark Channel, Alicia may be best known for her Christmas films \u2018Christmas at Cartwright\u2019s\u2019 (2014) and \u2018A Very Merry Mix-Up\u2019 (2013), which have become their highest rated of all time.\n\nIn 2013, Alicia appeared opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the independent family dramedy 'Cold Turkey', in a performance which NY Daily News critic David Edelstein hailed as one of the best of 2013, and garnered the headline \u2018See Cold Turkey For Alicia Witt\u2019s Performance\u2019 in the Village Voice. Also released in 2013 was the film 'I Do', which had a nationwide theatrical release after screening at 25 festivals worldwide and winning 10 awards.

That same year she played Detective Nola Falacci opposite Chris Noth on NBC\u2019s 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' for half a season, taking over for Julianne Nicholson while she was on maternity leave.\n\nOther roles include Paramount\u2019s 'Last Holiday' with Queen Latifah and Timothy Hutton, and New Line\u2019s critically acclaimed film \u2018The Upside of Anger\u2019, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, opposite Joan Allen & Kevin Costner. She also starred in Warner Bros\u2019 hit romantic comedy, 'Two Weeks Notice', opposite Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt appeared on-stage in fall 2006 at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre in Terry Johnson\u2019s 'Piano/Forte'.

The film, directed by Rafal Zielinski, depicts a tale of two disturbed young girls whose quest for fun leads them to murder. Witt received the \u201cSpecial Jury Recognition\u201d Award at Sundance and a nomination for an Independent Spirit Award. In 1998, she starred in Columbia Tristar\u2019s hit horror movie, 'Urban Legend.\n\nOn television, Witt starred for four seasons as Cybill Shepherd\u2019s daughter Zoey on the hit CBS sitcom \u2018Cybill\u2019. She also guest starred on the phenomenally successful HBO series, \u2018The Sopranos\u2019, and the Emmy award winning \u2018Ally McBeal\u2019, in which she sang with Randy Newman. Witt combined her acting talents with her skills as a pianist in the romantic comedy, 'Playing Mona Lisa'.\n\nAlicia made her directorial debut with the short film 'Belinda\u2019s Swan Song', which she also wrote. The film premiered at the 2006 Rhode Island International Film Festival and was screened at 9 additional festivals around the world, including the Los Angeles International Short Film Festival.\n\nShe also appeared in 'Mr. Holland\u2019s Opus', opposite Richard Dreyfuss, as clarinet player Gertrude, as well as 'Four Rooms' (Miramax) with Tim Roth, Madonna, and Lili Taylor, and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Allison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Alexandre Rockwell.
