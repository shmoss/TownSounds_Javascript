Their eighth full-length is a collection of ruthlessly melodic and irresistibly compelling progressive folk metal that will immediately resonate with any who have followed the band at any point over the two decades of their storied career. \"Being so close to the album, it's almost impossible for us in the band to have an objective opinion about it, but my impression is that it's a more diverse collection that's also more extreme in some ways. There are more instrumental passages than on 'Valkyrja' (2013), and there are a lot of guitar and bass details,\" states guitarist/vocalist Heri Joensen. \"I really feel we've realized the vision we set out to create all those years ago, and as I listen through the album, I am satisfied with every aspect: the epicness, the intricacy, the melodies and harmonies, and the sheer heaviness of it. I love the whole atmosphere of it.\"\n\nKnown for their prolific nature - dropping their first five full-lengths in the space of just seven years - the six-year gap between Valkyrja and Hel is by far the longest between any two of their records. During that period the band toured hard, taking the album around the world, including a support run with Children Of Bodom in North America and an appearance on the 70,000 Tons Of Metal cruise. However, other factors played into this extended break between releases. \"We approached this one differently because I learned that if I continue doing albums in the way we had up to now, I would die from a heart attack before I'm 50!\" says Joensen. \"That's one of the reasons we changed our method and took such a long time on this one.\" That this tactic - which also includes more songwriting contributions from bassist/vocalist Gunnar Thomsen and guitarist Terji Skiben\u00e6s than on previous releases - has been beneficial is borne out in the finished product, which is perhaps more immersive than those that came before. \"Musically it leans a bit towards our album, 'Ragnarok' (2005),\" states Thomsen. \"It's a bit more epic and also much better worked through than any of our previous albums.\" It also marks the recording debut of drummer Tadeusz Rieckmann, who has manned the drum throne for T\u00fdr's live shows since 2016. \"We had some problems finding the right guy some years back, but Tadeusz is the man for the job,\" says Joensen. \"He's a very technically able drummer, but at the same time, he has a very natural old-school heaviness to his style, and he plays with deep emotion, which is just what we need.\"\n\nConceptually, the album is informed by a combination of mythology, personal experience and observations of current international events, making for a multifaceted experience that can be processed and understood on many levels. Starting not with a specific story to tell but with an atmosphere in mind, Joensen prefers not to disclose too much detail when it comes to lyrics, keen for listeners to have a chance to take what they want from the songs, though he provides a basic description of that which inspired him. \"Hel is the realm of death in Norse mythology, the underworld where those who die a natural death, not in battle, go. A bit confusingly, it is also the name of the goddess who rules over the same realm. She's the daughter of Loki and a terrifying creature to look upon.\" Two of the songs - \"Ragnars Kv\u00e6\u00f5i\" and \"\u00c1lvur Kongur\" - are traditional Faroese ballads and are as such sung in Joensen's native tongue. Followers of T\u00fdr will be aware that they have on numerous occasions strayed from English, which Joensen acknowledges as the \"language of metal\", though this time out it is only the ballads that feature non-English lyrics. \"If I have a good folky melody, I always have the thought that I should write the lyrics in Faroese, but I seldom have the time. The traditional songs come with lyrics, so it's just about picking out the verses I want to use.\" These tracks were in actuality selected even before the release of Valkyrja and have had a long gestation period, Joensen feeling that in adapting them they very much fit with the band's signature sound. \"I am always trying out melodies and chose 'Ragnars Kv\u00e6\u00f0i' first for the fascinating melody in the chorus, and secondly for the storyline. The other ballad I picked first because of the lyrics, which refer to Odin extensively, and secondly for the melody and chorus. I was very satisfied with the harmonies and epic feel of the arrangements I'd come up with, and to tell you the truth, I wish there were more songs of this kind on the album.\"\n\nHel was tracked entirely by Thomsen and Joensen, with sessions split between the latter's studio in S\u00f8ldarfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur, drums lain down at Jacob Hansen's studio in Denmark, Skiben\u00e6s working in his home studio, and some solos and bass details recorded while they were on the road in North America. \"The sessions took us a long time because we did it all on our own. But we gathered a lot of knowhow while doing it, so it will be a good reference for the future,\" states Thomsen. Joensen concurs, adding, \"It was a bit more relaxing than usual, which was good for me. It took some discipline, and creative people are not typically the most disciplined types. I am definitely not, so I guess it could have gone faster with someone else at the whip!\" That the delay in getting the record out means it's emerging in the twentieth year of T\u00fdr's existence is quite poignant. It has definitely not been an easy road to this point, with several members having come and gone, and those that remain having had to endure some very difficult periods, but despite all of it, they have managed to make it through, and achieved a great deal in the process. \"I did dream about becoming an internationally successful professional when I started. It's what I aimed at, but still it's a bit surreal that we've made it this far,\" Joensen admits. \"I didn't in my wildest dreams think I could put survive such misery and abject poverty that this career has lead me through. Still, here I am.\" Thomsen \"could not be prouder\" when he looks back at the string of records they have released, also acknowledging the ups and downs experienced along the way, but making an important point: \"We've done something nobody from where we're from has done before,\" he states plainly. \"But there's a lot more to come!\"\n\nKeep up to date with T\u00ddR at the following locations:\nhttp://www.tyr.fo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tyrband\nhttps://twitter.com/tyrband\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tyr_official\nhttps://www.youtube.com/tyrband\n\n\nBand History:\nProfession of the Christian Faith or Decapitation: This was the choice given by Sigmundur to his Faroese Viking compatriot Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu. And so it was that in 999 A.D., the Christianization of the small \u201cFaeroe Islands\u201d began, casting a veil of oblivion over the ancient Scandinavian gods and only leaving the relics of forgotten heathenry buried deep within the Christian ritual. Or so it was believed...\n\nExactly 999 years later, a small group fondly remembering the archaic gods and rites came together to form the Faroese Viking metal band, T\u00ddR. The one-armed God of War \u2014the bravest of all\u2014 became the eponym of the Nordic quartet. Yet T\u00ddR mastermind Heri Joensen is no war monger in disguise and points out that T\u00ddR (also known as the God of Justice) is also revered for first seeking the avenues of diplomacy\u2014an attribute that does not take away from this god of war\u2019s drive.\n\nA distinctive trademark that sets T\u00ddR apart from most other bands of the Viking metal genre is the authenticity of their music: \u201cTraditional music dating back to the Vikings, that is not preserved anywhere else in the world, not even in Iceland, is passed on in an oral tradition here and it is still alive and well. That is what we build our music on and draw great inspiration from,\u201d explains Joensen.\n\nAlmost every song is based on Faroese or Norwegian lore, and is riveted in the garb of the folk metal genre. Its approach unmistakably creates very true Viking metal.\n\nFollowing the release of a demo, the \u00d3lavur Riddararos single, full-length How Far to Asgard, six years of innumerable gigs, and several domestic television appearances, T\u00ddR\u2019s second full-length Eric the Red became the Islands\u2019 best-selling album, coming to the attention of Napalm Records, the label that finally made the album available worldwide in 2006.\n\nImmediately, the unique approach of T\u00ddR\u00b4s music, melting traditional Nordic songs and dances with Celtic influences, doom, heavy, and progressive metal found fans around the globe. \u201cHail to The Hammer\u201d became the hymn to the new generation of folk, pagan, and Viking metal fans.\n\nIn late 2006, T\u00ddR refined their trademark sound with Ragnarok. Technically brilliant and 100 percent authentic, Ragnarok was nothing less than a masterpiece within the true Viking metal genre. The Faroese band embarked on a European tour with Die Apokalyptischen Reiter and a few months later with AMON AMARTH. Though musically different, T\u00ddR gained legions of new fans, impressed by the four men on stage, who were able to turn every show into a demonstration of musical prowess.\n\nFestival appearances throughout Europe and continued touring followed until T\u00ddR enjoyed their biggest live triumph ever at the very over-crowded Wet Stage in Wacken.\n\nLand was released in 2008 and proved to be yet another milestone in the band\u2019s career. Traditional Faroese lyrics marked tracks such as \u201cG\u00e1tu R\u00edma,\u201d \u201cF\u00edpan Fagra\u201d and \u201cLokka T\u00e1ttur,\u201d and \u201cGandkv\u00e6\u00f0i Tr\u00f3ndar,\u201d which is a poem by J.H.O. Djurhuus about the Faroese chieftain Tr\u00f3ndur, who fought against the dying of the old beliefs and for the independence of the Faeroes. A video clip was produced to the fan favorite \u201cSinklars V\u00edsa.\u201d Land received overwhelming positive feedback and a new audience was able to experience the power of T\u00ddR for the first time.\n\nFollowing the release of Land, T\u00ddR embarked on numerous tours through Europe. One of the highlights was without a doubt the Aaskereia Festival tour with then label-mates Alestorm and Hollenthon. Thanks to their efforts, the band reached many new fans with their memorable concerts. 2008 ended with T\u00ddR being nominated as \u201cBand of the Year\u201d by the Faroese National TV and radio. However, the band had no time to rest on its laurels and embarked on yet another tour through North America in the spring of 2009.\n\nDespite their busy touring schedule, T\u00ddR worked on new songs recorded in early 2009. The band chose to produce the album on native soil. Jacob Hansen mixed the new material with finishing touches provided by the mastering experts at Finnvox. By the Light of the Northern Star met with great feedback from fans and critics alike. The new anthem \u201cHold the Heathen Hammer High\u201c was regarded as the legitimate successor to \u201cHail to the Hammer.\u201d After the release of the album By the Light of the Northern Star, the band played numerous concerts and festivals, as well as taking part in the 70.000 Tons of Metal cruise, while still finding the time to work on new material for their upcoming release.\n\nThe story of King Thrym, who dared steal Thor\u00b4s hammer \"Mjollnir,\" may set the lyrical stage on T\u00ddR's latest album, but it does not prevent them from covering more current topics like in the track \"Shadow of the Swastika.\" The Lay of Thrym follows the path of the band's previous releases by uniting classic heavy metal riffs with impressive drumming, traditional melodies, and powerful choruses. The result is a number of epic anthems, such as \"Take Your T\u00ddRant\" and \"Hall of Freedom,\" both of which will most certainly earn a permanent spot on T\u00ddR's future set lists. Frontman Heri Joensen continues to give T\u00ddR a unique and unmistakable edge with magnificent vocals and superb guitar work. Jacob Hansen was again responsible for recording, mixing, and mastering the album, complementing this fascinating Faeroese sound universe with finishing touches that allow every last detail to shine. The Lay of Thrym is a genuine Viking metal album that will undoubtedly secure T\u00ddR's hold on this genre with its heroic melodies and glorious riffs.\n\nValkyrja, the 7 full-length album from the Faroe Islands natives T\u00ddR, is a concept album with a story line based loosely around an nameless Viking age warrior who leaves his woman and goes off to impress the Valkyrie on the battlefield so that she may bring him to Valhalla, or to F\u00f3lkvangr, the home of Freyja\u2014the goddess associated with love, sexuality, beauty, fertility, gold, sorcery, war, and death. One can say the album is also indirectly about women and how they affect men and what men will do to impress and obtain women. Frontman and founder Heri Joensen goes on to explain; \u201cthe woman that the warrior leaves may represent the earthly women. Freyja, The Lady Of The Slain, may represent the perfection of Women, and the Valkyrie is the link between the two, taking men from earthly to godly women.\u201d\n\nRecorded at Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark with Jacob Hansen who handled production, mixing and mastering, the band began writing guitars and drums for Valkyrja over a year ago with melody lines and arrangements being handled in the studio. \u201cI had the story outline and approximate titles very early in the writing process, but only very late, maybe almost too late, did I write the actual lyrics,\u201d comments Heri Joensen. The band\u2019s drummer, K\u00e1ri Streymoy, parted ways with T\u00ddR after the band completed their US run on Pagan Fest and before they entered the studio so T\u00ddR enlisted George Kollias who stepped in to handle recording duties on Valkyrja. In terms of what the band hopes fans take away from the album, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen states \u201cI hope they will enjoy it and they like the new direction as well as (guitarist) Terji's bigger involvement in writing and George's drumming. We had a more upbeat direction without changing T\u00ddR's style.\u201d\n\nDiscography:\n\u00d3lavur Riddararos (2002)\nHow Far to Asgard (2002)\nEric the Red (2003)\nEric the Red re-released (2006)\nRagnarok (2006)\nLand (2008)\nHow Far to Asgard re-released (2008)\nBy the Light of the Northern Star (2009)\nThe Lay of Thrym (2011)\nValkyrja (2013)\nHel (2019)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Leila Sunier ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8789100.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Folk Jazz, Pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "SoFar San Francisco", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "10 Ave of the Flags, San Rafael, CA 94903", "Artist": "AbbaFab ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8072786.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.533538, 38.002387], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Scotty Pearson, Kayla Kenzior, Anne Davies, Terry Davies, Nick Davies", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Marin Center Showcase Theater", "moreBioInfo": "AbbaFab is the ultimate ABBA concert. 2 hours of unadulterated FUN!!

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "77 Harrison Ave, Campbell, CA 95008", "Artist": "123 Andr\u00e9s ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10235218.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.9425, 37.28829], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Alternative", "Time": "5:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Campbell Library", "moreBioInfo": "123 Andr\u00e9s is the bilingual music duo made up of Christina & Andr\u00e9s.

Pool had carved out a unique place for himself in the bass music community; performing under the moniker of SPL for over 10 years and releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and trap-oriented music on respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Sub Human, Rottunn, and SMOG Recordings. SPL\u2019s music was fully immersed in sound design, a musical landscape comprised of melodic, dark, and refined touches. By the Summer of 2014, Pool came to the realization that he had pushed the SPL project to its sonic boundaries and in order to evolve musically, he would need a new project to explore lighter textures and richer melodies. Rooted in jungle and bass music and built around elements of blippy 8-bit sounds, arpeggios, and lush 80s synths, Champagne Drip launched as a decidedly tropical and uplifting sounding project. Operating at first in anonymity, Champagne Drip made a big splash thru the release of official remixes of Bassnectar (Amorphous Music) and Elliphant (Mad Decent). Shortly thereafter, he released his debut EP \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d on Mad Decent in September of 2014. Over the first year of the project\u2019s history, press outlets were fascinated with the unique sound, but also with uncovering the identity of the secretive producer behind the music. \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d was subsequently remixed by electronic upstarts Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick and released in the Spring of 2015 as \u201cRemix Bikini\u201d. In the Fall of 2015, Champagne Drip released his 2nd EP for Mad Decent, \u201cJourney Into The Champagne Sea\u201d. Whereas his first EP explored more overtly tropical overtones, \u201cJourney\u201d went into deeper and darker musical territory. After spending one full year refining his sound in the studio, he finally revealed himself as the former SPL in 2016; performing across the US at such festivals as Mysteryland, WTFest?, Imagine, Enchanted Forest, and Lights All Night. Building up anticipation for his next original recordings, Champagne Drip released the stand alone single \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d, which was featured on the official Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign fundraising compilation \u201cRave4Bernie\u201d. Official remixes for Grandtheft (Mad Decent), Cardinox (Warner Brothers), and Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE (Mad Decent) followed. Champagne Drip capped off an already busy 2016 with the release of two new EPs; \u201cPoseidon\u201d via Quality Goods Records and \u201cOf Course I Still Love You\u201d via Saturate Records. Official remixes for Zeds Dead & Diplo, UZ, and DAWN all saw early 2017 releases. Champagne Drip is set to have his biggest year yet in 2017, with multiple EPs scheduled for release on Deadbeats Records as well as forthcoming remixes for 12th Planet and Mayhem, which are due for Summer releases. https://twitter.com/champagnedrip https://soundcloud.com/champagnedrip https://www.instagram.com/champagnedrip Bookings: champagnedripbookings@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "308 Main St, Vacaville, CA 95688", "Artist": "Rachel Steele ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8392760.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.989455, 38.356373], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Theatre DeVille", "moreBioInfo": "Rachel Steele, the energetic and \u201csassy\u201d singer/songwriter brings her pristine vocals and her A-game to every performance.

There might be the occasional double-time breaks and the heavy and deep typically viennese feeling.\n\nConsider K&D to roam in their own, unique realm of musical beutekunst that owes and gives a lot to rare funk tunes, electric jazz arrangements, the feeling of deep soul, hiphop, dub, reggae, ambient, fusion, brazil, chansons, dope beats and drum+bass and still a lot more influences that happen to find the interest of the two austrians.\n\nAt a time when hip hopbeats started to emancipate themselves from the rapping and everyone started to pay highest attention to the blooming breakbeat scene in the UK, K&D broke through out of nowhere with one 4-track e.p. (G-stoned) that featured a hypnotic track called High Noon and a cover that showed the dj-duo in true Simon & Garfunkel form, straight out of Richard Avedon anno 1969.\n\nThe impact was massive, especially since the first wave of enthusiasm came from the UK where musical imports from the continent are seldom appreciated. Gilles Peterson played the track at first on his famous now called Worldwide-show.\n\nGathering momentum with support from people like Wall of Sounds Mark Jones and tracks for fellow Austrians Count Basic or strange people like William Orbit, the further story of K&D and Richard's Tosca project is well documented on various compilations and twelve inch releases. They met people like the Ninja tune posse, touched base with the leftfield dance, befriended Munich's Compost crew, remixed artists as diverse as Bomb the bass, Bones thugs & harmony, Alex Reece, United Future Organisation, Rockers Hifi (the K&D version was used in the video of \"Going under\"), Lamb, Roni Size, Depeche Mode and dj-ed in more clubs than you would care to count.\n\nBe it their self-produced tracks or the sound of their remixes, the K&D symptomatic feeling of lush european loungcore-dub pervaded all swift changes of the triphop hype and survived as a highly personal expression that found easy access into the world of drum&bass when the breakbeats became soulful.\n\nTheir regular presence in the club circuit, a characteristic side effect of their consistant travelling as djs, made them well-received guest at the various crossing of an international beat-set that took them from Vienna to London, to the American Westcoast, to Germany and back, with a tightly packed dj-bag full of remixes tracing their steps.\n\nA mix-CD compilation, DJ-kicks, for german label studio K7 marked a relevant change in the overall concept of K&D or rather in the way the audience seemed to take them in. From being well-respected underground heroes they had emerged to be full fledged media-celebrities in the music-press whose mix-CD was so excellently mixed and selected, that many new fans were attracted all over the world.\n\nK&D are maybe something like the continental answer to the british breakbeat or the american illbient scene, but then again their musical imprint is outernational anyway. They could achieve the special abstract global reputation that makes them neighbours to RockersHifi, Fila Brazilia, Howie B., DJ Shadow, the wordsound collective, Coldcut or the Thievery corporation in a virtual neighbourhood of twekwando-ing beatmeisters.\n\nBut, with a number of prolific dj-dates of K&D all around the world and the production and releases of Tosca and Peace Orchestra as well as numerous remixes, it seems unavoidable that there will be a lot of talk about Peter Kruder & Richard Dorfmeister.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "30 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Dirtybeats ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8199801.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.889735, 37.335686], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Bass Music, Drumandbass, Trap, Bass House, Dubstep", "Time": "4:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Elev8 Night club", "moreBioInfo": "San Jose, Ca based producer & Dj ( DirtyBeats ) is a veteran in the Bay area and the dubstep scene, with a cyberpunk style of hard hitting synths and massive bass.\n\nBelow is DirtyBeats EPK all hotlinks on the images are active.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01S911YqOmIRWhiTzRWUmtnS1VsT2k2UVdRNTVDa1FyU1Fv", "otherInfo": "After taking a quite long hiatus, Surface Lights is proud to be back with another huge show in the heart of downtown San Jose.

Driven and inspired by the thriving music scene of his hometown which includes such greats as Professor Longhair, Doctor John and The Meters, Moore\u2019s name is now mentioned amongst these Big Easy mainstays.\n\nIn the early \u201890s, Moore helped found the New Orleans-based essential funk band Galactic. Their first album, 1996\u2019s widely acclaimed Coolin\u2019 Off, led to an intense tour schedule of nearly 200 gigs a year for the next ten years. Building on their fan base by adding an esteemed list of all-star collaborations to the six albums that followed, Galactic continues to amass a worldwide audience via recording and touring globally.\n\nMoore launched his solo career in 1998 aided by eight-string guitar virtuoso Charlie Hunter and saxophonist Skerik (Les Claypool, John Scofield, Roger Waters). The group recorded All Kooked Out! featuring a handful of local New Orleans musicians as well.\n\nIn the midst of these recording sessions yet another concept was taking shape. Outtakes turned into the first Garage a Trois release, Mysteryfunk (1999). In 2000 the trio, led by Moore behind the drum kit, was joined by percussionist Mike Dillon (Les Claypool, Ani DiFranco) and has since released three more albums \u2013 Emphasizer in 2003, Outre Mer in 2005 and Power Patriot in 2009.\n\nMoore extended his solo discography with the release of Flyin\u2019 the Koop (Verve/Blue Thumb) in 2001, and III (Telarc) in 2006. Following the latter Modern Drummer called Moore\u2019s trademark sound \u201cinfectious, jazz-meets-Bonham, nouveau second-line.\u201d Recorded at the legendary Preservation Hall in New Orleans, III featured organist Robert Walter (Greyboy Allstars, The Head Hunters) and guitarist Will Bernard (T.J. Kirk, Doctor Lonnie Smith) as the Stanton Moore Trio, with special guests Skerik and trombonist Mark Mullins (Galactic, Bonerama, Harry Connick, Jr., Better Than Ezra).\n\nIn 2008, Moore looked to continue his scaled back session crew with Walter and Bernard to record Emphasis! (on parenthesis). Says Moore, \u201cWhen it came time to do another record, I had already known for a while that I wanted to build on the momentum of this band \u2013 three musicians who were becoming a unit unto themselves \u2013 and I wanted to get a little more adventurous with the music itself.\u201d\n\nIn April 2010, Moore releases Groove Alchemy. The 12-track set is the culmination of Moore\u2019s multimedia project that also includes an instructional book and DVD of the same name. All three facets of the project are designed to explore the roots of funk drumming by examining the work of pioneers like Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Zigaboo Modeliste \u2013 each of whom made their mark at different times throughout the 1960s as the engines driving James Brown\u2019s and the Meters\u2019 legendary rhythm sections \u2013 and in turn tracing their influences back to the rhythms coming out of New Orleans in the earlier part of the 20th century. Recorded at Levon Helm\u2019s studio in Woodstock, NY, this project is the follow up to the widely acclaimed Take it to the Street DVD and book that focused specifically on New Orleans drumming styles.\n\nShowing his outstanding versatility, Moore has appeared on Heavy Metal Grammy nominees Corrosion of Conformity\u2019s In the Arms of God, Irma Thomas\u2019 After the Rain (winning a grammy in the process), Robert Walter\u2019s Super Heavy Organ, Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) and Boots Riley\u2019s (the Coup) Street Sweeper Social Club, Will BernarDiane Birch\u2019s Bible Belt, Alec Ounsworth\u2019s (Clap Your Hands Say Yeah) Mo Beauty. He continues to play dates globally with an ever-evolving cast of musicians including John Scofield; Karl Denson; George Porter, Jr., and Leo Nocentelli (of the Meters); Charlie Hunter; Warren Haynes; John Medeski and Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin and Wood); Donald Harrison Jr.; Dr. Lonnie Smith, Dr. John, Tab Benoit, Robert Walter; the New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to name a few.\n\nWith a bachelor\u2019s degree in music and business from Loyola University, Moore stays involved in education by constantly giving clinics and teaching master classes and private lessons all over the world. He has been a contributing writer for Drum!, Modern Drummer, and DownBeat magazines here he was featured on the covers of more than six drum publications. In 2005, he launched a signature line of cymbals with Bosphorus Cymbals and a signature drumstick with the Vic Firth stick company. In 2009, Moore developed his own drum company to introduce his signature titanium snare drum that he designed in conjunction with Ronn Dunnett.\n\nDeeply affected by Katrina and its aftermath, New Orleans\u2019 native son was quick to lend a hand by spearheaded the Tipitina\u2019s Music Workshop, free Sunday seminars that cater to children and a rotating cast of well-known professionals to promote the preservation of New Orleans music. He also set up the Staletta Fund, a scholarship started by he and his wife Aletta to help cover costs for aspiring students to attend jazz camps, auditions and further their education.\n\nMoore stays active as a spokesperson for the Gulf Restoration Network and is a regular proponent of and player with the Voice of the Wetlands All-Stars. Additionally he serves on the board of directors for the Roots of Music, a free music education and academic mentoring program founded by Derrick Tabb, drummer for Rebirth Brass Band and recent nominee for CNN\u2019s Heroes awards.\n\nGalactic\u2019s next record Ya-ka-may was released February 2010, and Moore steps into the role of producer on Anders Osborne\u2019s next record due out in April.", "otherInfo": "General Admission.

Later, collaborating with Prince as a songwriter and Co-Producer on his projects. Now the lead guitarist and Musical Director of The Purple Ones, Seacer is determined to continue the musical legacy of his late friend and former band mate. He says one of the biggest keys to the authenticity is the \u2018controlled chaos\u201d that existed in Prince\u2019s world that allowed for extreme creativity, \u201cWith Prince,\u201d Levi says, \u201cyou tried everything.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Fang guitarist Tom Flynn and bass player Brian Beattie, his former bandmate from the bands \"Tapeworm\" and \"Safety Patrol\", put out \"Yukon Fang\" as a duo and thus Fang was born. The original version of Fang toured the country once, only to break up shortly thereafter with Beattie moving on to Texas where he later formed the band Glass Eye. In the early fall of 1981 Flynn began playing with drummer Chris Ritter. They soon added bass player Chris Wilson and began playing shows in the SF Bay area as a three piece, with Flynn on vocals.While this was happening, Sam McBride, the band's soon-to-be vocalist, was singing with future Fang drummer Greg Langston in the band \"Shut up\". In early 1982 Ritter was replaced with drummer Joel Fox, and at Fox's audition he brought along his friend McBride, who volunteered to be the band's singer. The lineup thus solidified as McBride (vocals), Chris Wilson (bass), Tom Flynn (guitar), and Joel Fox (drums). Together they contributed the song \"Fun with Acid\" on the Not so Quiet on the Western Front compilation LP. Shortly thereafter, guitarist Tom Flynn created \"Boner Records\" and released their debut LP and EP Landshark and Where the Wild Things Are. Tim Stiletto drummed on the latter. These two releases are now considered classic East Bay punk.\n\nIn January 1986, the \"Spun Helga\" LP was recorded in West Germany with McBride singing vocals, and two Germans named Joe (Guitar) and Ollie (Drums) playing instruments. We Bite Records in Germany released the LP, but in the U.S. it was handled by National Trust Records. Fang next released was 1987's \"A Mi Ga Sfafas?\" (The title literally means \"Give Me Head?\"). The lineup during this era was McBride, Bill Collins (guitar), Joe Miller (bass), and Steve Chinn (drums). Drummer Mike Branum replaced Chinn and Fang recorded the album \"Pissed-Off Buddah\", which remained unreleased until 2008, when it was released with Fang's other albums \"Spun Helga\" and \"A Mi Ga Sfafas?\"\n\nAfter a long break, Fang regrouped in 1996 and put out the \"Electric Chair\" single on Man's Ruin Records. The lineup at this time included Sam McBride (vocals), Greg Langston (Drums), Bill Burnett (Guitar) and Josh Levine (Bass). This incarnation of the Band recorded the \"American Nightmare\" LP on Wingnut Records.\n\nIn 1989, Boner Records released Fang's first compilation album, Landshark/Where the Wild Thing Are. The album included Fang's debut album and debut EP.\n\nIn 1999, Jim Martin (from Faith No More) joined on guitar, and recorded four songs for the Hello Records CD Fish and Vegetables, which was released as a split LP by fellow punk rock groups Dr. Know, and Hellions In May 2000, Sammytown and Jim Martin, along with Casey Orr (Gwar, Rigor Mortis) on bass, and Dallas drummer Clint Phillips did two shows in Texas. One at Trees in Dallas, and a sold out show at Emo's in Austin.\n\nBy 2001, the band was composed of Sammytown, Brian Schopflin (bass), Jonny Manak (guitar), Alby Wasted (guitar),and Ike Eichensehr (drums). Sammytown, Brian, Jonny, Alby and Ike also started The Resistoleros, a Oakland-based rock 'n' roll band. Steel Cage Records released the Resistoleros CD Rock 'N Roll Napalm in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, the Live Cheap\" CD' came out on Malt Soda Recordings featuring Sammytown (vocals), Brian Schopflin (bass), Ike Eichensehr (drums), Alby Wasted (guitar) and Jimmy Crucifix (guitarist for 1980s hardcore band Crucifix and hard rock band Proudflesh) also on guitar. This is the only Fang recording with two guitarists.\n\nIn 2004, the band toured the United States.

There, Schneider began to develop her personal way of writing for what would become her 18-member collective, made up of many of the finest musicians in jazz today, tailoring her compositions to distinctly highlight the uniquely creative voices of the group. The Maria Schneider Orchestra has performed at festivals and concert halls worldwide. She herself has received numerous commissions and guest-conducting invites, working with over 90 groups in over 30 countries.\n\nSchneider\u2019s music blurs the lines between genres, making her long list of commissioners quite varied, stretching from Jazz at Lincoln Center, to The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, to collaborating with David Bowie. She is among a small few to have received GRAMMYS in multiple genres, have received the award in both jazz and classical categories, as well as for her work with David Bowie.\n\nSchneider and her orchestra have a distinguished recording career with twelve GRAMMY nominations and five GRAMMY awards. Unique funding of projects has become a hallmark for Schneider through the trend-setting company, ArtistShare. Her album, Concert in the Garden (2004) became historic as the first recording to win a GRAMMY with Internet-only sales, even more significantly, it blazed the \"crowd-funding\" trail as ArtistShare\u2019s first release. She\u2019s been awarded many honors by the Jazz Journalists Association and DOWNBEAT and JAZZTIMES Critics and Readers Polls. In 2012, her alma mater, the University of Minnesota, presented Schneider with an honorary doctorate. ASCAP awarded her their esteemed Concert Music Award in 2014. And in 2019, the National Endowment for the Arts bestowed on Schneider the nation's highest honor in jazz, naming her an NEA Jazz Master.\n\nSchneider has become a strong voice for music advocacy and in 2014, testified before the US Congressional Subcommittee on Intellectual Property about digital rights. She has also appeared in CNN, participated in round-tables for the United States Copyright Office, and has been quoted in numerous publications for her views on Spotify, Pandora, YouTube, Google, digital rights, and music piracy.\n\nA collaboration with her orchestra and David Bowie resulted in his single called, \"Sue (Or In A Season of Crime),\u201d and brought Schneider a 2016 GRAMMY (Best Arrangement, Instruments and Vocals).

Pool had carved out a unique place for himself in the bass music community; performing under the moniker of SPL for over 10 years and releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and trap-oriented music on respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Sub Human, Rottunn, and SMOG Recordings. SPL\u2019s music was fully immersed in sound design, a musical landscape comprised of melodic, dark, and refined touches. By the Summer of 2014, Pool came to the realization that he had pushed the SPL project to its sonic boundaries and in order to evolve musically, he would need a new project to explore lighter textures and richer melodies. Rooted in jungle and bass music and built around elements of blippy 8-bit sounds, arpeggios, and lush 80s synths, Champagne Drip launched as a decidedly tropical and uplifting sounding project. Operating at first in anonymity, Champagne Drip made a big splash thru the release of official remixes of Bassnectar (Amorphous Music) and Elliphant (Mad Decent). Shortly thereafter, he released his debut EP \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d on Mad Decent in September of 2014. Over the first year of the project\u2019s history, press outlets were fascinated with the unique sound, but also with uncovering the identity of the secretive producer behind the music. \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d was subsequently remixed by electronic upstarts Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick and released in the Spring of 2015 as \u201cRemix Bikini\u201d. In the Fall of 2015, Champagne Drip released his 2nd EP for Mad Decent, \u201cJourney Into The Champagne Sea\u201d. Whereas his first EP explored more overtly tropical overtones, \u201cJourney\u201d went into deeper and darker musical territory. After spending one full year refining his sound in the studio, he finally revealed himself as the former SPL in 2016; performing across the US at such festivals as Mysteryland, WTFest?, Imagine, Enchanted Forest, and Lights All Night. Building up anticipation for his next original recordings, Champagne Drip released the stand alone single \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d, which was featured on the official Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign fundraising compilation \u201cRave4Bernie\u201d. Official remixes for Grandtheft (Mad Decent), Cardinox (Warner Brothers), and Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE (Mad Decent) followed. Champagne Drip capped off an already busy 2016 with the release of two new EPs; \u201cPoseidon\u201d via Quality Goods Records and \u201cOf Course I Still Love You\u201d via Saturate Records. Official remixes for Zeds Dead & Diplo, UZ, and DAWN all saw early 2017 releases. Champagne Drip is set to have his biggest year yet in 2017, with multiple EPs scheduled for release on Deadbeats Records as well as forthcoming remixes for 12th Planet and Mayhem, which are due for Summer releases. https://twitter.com/champagnedrip https://soundcloud.com/champagnedrip https://www.instagram.com/champagnedrip Bookings: champagnedripbookings@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Teddy Abrams ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6264505.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419994, 37.777441], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Davies Symphony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Teddy Abrams is an American conductor, composer, pianist, and clarinetist.", "otherInfo": "This week, the San Francisco Symphony brings together two composers\u2014one past and one present\u2014for an inspired pairing of audience favorites.

Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is bringing our unique blues and original Americana music back to The Back Room.

Among its many awesomely quirky attractions (beyond dope AF lobster rolls, of course), the mini-metropolis boasts the International Cryptozoology Museum and even served as the site of the nation\u2019s first chewing gum factory. Suffice it to say, the town possesses all kinds of character and charm. It also makes perfect sense as HQ for Weakened Friends. Three alternative rock wiseasses and snack food connoisseurs, the trio\u2014Sonia Sturino [vocals, guitar], Annie Hoffman [bass], and Cam Jones [drums]\u2014first congregated in their adopted hometown during 2014. Sonia had recently relocated from Toronto and holed up in a house with Cam and a bunch of other dudes before witnessing Annie play live and asking her to join the band. As they released two independent EPs, Gloomy Tunes and Crushed, they stirred up a palpable buzz (between consuming sour spaghetti and causing trouble). Gigs followed with everyone from CHVRCHES and Silversun Pickups to Beach Slang and Juliana Hatfield as they made their 2017 debut at SXSW and earned praise from Vanyaland, CBS, If It\u2019s Too Loud, and many more. A wiry, whimsical, and wild fusion of disarmingly pop hooks and fuzzed-out riffery that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the Reality Bites soundtrack or in a modern Brooklyn bar fueled this quiet rise. \u201cIf something is ear catching and interesting, I\u2019m drawn to it,\u201d says Sturino. \u201cI love pop hooks, but I have this truly weird and shaky voice. I started to embrace that, and I think people connect to the sound.\u201d For the uninitiated, they\u2019ll definitely connect to the group\u2019s 2017 single \u201cHate Mail\u201d featuring J Mascis. On the track, a buzz of feedback slips into melodic guitar and an unshakable rhythm as the frontwoman captivates with the confessionally catchy refrain, \u201cI hate everything you\u2019re saying, get away from me. I hate everything we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a waste of me.\u201d It\u2019s the perfect backdrop for an epic Mascis cameo. \u201cIt\u2019s about when I was miserable in this other band,\u201d recalls Sturino. \u201cThis is the most important thing to me. I don\u2019t live comfortably. I don\u2019t have a lot of money. I don\u2019t have a lot of free time, because I\u2019m putting all of my effort, passion, and self into music. So, it has to be the right situation. At the time, I just wasn\u2019t working with the right team. The song is about those corrosive relationships with emotionally abusive assholes. J is a guitar god for indie rock. He\u2019s an obvious inspiration, and he killed it.\u201d \u201cHate Mail\u201d hints at a lot more to come from Weakened Friends. For Sturino, the band brings everything full circle. In tow with her best friend Cam and wife Annie, she encodes a powerful message in the lyrics. \u201cA lot of times, you hear expressions like, \u2018Find your happy\u2019,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI think you should find yourself. Our music is about self-awareness and finding that. Sometimes, you\u2019re having a shitty day. It can be hard, and that\u2019s beautiful in its own way. In the North American mentality, if you\u2019re depressed or sad, you have to just get rid of it. This is less about getting rid of that feeling and finding those things causing the feeling and dealing with them. It\u2019s self-awareness, believing in yourself, finding yourself, and defining how you feel. That\u2019s what this band is to me.\u201d We're three tall young adults making some songs and eating some snacks.

Driven and inspired by the thriving music scene of his hometown which includes such greats as Professor Longhair, Doctor John and The Meters, Moore\u2019s name is now mentioned amongst these Big Easy mainstays.\n\nIn the early \u201890s, Moore helped found the New Orleans-based essential funk band Galactic. Their first album, 1996\u2019s widely acclaimed Coolin\u2019 Off, led to an intense tour schedule of nearly 200 gigs a year for the next ten years. Building on their fan base by adding an esteemed list of all-star collaborations to the six albums that followed, Galactic continues to amass a worldwide audience via recording and touring globally.\n\nMoore launched his solo career in 1998 aided by eight-string guitar virtuoso Charlie Hunter and saxophonist Skerik (Les Claypool, John Scofield, Roger Waters). The group recorded All Kooked Out! featuring a handful of local New Orleans musicians as well.\n\nIn the midst of these recording sessions yet another concept was taking shape. Outtakes turned into the first Garage a Trois release, Mysteryfunk (1999). In 2000 the trio, led by Moore behind the drum kit, was joined by percussionist Mike Dillon (Les Claypool, Ani DiFranco) and has since released three more albums \u2013 Emphasizer in 2003, Outre Mer in 2005 and Power Patriot in 2009.\n\nMoore extended his solo discography with the release of Flyin\u2019 the Koop (Verve/Blue Thumb) in 2001, and III (Telarc) in 2006. Following the latter Modern Drummer called Moore\u2019s trademark sound \u201cinfectious, jazz-meets-Bonham, nouveau second-line.\u201d Recorded at the legendary Preservation Hall in New Orleans, III featured organist Robert Walter (Greyboy Allstars, The Head Hunters) and guitarist Will Bernard (T.J. Kirk, Doctor Lonnie Smith) as the Stanton Moore Trio, with special guests Skerik and trombonist Mark Mullins (Galactic, Bonerama, Harry Connick, Jr., Better Than Ezra).\n\nIn 2008, Moore looked to continue his scaled back session crew with Walter and Bernard to record Emphasis! (on parenthesis). Says Moore, \u201cWhen it came time to do another record, I had already known for a while that I wanted to build on the momentum of this band \u2013 three musicians who were becoming a unit unto themselves \u2013 and I wanted to get a little more adventurous with the music itself.\u201d\n\nIn April 2010, Moore releases Groove Alchemy. The 12-track set is the culmination of Moore\u2019s multimedia project that also includes an instructional book and DVD of the same name. All three facets of the project are designed to explore the roots of funk drumming by examining the work of pioneers like Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Zigaboo Modeliste \u2013 each of whom made their mark at different times throughout the 1960s as the engines driving James Brown\u2019s and the Meters\u2019 legendary rhythm sections \u2013 and in turn tracing their influences back to the rhythms coming out of New Orleans in the earlier part of the 20th century. Recorded at Levon Helm\u2019s studio in Woodstock, NY, this project is the follow up to the widely acclaimed Take it to the Street DVD and book that focused specifically on New Orleans drumming styles.\n\nShowing his outstanding versatility, Moore has appeared on Heavy Metal Grammy nominees Corrosion of Conformity\u2019s In the Arms of God, Irma Thomas\u2019 After the Rain (winning a grammy in the process), Robert Walter\u2019s Super Heavy Organ, Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) and Boots Riley\u2019s (the Coup) Street Sweeper Social Club, Will BernarDiane Birch\u2019s Bible Belt, Alec Ounsworth\u2019s (Clap Your Hands Say Yeah) Mo Beauty. He continues to play dates globally with an ever-evolving cast of musicians including John Scofield; Karl Denson; George Porter, Jr., and Leo Nocentelli (of the Meters); Charlie Hunter; Warren Haynes; John Medeski and Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin and Wood); Donald Harrison Jr.; Dr. Lonnie Smith, Dr. John, Tab Benoit, Robert Walter; the New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to name a few.\n\nWith a bachelor\u2019s degree in music and business from Loyola University, Moore stays involved in education by constantly giving clinics and teaching master classes and private lessons all over the world. He has been a contributing writer for Drum!, Modern Drummer, and DownBeat magazines here he was featured on the covers of more than six drum publications. In 2005, he launched a signature line of cymbals with Bosphorus Cymbals and a signature drumstick with the Vic Firth stick company. In 2009, Moore developed his own drum company to introduce his signature titanium snare drum that he designed in conjunction with Ronn Dunnett.\n\nDeeply affected by Katrina and its aftermath, New Orleans\u2019 native son was quick to lend a hand by spearheaded the Tipitina\u2019s Music Workshop, free Sunday seminars that cater to children and a rotating cast of well-known professionals to promote the preservation of New Orleans music.

Cuchulain is rapidly developing a cross-country following, with experiences living and performing in places as disparate as Washington, DC, and San Francisco, California.

He constructs a unique world, defines it, and then burns it to the ground. Truly unique and absolutely brilliant.\u201d \u2013All Music Guide\n\nIt\u2019s the ease with which he delivers conversational lyrics and honeyed melodies, a natural magic that is the soul of Tom Freund\u2019s music. Though he\u2019s widely-traveled in a variety of genres\u2013 from hearftelt folk to buoyant pop to boho jazz to straightforward rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and beyond \u2013Freund is, simply put, a singer-songwriter with a defined and captivating presence.\n\n\u201cFreund clearly delights in enigma. His vocals could go from laconic to impassioned without such obvious trickery as cranking up the volume. His lyrics are full of curveballs.\u201d \u2013Washington Post\n\nFreund\u2019s latest disc \u201cTwo Moons\u201d on Surf Road Records draws roots sources for an urbane Americana sound, melding nostalgia with a raw and sharp-eyed views of life today. \u201cIf Two Moons, with its underlying message of hope in this messy world of ours, serves as an inspiring, encouraging soundtrack for listeners, then I can say to myself, \u2018ok, you\u2019re doing something right for the people out there\u201d, Freund says. He delivers this CD\u2019s main message in the standout track \u201cLemme Be Who I Wanna Be,\u201d in which he declares: \u201cI\u2019m basically hooked on this life/it\u2019s got a lot of problems/but it treats me real right/and you don\u2019t have to agree with me/but let me fly my freak flag.\u201d This oddly upbeat anthem of personal empowerment so impressed Canadian rock star Serena Ryder that she asked to sing on it. The opening track \u201cAngel Eyes,\u201d featuring vocals by Ben Harper, serves as Freund\u2019s take on Randy Newman\u2019s \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d motif, expresses his appreciation to his Southern California friends for always having his back. Notes of nostalgia play into Tom\u2019s self-declared favorite track \u201cMind of Your Own\u201d which delves into a deeply personal memory of the New York native\u2019s childhood home.\n\n\u201cIf you want to hear what California feels like, Tom Freund\u2019s new album is a good place to start\u2026\u201d \u2013 Acoustic Guitar\n\nFreund spent the mid-\u201990s touring with the indie rock cult faves THE SILOS and has been releasing solo albums since 1998. Tom has alternated between recording and touring behind his own discs, playing upright bass, electric bass guitar, and mandolin with the likes of British pub-rock great Graham Parker (who hailed Freund as one of the best singer-songwriters operating today), pop star Mandy Moore, groove-soul sensation Brett Dennen, Rock \u2018n Roll Hall of Famer Jackson Browne, and three-time Grammy winner Ben Harper. \u201cWhat really brought me to wanting to work with Tom in the studio is his songs,\u201d Harper concludes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to even go any further than that. As far as I\u2019m concerned, who wouldn\u2019t wanna work with him in the studio? Because the songs are there.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery year the mounting landfill of new releases that threatens to bury the working music journalists yields a few unexpected gems, and Tom Freund is one of them.\u201d\n\u2013New York Times\n\nMore recently, you can spot Freund playing with Parker in the Judd Apatow film, \u201cThis Is 40\u201d and featured on the hit TV shows \u201cParenthood\u201d, \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d and the recently premiered Pamela Adlon show \u201cBetter Things\u201d. He continues to tour North America, Europe and Japan playing with his band or doing solo shows.\n\n\u201cCalifornia-based troubadour Tom Freund sings of skate-boarding kids, impending doom and Happy Days lunch boxes on his new album, Two Moons.\u201d \u2014NPR WEEKEND EDITION http://bit.ly/1N1vuBI", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "427 Mendocino Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95401", "Artist": "Matt Jaffe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8945081.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.715214, 38.441851], "Date": "Sun Apr 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-19", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Rock", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Lost Church Santa Rosa", "moreBioInfo": "Matt Jaffe is a 24 year old rock & roll singer/songwriter from San Francisco.

Jesse's reputation has been steadily building over the past half-decade. His versatile singjay style recalls some of the giants of reggae history, but Jesse\u2019s diverse musical taste and restless artistic spirit have set him on a unique path that is helping propel the genre into new territory. Focusing on what has worked in recent years in the reggae scene \u2013 from the heavy touring, DIY-aesthetics of the U.S. reggae movement to the Sound System and bass culture influences of the U.K. scene \u2013 he\u2019s ready to apply all his experiences along the way to his own journey. Jesse Royal\u2019s time is now.\n\nJesse\u2019s official debut album, Lily Of Da Valley, drops October 6, 2017, in partnership with the New York-based tastemaker label Easy Star Records. Written largely in conjunction with producer and mastermind Llamar \u201cRiff Raff\u201d Brown, who has contributed to a number of Grammy-winning and Grammy-nominated projects, the album represents where Jamaican music is right now, a seamless blending of classic roots with contemporary production and superb musicianship. New songs like \u201c400 Years,\u201d \u201cGeneration,\u201d \u201cLife\u2019s Sweet,\u201d and \u201cAlways Be Around,\u201d will become staples of Jesse\u2019s catalog, which includes earlier megahits like \u201cModern Day Judas\u201d and \u201cFinally.\u201d These two gems have garnered a combined 10 million listens on streaming services worldwide so far and are included on the album along with the new songs.\n\nWith Easy Star, he joins an international family of bands that includes The Skints, Rebelution, The Black Seeds, The Green, Gentleman\u2019s Dub Club, Easy Star All-Stars, The Expanders, John Brown\u2019s Body, and other artists that are evolving reggae from New York to London to New Zealand to Hawaii and beyond. The rest of the team Jesse has assembled puts him in good company: he is managed by Lukes Morgan, of the Grammy-award winning reggae family Morgan Heritage, who in the past year helped break Raging Fyah on the scene en route to a Grammy nomination themselves. Cristy Barber, a trailblazer in reggae music who has helped the careers of Damian \u201cJr. Gong\u201d Marley, Stephen Marley, Beenie Man, Buju Banton, SOJA and many others, is overseeing the marketing campaign. And his team in Jamaica includes his longtime friend Kareem \u201cRemus\u201d Burrell, the son of Fatis Burrell, of Xterminator, one of the most important producers/labels of the dancehall era, and an early mentor of Jesse\u2019s.\n\nIn the lead up to Jesse\u2019s first full length release, he has already been covered by major media outlets such as Vogue and Vice. He has worked closely with the Major Lazer team, releasing a popular mixtape with Walshy Fire, which resulted in his song \u201cIf I Give You My Love\u201d being featured on their cartoon TV series via FXX Network. He has made music with Bad Brains and performed alongside the pioneering punk/reggae band at the Afropunk Festival. He has already toured extensively in the US, UK, and Europe, playing major festivals like Cali Roots, Boomtown Fair, Reggae On The River, and Rototom Sunsplash. He obviously thrives on the unconventional approach, while still keeping grounded in the history of reggae. That\u2019s why he often bristles at being grouped into a movement being called \u201cReggae Revival\u201d \u2013 because to Jesse, he is not reviving the past; he is firmly rooted in the here and now, with an eye on the future.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Joyce Manor ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8780604.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Mon Apr 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-20", "Genre": "Punk, Alternative, Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "Booking - merrick@groundcontroltouring.com\n----\nJoyce Manor\u2019s new album \u2018Million Dollars To Kill Me\u2019, is out September 21 via Epitaph Records.

The Toronto-based multidisciplinary artist's music traces a circuitous evolution. It encompasses unconventional, challenging sound work as prominently as her vocally-driven explorations of American pop mores (often on the same album). Since 2007, Remy has toured several times in Europe, Eastern Canada and the United States. She accompanies her hugely distinctive voice with innovative set-ups, including combinations of reel-to-reel players, tape decks, and samplers, as well as occasionally singing with a full band. Remy has released a clutch of original records on labels as diverse as Siltbreeze, Kraak, FatCat and her own Calico Corp. imprint. While her early Siltbreeze-released works, \u2018Introducing\u2026\u2019 and \u2018Go Grey\u2019, explore the limits of 4-track fidelity, they also bear hallmarks of a budding melodic ear, and vocal cadences clearly born of constant exposure to oldies radio. Given this, it\u2019s little surprise that subsequent U.S. Girls records, \u2018U.S. Girls on Kraak\u2019 and \u2018Gem\u2019 (both co-produced with Remy\u2019s partner, Slim Twig), are works of unabashed pop art. The two albums brought Remy\u2019s voice further into focus, while evincing a playful disregard for genre in splicing together styles as disparate as R n\u2019 B, glam rock, and sound collage. Perhaps what\u2019s most striking about the cumulative power of these records, when taken in combination with her concurrent collage and film work, is Remy\u2019s consistent vision. Her exploration of feminist themes relating to abuse and gender inequality become more clearly defined, even as her sound appears to evolve toward a mainstream, pop idiom. Her narrative use of an \u2018everywoman\u2019 perspective in her lyrics forms something of a feminine counterpoint to Bruce Springsteen\u2019s work. Through this prism, Remy\u2019s project gains resonance as a form of social commentary; music with something truly at stake.

His performances were a raw expression of his spirituality at that time and were supported by musicians who played a foundation of roots reggae augmented by the energy of a rock trio. Fans latched on quickly for a variety of reasons, but in August of 2005, just months after the release of Live at Stubbs, Matisyahu found himself on stage at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival with the de facto leader of improvisational rock-n-roll; Phish\u2019s front man Trey Anastasio.\n\n\u201cKing without a Crown\u201d climbed the charts and Matisyahu\u2019s follow up record Youth was nominated for a Grammy, but the blessings and curses of mainstream success each took root. While Matisyahu\u2019s bands have always been comprised of serious multidimensional players who have artfully molded the foundations of roots reggae into many genres, that early; if only a brief display of complete surrender to the music, seemed in some way to take a back seat. Through his lyrics however, Matisyahu developed a more personal, artistic, and sophisticated way to express the yearning for deep spiritual meaning, and as his own beliefs opened up to find more variety and depth, the desire for his performances to match the unpredictable flow of life developed as well.\n\nNow, more than a decade later, Matisyahu has formed a band that truly gives itself over to the music on par with his lyrical desire to connect to something beyond the self.
