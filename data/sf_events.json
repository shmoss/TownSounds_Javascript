This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint. She continues to tour and record as well as remaining a strong presence in her community, working with local youth as a vocal coach and mentor. She encourages them to follow their dreams to sing freely and wholeheartedly. -Written by Elle K. Productions 9x award-winning R&B/Soul music artist.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

He's a fine player with an attractive sound (influenced a bit by Grover Washington, Jr.) who often caresses melodies, putting a lot of emotion into his solos. Because he does not improvise much (sticking mostly to predictable melody statements), his music largely falls outside of jazz. However, because he is listed at the top of \"contemporary jazz\" charts and is identified with jazz in the minds of the mass public, he is classified as jazz.\n\nKenny Gorelick started playing professionally with Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra in 1976. He recorded with Cold, Bold & Together (a Seattle-based funk group) and freelanced locally. After graduating from the University of Washington, Kenny G worked with Jeff Lorber Fusion, making two albums with the group. Soon he was signed to Arista, recording his debut as a leader in 1982. His fourth album, Duotones (which included the very popular \"Songbird\"), made him into a star. Soon he was in demand for guest appearances on recordings of such famous singers as Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, and Natalie Cole. Kenny G's own records have sold remarkably well, particularly Breathless, which has easily topped eight million copies in the U.S.; his total album sales top 30 million copies. The holiday album Miracles, released in 1994, and 1996's Moment continued the momentum of his massive commercial success. He also recorded his own version of the Celine Dion/Titanic smash \"My Heart Will Go On\" in 1998, but the following year he released Classics in the Key of G, a collection of jazz standards like \"'Round Midnight\" and \"Body and Soul,\" possibly to reclaim some jazz credibility.\n\nFaith: A Holiday Album was released that same year, followed by a limited-edition re-release of the 1997 Greatest Hits disc. In 2002 Kenny G dipped into tropical territory with Paradise, which featured guest appearances by Brian McKnight and Chant\u00e9 Moore. This was followed by a music video collection, another holiday album, entitled Wishes, and, in 2003, a second greatest-hits collection, Ultimate Kenny G. Perhaps in a bid to shake up his discography a bit, in 2004 Kenny G released At Last...The Duets Album, which featured \"duets\" with LeAnn Rimes and Chaka Khan. Two years later, smooth jazz's king of the soprano sax returned to a purely instrumental approach on the brassy, big-band-inspired albums Holiday Collection and I'm in the Mood for Love; 2006 was also the year the artist was dubbed the best golfer in music by Golf Digest, beating out Vince Gill for the number one spot. In 2008, Kenny G released the Latin-inspired Rhythm and Romance. The sax player next drifted toward R&B for 2010's Heart and Soul, which featured guest vocals from Robin Thicke and Babyface. A collection with Rahul Sharma called Namaste followed in 2012, and in 2015 Kenny G released a tribute to bossa nova titled Brazilian Nights, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. In 2017, G kept up his active concert schedule, even pairing with fellow smooth jazz legend George Benson for the limited engagement Breezin' & Breathless Tour.", "otherInfo": "Food and Full Bar Available for PurchaseJAZZ SUPERSTAR KENNY G RETURNS FOR A YEAR-END HOLIDAY RESIDENCY.Kenny will be here for multiple shows over five nights leading up to the New Years Eve celebration performance.Sit down to dinner and wine in an intimate, up close and personal evening with one of the most iconic and best-selling instrumental musicians of all time, Kenny G.With Sold Out shows across the globe, Kenny is ending 2019s year long run of international performances in the picturesque backdrop of the Napa Valley.

As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland. He began playing in a variety of Bay Area blues and soul bands in his early 20s, making a name for himself as a hotter than hot live artist. In 1985 he became lead singer and guitarist for the locally popular blues band NiteCry, and began gigging regularly throughout Northern California.\n\nCastro joined Warner Brothers\u2019 artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s, gigging all over the country. He formed the first Tommy Castro Band in 1991, releasing his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig. He hit the road hard, picking up new followers everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Television\u2019s Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label.\n\nCastro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer to massive acclaim. He won four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. His next release, 2011\u2019s Tommy Castro Presents The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue\u2013Live!, was a boisterous and searing collection of highlights from a series of live performances anchored by Castro and an all-star collection of blues giants, including Rick Estrin, Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks and Joe Louis Walker. His relentless road-dog approach\u2014gig after gig, night after night\u2014has won him loyal, lifelong fans everywhere he plays. The Washington Post says Castro is \u201cphenomenal and funky\u201d with \u201csoulful vocals and inspired blues-rock guitar.\u201d\n\nCastro formed The Painkillers in 2012, creating a lean, mean four-piece lineup, capable of delivering soul-shaking, muscular music. The band released The Devil You Know in 2014 and Method To My Madness in 2015, with critics shouting praise and admirers cheering his every move. Castro had stripped his music down to its raw essence with the new, smaller band, sounding bigger than ever. On record and on stage, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers\u2019 road-hardened, seemingly telepathic musicianship bring an unmatched passion to Castro\u2019s blue-eyed California soul and hard-rocking, good-time songs. His hometown newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle, describes Castro\u2019s music as, \u201cfunky Southern soul, big city blues and classic rock...silvery guitar licks that simultaneously sound familiar and fresh.\u201d\n\nWith months of tour dates across the U.S. and Europe, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers will be bringing the songs from their new album directly to their fans. No Depression says \u201cCastro plays gritty, string-bending blues like a runaway soul train...a glorious blend that rocks the soul and lifts the spirits.\u201d Blues Revue says simply, \u201cTommy Castro can do no wrong.\u201d With Stompin\u2019 Ground, he is clearly, once again, doing everything right.", "otherInfo": "Whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or playing the funkiest soul grooves, legendary blues and soul giant Tommy Castro knows how to ignite a crowd.

Whether performing to a festival crowd of fifty-thousand or in an intimate nightclub, Y&T's high-energy set still captivates legions of fans around the globe, proving Y&T's music timeless.\n\nOriginally formed as Yesterday and Today, the initial powerhouse quartet\u2014featuring Dave Meniketti (lead guitar/lead vocals), Phil Kennemore (bass), Leonard Haze (drums), and Joey Alves (rhythm guitar)\u2014tore through the '70s and '80s with their own brand of hard rock. After two '70s albums on London Records, they shortened their name to Y&T and released eight albums on A&M in the '80s. Two more albums with Geffen Records marked an era of change with Jimmy DeGrasso (Alice Cooper, Suicidal Tendencies, Megadeth) on drums and Stef Burns (Alice Cooper, Berlin, Huey Lewis) on guitar.\n\nWith a discography of 18 albums and three greatest hits collections, Y&T has sold over four million albums since their 1974 inception. The band received extensive airplay with hits such as Forever, Rescue Me, Mean Streak, and Summertime Girls\u2014which played in heavy rotation on MTV. Y&T songs have been featured in a multitude of movies and television shows, including Real Genius, Out of Bounds, Baywatch, and Hunter. After five top 100 albums, songs that tipped into the 40s, two Bammie Awards, and many international television appearances, Y&T's hits are still played on VH1 Classic and classic rock radio stations everywhere.\n\nIn 2010, Y&T released their first studio album in 13 years, featuring original members Dave Meniketti and Phil Kennemore, along with longtime members John Nymann on guitar and Mike Vanderhule on drums, who were each hand-picked by Kennemore and Meniketti years earlier. As the title indicates, Facemelter is a hard rockin', song-oriented album that lives up to its name. Recorded mostly live in the studio, it captures the band's raw energy and tightness for which they've become known. Featuring heavy grooves, powerful guitars and strong melodies, the band shows their versatility, delivering a range of high-energy rockers, mid-tempo head-bangers, modern rock grooves, majestic ballads, and signature Y&T rock anthems.\n\nAfter a show in the mid-'70s, a rabid fan told the band, \u201cYou melted my face.\u201d And as any Y&T fan will testify still today, Y&T's strong suit lies in their high-energy, power-packed rock 'n' roll set.\n\nWith Kennemore's untimely passing from lung cancer, the band carries on the legacy that is Y&T. Y&T continues to tour the world, featuring Dave Meniketti (guitar/lead vocals), John Nymann (guitar/vocals), Aaron Leigh (bass/vocals), and Mike Vanderhule (drums/vocals), playing songs from Facemelter as well as all the hits and fan favorites.

With lead singer Kingsborough projecting what The Bay Bridged describes as \u201cthe animation of a live wire,\u201d the rest of the band more than hold their own on stage via heavy grooves, classic riffs, and soaring solos.\n\nAccording to Leach, Kingsborough views each live performance as an opportunity to break down the walls that often separate artists and audiences:\n\n\u201cOn stage, we try to recreate the energy and emotion that inspired the songs, all with the hope that we can connect with people. We want our shows to be a conversation with our audience, a back and forth flow of energy. If we can allow them to escape for a few hours, we feel good about what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThis purposeful plan of action for the stage has paid great dividends: Kingsborough\u2019s infectious live energy has earned them opening slots for Dorothy, Joan Jett, Robert Cray, and ZZ Top.\n\nBilly Kingsborough and Leach formed Kingsborough in 2010 as a gritty rock n\u2019 roll band with roots in the blues. Inspired by their musical heroes of yesteryear and countless voyages across the Golden Gate Bridge, Kingsborough and Leach immediately began penning songs about love, loss, and lost identities.\n\nNever ones to tolerate complacency, the band are now prepared to take Kingsborough to new places. They will enter the studio in 2019 to record an album that Leach calls \u201cevidence of our sonic evolution.\u201d Their tour of Europe in early 2020 will support that album. All the while, Kingsborough intend to soak up new inspirations and influences by collaborating with some of the Bay Area\u2019s most accomplished musicians.\n\nKingsborough and Leach are eager to embrace the bliss and the blues that come from running headfirst into the unknown.

Most active in the mid to late '90s and early '00s, they formed in 1989 by students at James Madison University. Going full time in 1992, they played 200-250 shows a year for nearly the next 10 years, starting in the mid-Atlantic, and then gradually expanding their grass roots fan base until it extended across half of the U.S. The band released its first 3 albums independently, selling 30,000 CDs before signing a brief and ill-fated deal with Capricorn Records in 1995. Larger scale success came when they signed with indie label Blackbird Records who funded the recording of the 'Super Natural' album, and whose uplift venture with Sire/London Records eventually provided the radio and distribution muscle that got the breaking single \"Hooch\" to top radio stations around the world. Their peak of popularity came in 1998, when \"Hooch\" (from the 'Super Natural' album) was featured in Adam Sandler's hit movie \"The Waterboy\". From 1998 to 2000, it charted in the top 10 on Billboard's Pop and Hot AC charts, as well as top 20 on the Modern Rock charts. The band relished their 'new-found' popularity, playing radio shows and festival crowds around the country. \"Hooch\" has been heard in TV episodes of \"My Name Is Earl\", \"Yes, Dear\", \"Scrubs\" and \"Raising Hope.\" Following the AOL/Time Warner merger, and the ensuing dissolution of all joint ventures under the Warner Music Group umbrella, the band was independent once again. They released 'People Are Moving' in a co-distribution deal with What Are Records? in 2001. The band toured internationally in Japan and Korea before finally deciding to take a hiatus. They rejoined in the studio for 2 days in 2004 to record the tracks that would become 2006's 'In the Juju Underworld'. www.ecolon.com / www.thebandeverything.com", "otherInfo": "EVERYTHING w/ The Apollo Era, Footsteps"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "DJ Dials", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Fri Dec 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tickets On-sale: November 22nd, 2019 (11am PST)Public Works presents- Alice Glass (DJ set) > instagram.com/_alice_glass/+ Pictureplane > soundcloud.com/pictureplane + support from DJ Dials, Adam Kraft (Fake and Gay), & Nonsuit (Squish, Public Works) Drag Performances hosted by Fake and Gay featuring: Nicki JizzAbominatrixHexateVeda Superstar21+ | No Refunds | ATMs on siteSound by Funktion-One (Official)Stay connected: publicsf.com/connectTicket transfers: bigneon.comPublic Works 161 Erie Street | SF, CA 94103"}, {"Address": "456 Castro, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Hard", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8689754.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.435431, 37.761602], "Date": "Fri Dec 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Hdm Hard Dance Music, Hard Rock, All Forms Of Tough Music", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Q Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Denim, sweet riffs, and leg kicks.\n\nDaniel Sowards\nCody Balaschak\nThomas Sweat\nBrady Gomillion", "otherInfo": "\"Hard\" w/ DJ Haute Toddy"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Pictureplane", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7331336.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Fri Dec 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-27", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "Travis Egedy, a.k.a.

Because while the Good Show tells us to \"Trust No One,\" exceptions are granted to men with X-Files tattoos. Egedy came into his own while in Denver, Colorado. He had been pursuing a BFA in painting at Rocky Mountain College of Art + Design, but his day-to-day existence had become the medium. He lived in the legendary Rhinoceropolis warehouse, and helped convert that junkyard-adjacent DIY venue into the hub for the city's expanding art-punk underground. In that space, his music evolved fast, and Pictureplane was born into a dank stew of harsh sounds, sub-standard living, outsider art, scavenged furnishings, weird smells, and magnificent openness. By the time his remix of HEALTH's \"Lost Time\" hit the blogosphere, Egedy had grown into a sound: raw, moody dance-pop addled by rap rhythms and augmented by airy vocals. In 2009, he dropped his official debut, Dark Rift, on Lovepump United, along with a song whose title spoke volumes: \"Goth Star.\" By the year's end, in a stroke of tongue-in-cheek genius, he coined the term \"witch house\" to describe the upwelling of dark EDM owing nearly equally to legacies of Psychic TV and C+C Music Factory. In 2011, Pictureplane's Thee Physical arrived, marking a major leap forward both sonically - Egedy's voice dripping sex at the forefront of an emotive technoscape - and thematically: tracks like \"Trancegender\" and \"Breath Work\" explore sensuality and the human body with gender-dissolving aplomb. Egedy moved to Brooklyn in 2012 in order to stoke alt-rave culture from a more powerful vantage. He has since toured with Crystal Castles and Major Lazer, headlined independent fests in Europe, remixed the likes of Lil B, been remixed by Grimes, made beats for Antwon and Sole, and churned out a stream of self-releases (I.E. Thee Negative Slave Mixtape). In 2015, Pictureplane teams with Anticon to release his long-awaited next LP.

This is a real working band; music for the people, by the people. You hear the veracity in Hoyer\u2019s voice. You hear the strife of a guitar amp being pushed to its limits. You hear keyboards hammering notes home while emboldened horns soar over the top of a rhythm section akin to a freight train. The raucous funk and smooth soul emanating from the stage dutifully pays homage to the past soul giants while simultaneously charging forward, piloting themselves into the modern era. This is soul music.\n\nHoyer formed Josh Hoyer & Soul Colossal in 2012 in famed blues town Lincoln, Nebraska. The award-winning five-piece band includes some of the area's most revered and accomplished musicians. Joining Hoyer (keyboards/vocals) is Blake DeForest (trumpet), Mike Keeling (bass), Benjamin Kushner (guitar), and Larell Ware (drums). Inspired by the sounds of Stax, Motown, Muscle Shoals, New Orleans, Philly and San Francisco, the band continuously crosses musical boundaries both in style and era, and joins forces each show with a common goal - to have the crowd dancing so much they forget even their smallest troubles.\n\nOn January 18th, 2019, Josh Hoyer & Soul Colossal released Do It Now, their fourth full length studio album. The album was recorded at Silver Street in Ashland, NE and at Make Believe Studios in Omaha, NE, and mixed by James Fleege at Silver Street. Upon its initial European release in August 2018, the album drew rave reviews from European publications with Blues Magazine stating, \u201cJosh Hoyer & Soul Colossal still prove to be at the top of the contemporary soul movement.\u201d The band promoted the album on their second European tour, a 37-city outing spanning 6 different countries. Do It Now is available on vinyl, CD and all streaming platforms.\n\nJosh Hoyer & Soul Colossal hit the road again in 2018 as they traveled to over 25 states and played numerous festivals across the United States. On January 26th, 2018, Hoyer released The End of the Night, a 3-song EP and solo side project with veteran Nashville songwriters Jay Knowles (Harry Connick Jr, Blake Shelton), and Jon Coleman (Trace Adkins).\n\nIn 2017, Josh was featured as a contestant on NBC's The Voice, and the band completed their first European tour; a 27-city stint capped with a live album release from their show in Brussels, Belgium.The hard working band completed several national tours from 2015-2017, playing more than 150 shows in 32 states each year, including opening for George Clinton, Charles Bradley, Booker T Jones, and Muscle Shoals Revue.\n\nIn 2016, the magic of their live show caught the attention of producer Ken Coomer (Wilco, Uncle Tupelo), who joined with the band to record their third full-length album. Running From Love, was recorded at Nashville's historic Sound Emporium, and once again features Hoyer's trademark vocals and the band's signature groove. The album was released on April 8, 2016, on Silver Street Records, and is available on vinyl, CD, and all streaming platforms.\n\n\"If James Brown and Otis Redding had a love child, it would be Josh Hoyer.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "3411 MacArthur Blvd #3823, Oakland, CA 94602", "Artist": "Dystopia", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6610914.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.200996, 37.794029], "Date": "Fri Dec 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-27", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Melodic Metal, Metal, Sludge Metal", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Lounge 3411", "moreBioInfo": "The earliest inception of forming a band began with Bassist (then guitarist) Kishan Mulani.

The album\u2019s nine songs report back from the rich incubator that is the road, with pieces written from snippets recorded at soundchecks, gigs and jam sessions\u2014field recordings of the jazz trio in its natural habitat. On his first full trio outing, Blades is joined by guitarist Jeff Parker (Tortoise, Joey DeFrancesco, Joshua Redman) and drummer Simon Lott (Charlie Hunter, Will Bernard), both musicians who share Blades\u2019 grounding in tradition and urge to push it forward.\n\n\u201cBoth those guys can play straight-ahead jazz, they can funk, they can take it out, they can go in so many different directions,\u201d Blades says. \u201cI always had the idea in my mind that doing a trio with Jeff Parker and Simon Lott would have a cool vibe and would be very open.\u201d\n\nField Notes takes full advantage of that versatility and openness, exploring the full breadth of the organ trio\u2019s potential. \u201cOn this record, I was definitely trying to come out of the lineage but then trying to look forward at the same time,\u201d Blades says. \u201cMy whole thing is having a foot in the past and trying to have a foot in the future and to bring those two worlds together as much as possible.\u201d\n\nAt the outset of the album, Blades is dubbed \u201cthe magnificent, wonderful, sometimes tragic Wil Blades\u201d by a critic whose opinion is almost as important as Dr. Lonnie\u2019s: Blades\u2019 eight-year-old daughter, whose grandiose introduction of her father was captured while she was \u201chopped up on sugar and saying crazy, hilarious stuff.\u201d That intro showcases Blades\u2019 sense of humor, setting a warm, genial tone that carries throughout the CD\u2019s many moods. Her pronouncement leads directly into the shuffling blues of \u201cMiller\u2019s Time.\u201d The blues is a deep vein that runs through the entire album, straight through to the classic \u201cI Get the Blues When It Rains,\u201d which closes the album on a note of New Orleans soul.\n\nThat influence harkens back to Blades\u2019 roots in Chicago, where he grew up playing drums and guitar in rock and funk bands. He moved west to study jazz at the New College of California, where he studied with bassist Herbie Lewis. \u201cIt was a real old school jazz education,\u201d Blades recalls. \u201cWith Herbie, it was almost a Mr. Miyagi thing, life lessons where I\u2019d be wondering, \u2018Why am I cleaning the music room right now?\u2019 But as I got older I started to appreciate these fundamental, basic lessons that were actually very deep and useful, more so than what scale to play over what chord.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlades had begun adding the organ to his repertoire at the time, and it was Lewis who pressured him to choose one instrument to focus on. He had discovered the instrument through rock records by the likes of Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, which led him to Jimmy Smith and other jazz innovators. At the same time, Medeski Martin and Wood had emerged with a new, more radical approach to the organ trio, which Blades found equally intriguing. \u201cSomething about the sound of the organ really turned me on,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was just something about it that I really dug, and I can\u2019t really explain it.\u201d\n\nOver the past fifteen years, Blades has grown to be one of the most in-demand organ players on the Bay Area scene. In addition to leading his own trio, he works regularly in duo situations with drummers Billy Martin (Medeski Martin and Wood) and Scott Amendola (Nels Cline Singers); and in trios led by guitarist Will Bernard and drummer Stanton Moore. He\u2019s performed and recorded with a host of jazz and blues greats including Melvin Sparks, Idris Muhammad, Joe Louis Walker, Don Braden, Donald Harrison, Nicholas Payton, Karl Denson, Charlie Hunter, Jason Marsalis, Herlin Riley, and many others.\n\nNot long after Blades\u2019 arrival in California, Dr. Lonnie Smith came to town to play a week of shows at the renowned club Yoshi\u2019s with fellow organ great Jimmy McGriff. \u201cI went to every single set,\u201d Blades says. \u201cThe music was so soulful, it was addictive.\u201d Finally mustering the nerve to approach Dr. Lonnie, Blades found an eager mentor; the two continue to play duo shows to this day.\n\n\u201cA lot of older guys really want the music to be carried on, and the old school method was not jazz college, it was mentorship,\u201d Blades says. \u201cLonnie has really taken me under his wing. It\u2019s always an amazing experience to get to play with him; he really is one of my heroes.\u201d\n\nThose lessons have paid off stunningly well, as evidenced in Blades\u2019 scintillating and soulful playing throughout Field Notes, whether on the soul-into-psychedelia shimmer of \u201cChrome\u201d (developed from an improvisation with Billy Martin) or the blues-meets-electric-Miles groove of \u201cDewey\u201d or the African rhythmic accents of \u201cAddis,\u201d inspired by a 2011 trek to Ethiopia, where Blades got to work with local musicians. Stylistically, the album ranges from the alluring balladry of \u201cForgetful\u201d to the smooth, slinky R&B of \u201cRed Lanterns Are Blue,\u201d which draws inspiration from J Dilla and Patrice Rushen.\n\nWhile he wrote most of the album with his bandmates in mind, often building on fragments from jams and improvs grabbed by his iPhone, Blades pays specific tribute to both of his sidemen on a pair of tracks. \u201c(I Can\u2019t Stand) The Whole Lott of You\u201d was named for an inside joke and is another unwitting contribution from Dr. Lonnie, who intoned the title in a mock English accent upon meeting Simon Lott. The title can be (and occasionally is) sung to the tune\u2019s catchy funk chorus. Blades cedes the spotlight entirely to Jeff Parker on \u201cParks N\u2019 Wreck,\u201d a vibe-based tune driven by the organist\u2019s memorable bassline that was inspired by the guitarist\u2019s work in the hip-hop realm.\n\nAs his endorsement suggests, if Dr. Lonnie Smith and his fellow members of the B-3 pantheon are concerned about their legacy they can rest easy after hearing Field Notes. Wil Blades ably carries on the organ tradition while infusing it with modern influences, suggesting an exciting future for the instrument and for this trio.", "otherInfo": "The W-BEEZ (Will Bernard,Wil Blades,Joe Cohen,Mike Olmos+)"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Mortar", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Fri Dec 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-27", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "ALL SALES FINALNO REFUNDS/EXCHANGESJ.

He is better known for his more recent releases as J.Morgan such as Human, Demons, Livin' Lyrics and a variety of self written/produced music videos cleverly paired with captivating songs. J-Doe's name switch came in 2015 and was motivated by his growth as an artist. The name change was symbolic in the sense that J.Morgan had found himself and was no longer J-Doe (an unidentifiable person) and essentially separating the old art from the new. J.Morgan was fascinated by music and performing arts at a very young age. He started writing lyrics in elementary school but wouldn't learn to develop them into songs until his high school years at Cappuccino High School. There he would partake in endless freestyle sessions with other kids and he started to emerge himself in the local Hip Hop scene of the San Francisco area. It wasn\u2019t until he graduated from high school that he got the chance to be in professional environments where he honed his song writing skills. Since 2010, he has released mixtapes, solo albums and collaborative works with various hip hop artists from the USA and Canada. J.Morgan has been described as a \u201cprolific rhyme slinger\u201d with a \"musical diary of sorts; his songs are honest and personal and they touch on matters close to the heart.\" His 2010 mixtape Money Be Da Motivation, featured Bay Area legend San Quinn. His 2011 mixtape More Bars In More Places included the popular song Vodka In My Coffee which resulted in his first professional music video filmed and cut by 4Reel Films (Josh Blacman). From 2012-2014 he released 6 collaborative albums with recording artist and producer Heroe Diah Pyles titled J-Doe As Captain Morgan, Make It Count, The Way I'm Feeling Now, Read Between The Lines, Faded, and More Problems Than Money. In 2013 J.Morgan and Heroe opened up shows for Ras Kass, The Jacka, San Quinn, Berner, Sellassie and Love Rance. In 2015 he made the name switch to J.Morgan and started a new era of his music. He began working with producer/song writer Bryce Graven aka Shiesty which helped develope a distinct style and sound. Together they created J.Morgan's debut solo album Human. Shorty after the Human release Morgan traveled across the United States on the Bourne Madd Tour performing alongsid J.Lately, Telli Prego, and Hugo Monster. In 2016, J.Morgan was apart of events that included many emerging emcees along with Equipto and Locksmith. J.Morgan released a two part EP titled Demons and continued producing cinematic music videos like The Trap and Echo. J.Morgan was born April 6th 1989 in Daly City, California. He lived between San Bruno and San Mateo until the age of 7 when his family moved to Santa Rosa, California, where he resided until the age of 14. His parents divorce ultimately lead to another move back to San Bruno,California which is where he attended and graduated high school. He graduated from Pennisula High School in 2007.

Having impressed the promoter of Gategrasher while playing at an afterparty in Ibiza, Greg was asked to play at Space the following week. Very shortly afterwards, Greg broke through the UK trance scene playing at major shows such as Gatecrasher, Godskitchen, Slinky, Inside Out, Goodgreef, and Passion. What was every aspiring DJ\u2019s dream to travel the world soon became a reality for Greg. He was crisscrossing the globe flying from New York City to Sydney to Ibiza to Shanghai to Buenos Aires to London playing to massive crowds. Greg recorded his first \u201cLive As album\u201d on Discover from the mega Planet Love festival in Northern Ireland, which captured Greg's energy as a DJ and was featured as \"Album of the Month\" in Mixmag. Soon the prestigious BBC Radio One came calling and Greg appeared as a guest on Eddie Halliwell\u2019s radio show. It came as no surprise when Greg was voted into DJ Mag Top 100 poll coming in at number 82. This was a huge accomplishment for such a young talent. As Greg\u2019s DJing career was taking off, so were his productions. Catching the attention of John Digweed with his remix of \u201cHeaven Scent\u201d, Greg solidified himself as a producer when his remix claimed the number one spot on Beatport for over a month. His remix was championed by Sasha, Eric Prydz, Paul van Dyk, Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren and John Digweed. Greg was then snapped up by Paul van Dyk for his label Vandit. His first release \u201cStadium\u201d was a huge success which became Mixmag's Cream Ibiza anthem of 2008. Greg was also chosen by Paul van Dyk to remix his track \u201cNew York City\u201d which appeared on his \u201cHands on In Between\u201d album. Working tirelessly in the studio, Greg started to produce hit after hit. His track \u201cGlobal Code\u201d on Vandit was featured in every Paul Van Dyk\u2019s set for close to a year and his following single Show Time for Dutch heavy weights Spinnin was No. 2 on Beatport. Having teamed up with the lead singer Paul Draper from Mansun in 2010 to remake their classic track \u201cWide Open Space,\" it became the track of the year having crossed over to daytime Radio One with support from Scott Mills and Vernon Kay and was chosen by Mixmag as their tune of the month. This track was later snapped up by major label EMI for a full release. 2011 saw Greg up the game once again when his remix of Everything But The Girl \u2013 Missing was signed to Warner Music. Greg\u2019s mix was released alongside Fedde Le Grand\u2019s and reached No. 1 on Beatport and was No. 1 on Australia\u2019s leading radio station Radio Metro. Greg had three more top ten hits with Spinnin' Records, Knight Moves , Game Face and Sunrise. Greg and Simon Patterson teamed up with English vocalist Bo Bruce to create the anthem \u201c Come To Me,\" this was an instant Ibiza anthem at Amnesia and Space and across the globe. Wanting to explore the darker side of his sounds, Greg developed his R.I.C.O alias to bring out the deeper underground techno sound. As Greg explains, \u201cI think it\u2019s good to try new things and to develop yourself in the studio, I love growing as an artist and developing,\u201d after receiving great feedback from fans and fellow DJs of the tracks released under the R.I.C.O alias. Game Face and Afraid Of The Dark have been firm favourites of Markus Schultz featuring on his Global DJ Broadcast show several times. Greg\u2019s diversity also saw him snapped up by Gareth Emery\u2019s Garuda for his debut release with Crazy For You in 2012. Supported regularly by the likes of Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery, Paul van Dyk, Ferry Corsten, Sander van Doorn, Above and Beyond, Greg's many achievements, alongside his outstanding technical ability will ensure he continues to reach great heights.

Yet she still remains impossible to pigeon hole, taking cues from a vast range of influences. Meredith\u2019s 2014 single \u2018Jumpin Beds\u2019 and the rapturous way it was received solidified the path forward for this talented songstress. Those hungry for another dose of Meredith\u2019s lo-fi loveliness rejoiced as the singer released single \u2018Levels\u2019 in the last quarter of 2015 as well as an intricate video accompaniment. The response to \u2018Levels\u2019 was ecstatic with the track receiving airplay on triple j, 200k plays on Spotify and an entry into the Spotify UK Viral 50 charts. The video also received copious amounts of love from rage and the blogosphere. Supporting the likes of Avaberee, Machine Age, Timberwolf and The Once (CAN) in 2015, Meredith surfaced with a brand new live show setup for 2016. In March she released new single \u2018How Could You Believe That\u2019 - a reflection on feeling powerless in supporting a friend who finds themselves stuck in a toxic relationship \u2013 and will release her self-titled debut EP on Friday June 17. With a San Cisco support gig under her belt in 2016 and an EP launch just around the corner, this hugely talented singer/songwriter is fast becoming one of the alternative pop world\u2019s most enthralling new muses.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

He's a fine player with an attractive sound (influenced a bit by Grover Washington, Jr.) who often caresses melodies, putting a lot of emotion into his solos. Because he does not improvise much (sticking mostly to predictable melody statements), his music largely falls outside of jazz. However, because he is listed at the top of \"contemporary jazz\" charts and is identified with jazz in the minds of the mass public, he is classified as jazz.\n\nKenny Gorelick started playing professionally with Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra in 1976. He recorded with Cold, Bold & Together (a Seattle-based funk group) and freelanced locally. After graduating from the University of Washington, Kenny G worked with Jeff Lorber Fusion, making two albums with the group. Soon he was signed to Arista, recording his debut as a leader in 1982. His fourth album, Duotones (which included the very popular \"Songbird\"), made him into a star. Soon he was in demand for guest appearances on recordings of such famous singers as Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, and Natalie Cole. Kenny G's own records have sold remarkably well, particularly Breathless, which has easily topped eight million copies in the U.S.; his total album sales top 30 million copies. The holiday album Miracles, released in 1994, and 1996's Moment continued the momentum of his massive commercial success. He also recorded his own version of the Celine Dion/Titanic smash \"My Heart Will Go On\" in 1998, but the following year he released Classics in the Key of G, a collection of jazz standards like \"'Round Midnight\" and \"Body and Soul,\" possibly to reclaim some jazz credibility.\n\nFaith: A Holiday Album was released that same year, followed by a limited-edition re-release of the 1997 Greatest Hits disc. In 2002 Kenny G dipped into tropical territory with Paradise, which featured guest appearances by Brian McKnight and Chant\u00e9 Moore. This was followed by a music video collection, another holiday album, entitled Wishes, and, in 2003, a second greatest-hits collection, Ultimate Kenny G. Perhaps in a bid to shake up his discography a bit, in 2004 Kenny G released At Last...The Duets Album, which featured \"duets\" with LeAnn Rimes and Chaka Khan. Two years later, smooth jazz's king of the soprano sax returned to a purely instrumental approach on the brassy, big-band-inspired albums Holiday Collection and I'm in the Mood for Love; 2006 was also the year the artist was dubbed the best golfer in music by Golf Digest, beating out Vince Gill for the number one spot. In 2008, Kenny G released the Latin-inspired Rhythm and Romance. The sax player next drifted toward R&B for 2010's Heart and Soul, which featured guest vocals from Robin Thicke and Babyface. A collection with Rahul Sharma called Namaste followed in 2012, and in 2015 Kenny G released a tribute to bossa nova titled Brazilian Nights, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. In 2017, G kept up his active concert schedule, even pairing with fellow smooth jazz legend George Benson for the limited engagement Breezin' & Breathless Tour.", "otherInfo": "Food and Full Bar Available for PurchaseJAZZ SUPERSTAR KENNY G RETURNS FOR A YEAR-END HOLIDAY RESIDENCY.Kenny will be here for multiple shows over five nights leading up to the New Years Eve celebration performance.Sit down to dinner and wine in an intimate, up close and personal evening with one of the most iconic and best-selling instrumental musicians of all time, Kenny G.With Sold Out shows across the globe, Kenny is ending 2019s year long run of international performances in the picturesque backdrop of the Napa Valley.

On their new album, \"With All Its Thorns,\" they delve deeper into country music's tradition of storytelling with songs about betrayal (\"Secrets\"), murder (\"In Red\"), and grief (\"Ghostship\"), with a whole lot of heartbreak in between. Their twangy honesty shines through in straightforward arrangements, crystalline harmonies, and spare instrumentation. Beware their catchy hooks and sweet melodies - these stray puppy tunes will follow you home and become your most steadfast companions.\n\nLaura Benitez, songwriter, lead singer and founder of Laura Benitez and the Heartache, has been making her mark on stage and screen since 2000. She spent several years appearing in soap operas and commercials in Los Angeles before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2004, diving into the region\u2019s rich Americana and Roots music scenes. Taking her musical cues from the heavily rock influenced Bakersfield sound, and her lyric inspiration from her favorite songwriters Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn, Laura began writing songs in 2008. She released her first album, \"For Duty or for Love\" on her own Copperhead Records label in 2010.\n\nIn 2012 she recruited the multi-talented singer, songwriter, and drummer Michele Kappel-Stone (Kirby Grips/Tippy Canoe/Heartache Sisters) into the band, and was lucky enough to secure the talents of Bob Spector (The Spectones) and Ted O'Connell (The GoldDiggers, Moonshine Maybelline) on twang guitar and bass. These four joined together with Ian Taylor Sutton (The Walcotts, Misisipi Mike, Secret Town) on pedal steel to record their critically acclaimed full length album, \"Heartless Woman,\" which was released in 2014.\n\n2015 saw the band touring to festivals in Southern California and Nashville, but also saw some changes in personnel, with Michele Kappel-Stone and Ted O'Connell turning their full-time attention to other projects.

The Bay Area band delivers cinematic songs with timeless hooks anchored by Kelly Finnigan\u2019s soulful organ and powerhouse vocals. Their sound is inspired equally by classic soul, heavy funk, psychedelic rock, and classic American songwriting. The band\u2019s main members live just North of San Francisco, CA in Marin county, a place revered among artists, surfers, hippies and musicians; three of them grew up here. The band members simultaneously revere and honor the Bay Area\u2019s colorblind and highly diverse musical tradition that dates back to Haight/Ashbury\u2019s psychedelic revolution and Sly Stone and the Family Stone\u2019s multiracial, funky grab-bag. Soulful vocals, funky drum-breaks, psychedelic guitar licks and fuzz bass intermingle effortlessly across the band\u2019s catalogue, most effortlessly on their newest EP: \u035eMirrors\u035f. Mirrors delivers a six-song fix to fiending fans and curious newcomers in advance of a new Monophonics full-length later in 2018. The release is all cover tunes with some well-known songs mixed in with some seriously deep cuts, all band favorites. \u035eSound of Sinning\u035f (Transistor Sound Records, 2015), the band\u2019s second full-length album since lead singer, producer and keyboard player, Kelly Finningan joined the band.\n\nEvolving from their psychedelic soul roots with \u035eIn Your Brain,\u035f (Ubiquity, 2012), \u035eSound of Sinning\u035f displays the bands\u2019 appreciation for classic song craft and Summer of Love pop-soul-psychedelia.

Ryan Scott and Mike Rinta\u2019s horn and string arrangements add accents and sonic colors to the tracks, completing the soul symphony.

As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland. He began playing in a variety of Bay Area blues and soul bands in his early 20s, making a name for himself as a hotter than hot live artist. In 1985 he became lead singer and guitarist for the locally popular blues band NiteCry, and began gigging regularly throughout Northern California.\n\nCastro joined Warner Brothers\u2019 artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s, gigging all over the country. He formed the first Tommy Castro Band in 1991, releasing his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig. He hit the road hard, picking up new followers everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Television\u2019s Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label.\n\nCastro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer to massive acclaim. He won four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. His next release, 2011\u2019s Tommy Castro Presents The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue\u2013Live!, was a boisterous and searing collection of highlights from a series of live performances anchored by Castro and an all-star collection of blues giants, including Rick Estrin, Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks and Joe Louis Walker. His relentless road-dog approach\u2014gig after gig, night after night\u2014has won him loyal, lifelong fans everywhere he plays. The Washington Post says Castro is \u201cphenomenal and funky\u201d with \u201csoulful vocals and inspired blues-rock guitar.\u201d\n\nCastro formed The Painkillers in 2012, creating a lean, mean four-piece lineup, capable of delivering soul-shaking, muscular music. The band released The Devil You Know in 2014 and Method To My Madness in 2015, with critics shouting praise and admirers cheering his every move. Castro had stripped his music down to its raw essence with the new, smaller band, sounding bigger than ever. On record and on stage, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers\u2019 road-hardened, seemingly telepathic musicianship bring an unmatched passion to Castro\u2019s blue-eyed California soul and hard-rocking, good-time songs. His hometown newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle, describes Castro\u2019s music as, \u201cfunky Southern soul, big city blues and classic rock...silvery guitar licks that simultaneously sound familiar and fresh.\u201d\n\nWith months of tour dates across the U.S. and Europe, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers will be bringing the songs from their new album directly to their fans. No Depression says \u201cCastro plays gritty, string-bending blues like a runaway soul train...a glorious blend that rocks the soul and lifts the spirits.\u201d Blues Revue says simply, \u201cTommy Castro can do no wrong.\u201d With Stompin\u2019 Ground, he is clearly, once again, doing everything right.", "otherInfo": "Whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or playing the funkiest soul grooves, legendary blues and soul giant Tommy Castro knows how to ignite a crowd. Over the course of his still-unfolding career, the guitarist, vocalist and songwriter has released 15 albums ranging from horn-fueled soul and R&B to piping hot blues to fiery rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. He\u2019s performed all over the world, earning countless fans with his legendary, sweat-drenched, exhilarating live shows.

Couple that with all their music friends joining in on the fun, and this new CD makes a very strong case for Northern California being the new torch-bearing center of the classic Chicago and Texas blues sound.\nSix stellar originals tell the couple\u2019s individual and combined personal histories in an honest and cosmic way. Beth & RW\u2019s love of the classic blues vibe pays off and yet, these songs could easily be covered by well-known singers in many roots music idioms.\nNestled alongside are songs by their mid-20th century heroes Jimmy Reed (lead track, \u201cThere\u2019ll Be a Day\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t That Loving You Baby\u201d), Memphis Minnie (\u201cLookin\u2019 the World Over\u201d), Big Bill Broonzy (\u201cLonesome Road Blues\u201d), jump blues brother-sister act, Buddy & Ella Johnson (\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Stop It\u201d) and Memphis Slim (\u201cMother Earth.\u201d)\nRed\u2019s Blues has a finger-poppin\u2019 attitude\u2014straight outta the afore-mentioned golden years when blues, R&B and swing all meshed together and dance floors every night were filled with snake hips and slow drags. Beth, with her sensual, southern voice and classy behind-the-beat phrasing is more a Julie London or Bobbie Gentry-styled singer: smoky with languid, sexy sophistication. She can swing too, just check out the big fun on \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Ya Stop It.\u201d This rich nightclub feel is missed on too many modern singers. The yearning confidentiality, the wise heart that Beth brings to her true-life stories reveal tales of youth seen through grown up reflection.\nRW, who has not lost his hometown Rome, Georgia accent has this quality also. Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is back at the uniquely intimate Back Room in Berkeley.

His easy charm and dirty delivery endear him to audiences every night at The Comedy Cellar, The Stand and Stand Up New York. He\u2019s no stranger to the rest of America, either, regularly headlining across the country and playing festivals including Bonaroo, Jager's Korn tour, Rock Star Energy Drink's Mayhem Fest, Gathering of the Juggalos and Funny or Die\u2019s Oddball Festival. Jay has also recently been featured on This Is Not Happening with Ari Shaffir, Comedy Underground with Dave Attell, FX\u2019s Louie, Inside Amy Schumer, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nThis last year, Jay's Comedy Central hour special \"Big Jay Oakerson: Live At Webster Hall\" premiered. Filmed at the legendary music venue in New York City providing the perfect heavy metal vibe for the show. Jay's comedy is raw, compelling and honest to the core, as he takes viewers on a journey of brutal truths about his relationship with his teenage daughter, sexual tension between him and his best friend Dave and advise to women on how to delicately handle a man with an unfortunate penis size. His second album with Comedy Central Records, The Crowdwork Sessions: What\u2019s Your F@#king Deal?! Recorded in 2013 live at The Stand, it captures Jay\u2019s raunchy, off-the-cuff essence with a full hour of crowdwork. It joins Jay\u2019s first album, An American Storyteller, a one-hour onslaught of unbridled awesomeness and raunchy rock n' roll hilarity recorded at Stand Up New York in 2009.\n\nOakerson has hosted 2 seasons of \"What's Your F@#king Deal?! Crowdwork & Off The Cuff Comedy\" on Seeso. Jay asks the audience to let go of pretension and leave egos at the door as he leads a pack of comics in a completely improvised show based on interactions with the crowd. The atmosphere is loose and no-holds-barred, so you'll see a side of the performers you've never seen before.\n\nHe is co-host of two wildly popular podcasts - \u201cThe Most Offensive Podcast on Earth\u201d Legion of Skanks with Luis J.

This rich new trove of sharp-witted songs showcases a bristling, late 70\u2019s \u2013 early 80\u2019s power pop punk aesthetic which hits as hard as it did at the band\u2019s formation 17 years ago. Eight albums (one platinum and three gold) and a barrel full of anthemic hit songs later, Cracker endures, using their ability to weave decades of influences into an album that is seamlessly riveting. In Sunrise\u2026, long-time partners David Lowery and Johnny Hickman, 12-year Cracker drummer Frank Funaro and bassist Sal Maida (since 2006), train a watchful eye on the current socio-musical landscape as they weave an eerie yet strangely soothing story of escapism, apocalypse and renewal. Friends John Doe, Patterson Hood and Adam Duritz (whose mega-band Counting Crows was once produced by Lowery) make spirited guest appearances. The recording was helmed by Athens, GA-based producer/engineer David Barbe, a longtime friend of Lowery who has manned consoles for the likes of Son Volt and the alt-Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers. The explosive title track that wraps the 11-song collection is thematic, belying its seemingly cheery title to take a tough-edged look at the precarious times we live in. Ever the observant storyteller, Lowery calls it like he sees it: the affluence and wealth America seemed to have these past decades was built on a mirage. The sun shines a harsh light on a landscape of decay. The golden age, the promised land, the land of milk and honey, never materialized. For Sunrise\u2026, Lowery and Hickman took a new approach to their creative process, joining Funaro and Maida to write most songs from scratch. (Whereas on previous albums, Lowery and Hickman would bring near-finished tracks to the rest of the band.) Cracker were self-disciplined\u2014 writing together one week every two months, between tours, for a year. The goal was to work on two songs per day\u2014and somehow, the combined force of their distinctive and mutual influences gave rise to a crackling, raw musical factory of sorts. Says Lowery, \u201cThe coolest part of making the new album was the self-imposed time structure we created, the fact that we all gathered to write these songs like it was an actual job. At one point, when we had four songs that needed lyrics, Johnny and I went to the legendary punk studio, The Blasting Room, in Ft. Collins CO, and rented the B room, where we stayed until we had the right words. It was refreshing to do it this way, to challenge ourselves to write with the clock ticking. It was like starting a band and committing to a rehearsal time. We weren\u2019t kicking back on an island in the Caribbean, waiting for the muse to hit us. We got down to work, found the punk and glam rock in our blood and woke up to Sunrise In The Land Of Milk And Honey.\u201d Considering drummer Funaro\u2019s background playing with The Dictators and Joey Ramone, and bassist Maida\u2019s background with Roxy Music and Sparks, it was inevitable that the new album would acquire its own unique edge. \u201cIt was a little different involving Frank and Sal\u2019s musical tastes and their background from the get-go,\u201d says Lowery, \u201cbut this led us to realize the common element we all share. We all came of age playing power pop-punk and that early new wave stuff. Once we got on this path, it started surfacing in so many songs that it became a thematic element for the whole project. We all started playing music in that era so we weren\u2019t surprised when those sounds started rising up. Sunrise\u2026isn\u2019t the \u2018Cracker punk record\u2019 but it\u2019s definitely got that time stamp, the \u201978-\u201983 flavors, all over it. The other thing we did differently was actually playing all the songs in concert before ever committing them to digital. Most bands do the album first, then take the tunes on the road.\u201d \u201cIn a lot of ways, the methodology behind this album brought us all back to when we all started our early bands, when the opportunity to write and record albums came after playing tons of live shows,\u201d adds the Richmond, VA-based singer. \u201cI think one of the reasons Cracker has survived this long when so many of the bands that started in the early 90s faded is that we\u2019ve always made the record we want to hear right now. We\u2019ve always had the belief and confidence that others will feel like we do. Eclecticism was the norm for bands in the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s and into the 80\u2019s, and that freedom leads to great bursts of creativity and the potential to make classic albums that stand the test of time.\u201d The first album track explodes with a slicing guitar riff from Hickman. \u201cYalla Yalla\u201d is a colorful rumination on an Arabic phrase meaning, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Lowery heard U.S. soldiers greeting each other this way at the Atlanta airport. \u201cLike rock musicians, soldiers in every era have their own language of bravado and machismo,\u201d he says. The band dives deep into the punk on the frenetic \u201cShow Me How This Thing Works,\u201d a song inspired by Lowery helping a friend with a quantitative finance problem; the singer is proud that he was once a budding mathematician. \u201cTurn On Tune In Drop Out With Me\u201d is a lilting pop/rock reminder that in these precarious times, many may feel like returning to the bold escapism of the 60s, of the hippies who left the rat race behind to \u201cdrop out\u201d into spiritual refuge. The blistering \u201cHand Me My Inhaler\u201d finds its hapless protagonist blustering at an ex-girlfriend's door, \u201cgonna reform the band without you.\" Hickman says of the blues-funk \u201cI Could Be Wrong, I Could Be Right,\u201d \u201cWhen I hand David a melody like this one, I have no idea where he\u2019s going to take it, and I love that. Suddenly the devil and members of the Lewis and Clark expedition were caught up together in some sort of a psychedelic love conspiracy.\u201d \u201cTime Machine,\u201d a black-booted, Celtic-riffed, early-punk kick to the jaw of any pretenders, was inspired by a conversation Hickman had with Black Flag and Descendants drummer Bill Stevenson (who co-founded The Blasting Room studios). Hickman and Stevenson both realized that they had been caught up in the same early 80s punk rock riot at a legendary Dead Kennedys show. It\u2019s a message to today's punks that they perhaps couldn\u2019t have survived what the previous generation endured. \u201cI took a couple of billy club hits that night,\u201d Hickman says, \u201cI got off easy.\u201d Punk-and-now-Americana legend John Doe harmonizes on the throbbing, surf guitar driven, \u201cWe All Shine a Light.\u201d This swarming, Buzzcocks-like rocker is a comment on multicuturalism and tolerance, by way of an ode to Pakistan\u2019s cricket team, the Peshawar Panthers. Patterson Hood of the Drive-By Truckers duets with Lowery on the swampy, folk-Americana of \u201cFriends,\u201d a drunken tale of dysfunctional but loving friendship. One of the album\u2019s more poignant moments arrives when Adam Duritz guests, singing alongside Lowery on the romantically selfless \u201cDarling One.\u201d The stomping, harmonica-laden \u201cHey Brett, You Know What Time It Is\u201d came from a sardonic line uttered to Lowery by Built To Spill\u2019s Brett Netson, during an exchange of ever-escalating shockeries. Lowery recalls, \u201cHe walked into our dressing room and joked, \u2018Will we know when it's time to start dragging rich people from their cars and killin' em'?\u2019 For Frank and me, it grew into a text message exchange and later a song.\u201d A brief rundown of Cracker\u2019s history: Lowery, in the mid-80s, in Santa Cruz, California, formed Camper Van Beethoven, and their \u201cTake the Skinheads Bowling\u201d became an instant college radio staple. When CVB disbanded on tour in Sweden, following their second major label release, Lowery formed Cracker with his longtime friend Johnny Hickman. (The pair had met on the local music scene as teenagers in Redlands, CA.) Cracker\u2019s emergent sound had less in common with Camper\u2019s exotic excursions and was more in synch with the Kinks and Southern roots music. They released their self-titled debut on Virgin, and following the #1 Modern Rock hit \u201cTeen Angst (What The World Needs Now),\u201d the band became a minor commercial sensation (complete with then-significant MTV exposure). The platinum-selling Kerosene Hat contained the enormous, era-defining hit single \u201cLow,\u201d as well as \u201cGet Off This,\u201d and \u201cEurotrash Girl.\u201d When the dust settled, Cracker found themselves with an ever-growing, devoted following both in the U.S. (where fans refer to themselves as Crumbs) and throughout Europe. Today the band stays well connected to yet another generation of fans via internet, many of whom were kids when these alt-rock godfathers were first ruling rock radio.

The raucous funk and smooth soul emanating from the stage dutifully pays homage to the past soul giants while simultaneously charging forward, piloting themselves into the modern era.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Bbymutha", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8313745.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Sat Dec 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-28", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative Rap, Female Rap, Hip Hop, Rap", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "underground rap mom.", "otherInfo": "Public Works presents THE PAWTY"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "DJ Lady Ryan", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Sat Dec 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-28", "Genre": "Genres: Techno, Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Public Works presents THE PAWTY"}, {"Address": "101 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Womp Rat", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9173782.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sat Dec 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "Story-telling through sound design.

A few years later Odetto was a semi-finalist for Guitar Center\u2019s King of the Blues. He was also featured in Guitar Player magazine as an artist to watch.

Not long after Ryan began learning how to play guitar, he joined a local rock band as the lead guitar player and entered various local battle of the bands contests. The first band he ever played in was \"Referral\". They entered into a contest a local classic rock radio station hosted by the famous Greg Kihn was putting on called The Last Band Standing. Ryan and his band ended up winning the contest in the 18/under category and got to play 5-6 songs live on air with Greg Kihn on his morning show. \"It felt surreal at only 14 yrs old being able to play live on the air with Greg Kihn for an audience of around a million people. It couldn't have been a better experience for me and the band\", Ryan recalls. At 16 years old, Ryan really began to find a love and passion for country music. \"I have some family who loved country music and it really just grew on me over time the more I was around it. You would think I would get sick of it from constantly hearing my family listening to it but it actually just made me love this genre of music even more.\" It wasn't until around the age of 18 years old that Ryan began to develop himself as a vocalist. \"I would bring my guitar to play at a friends bonfire and while I loved to play the guitar all night, I felt like there was something missing. I really wanted to start singing,\" Ryan recalls. At that point, Ryan had a grown passion for country music and began uploading videos to YouTube of himself singing and playing popular country songs. As Ryan began to progress and get better he wanted to take things to the next level and that was starting a country band. Now at the age of 23, Ryan has been playing regularly at various country bars across Northern California along with his band and strong female vocalist, Cece Bamburg. About one year ago, Ryan released his first EP to iTunes and Spotify titled as \"Ryan 'n' Cece\". The three song EP includes two originals written by Ryan and one cover song which were all produced by Ben Araiza of Def Moose Studios based out of San Jose, CA. Ryan is currently working on a brand new EP which will feature him as a solo artist. \"Music is my ultimate passion and you never know where it's going to take you.

The one-woman army is marching her muscular take on techno all over the globe, winning fans not only with her music, but her way of being, that\u2019s at once uncensored, inclusive, and fierce.\n\nWith her trademark shock of untamed dark hair, the Nigeria-born artist can be spotted in a DJ booth by profile alone, rocking crowds before she even drops a record. In-demand all over the world, Moudaber has played everything from intimate after-hours clubs; to revered nightclub institutions like Space, DC10, Output and Stereo; to massive festival stages, including Glastonbury, Electric Daisy Carnival (hosting her own MoodZONE stages), and two appearances at Coachella. She\u2019s been featured by the New York Times and CNN, named \u201cone to watch\u201d by Billboard and Paper magazine, and has graced the cover of electronic music magazines in several countries. Her weekly radio show In The MOOD - which Moudaber hosts with her unmistakable husk-and-honey voice - won Best Online Music Show in the 2016 Online Radio Awards and is syndicated across over 80 stations in 50 countries, commanding over 16 million listeners worldwide. She has over a million social followers who she dialogues with daily, sharing candid thoughts on music, work, and life.\n\nMood Records, the imprint she founded in 2013, is a vessel for her own music, and that of other artists who complement her style - which is percussive, deep, and dynamic. She linked up with Skunk Anansie frontwoman Skin for the \u201cBreed\u201d EP in 2015. Backed by a set of high-fashion, black-and-white music videos, it fused their two worlds of techno and rock to critical acclaim, and was submitted and accepted into the 2015 GRAMMYS for consideration. The subsequent \u201cBreed the RMXS\u201d EP (2016) contained a powerhouse of remixers including Carl Craig, Fur Coat, Hector, Jamie Jones, Paco Osuna, Pan-Pot, and Scuba. Moudaber has also logged releases with mentor Carl Cox\u2019s Intec, Adam Beyer\u2019s Drumcode (including full album \u201cBelieve\u201d in 2013), and Jamie Jones\u2019s Hot Creations. Her hit remix of Alcatraz house classic \u201cGive Me Luv\u201d (on Deep Dish\u2019s Yoshitoshi) used bass, drums and silence to make a moment so big, it was used by DJs of all stripes. The track won \"Best Tech House/Techno Track\" at the 2016 International Dance Music Awards, and was the No. 1 techno track of 2015 on online retailer Beatport, making it one of the year\u2019s Top 20 tracks overall.\n\nNicole Moudaber often brings different elements of her style and taste to life under the MOOD banner, showing her roots as a party promoter, and a New York City clubber during the golden age of the resident DJ. In 2014, she headlined the sold-out MoodRAW tour, set in in off-the-grid warehouse venues from Los Angeles to London. During Miami Music Week, the annual industry confab in South Beach, she hosts MOOD showcases, capturing both the pool and after-hours party vibes with packed lineups of superstar friends (like Carl Cox and Danny Tenaglia). She curated MoodZONE festival stages at the 2016 Electric Daisy Carnival in New York and 2017 EDC Las Vegas, and was a fixture of the annual BPM Festival, Mexico, playing the 10-day event\u2019s official closing party in 2016 as well as curating her own BPMOOD event in 2017.\n\nA true global citizen, Moudaber resides in London and Ibiza, with frequent stopovers in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. She supports NYC\u2019s Lower Eastside Girls Club, which helps disadvantaged young women access the tools they need to pursue their passion for music.

Releasing standout music alongside fellow tropical house founders Kygo, Bakermat and Robin Schulz, his refreshing and innovative sound has influenced the likes of Lost Frenquencies, Kungs, Ofenbach and many more; cementing him as a pioneer of the tropical and melodic house genre.\n\nHailing from Croix, Northern France, Cedric began studying music theory as a child before later becoming immersed in electronic music as a teenager, learning to DJ and subsequently working on his own original productions. Discovering his passion for electronic music, his immense appreciation for Sweden\u2019s booming dance music culture inspired him to eventually settle on the moniker Klingande, taken from the Swedish word for sounding \u2013 something that continues to cause confusion as to his origins to this day! Committed to furthering his vocation, Cedric moved to London where he spent a year studying at the famed Point Blank Music College, learning every facet of music production and experiencing multiple genres, a testament to his drive and determination to reach the top of his game.\n\nReturning to his hometown back in 2012, Klingande holed himself up in the studio, honing his now signature sound to unveil his delightful debut single \u2018Punga\u2019. However, it was his follow up \u2018Jubel\u2019 in 2013 that rightfully propelled the young producer into the spotlight. Truly embodying the Swedish word it was named after, \u2018Jubel\u2019 instantly captivated listeners with its joyous and uplifting sound, becoming one of the first standout tracks of its genre. Since then, the record has amassed over 150 million views on YouTube, an additional 21 million plays across SoundCloud and a further 176 million on Spotify, as well as taking the #1 spot in 30 countries to become the most Shazamed track across Europe.\n\nAfter 3 years on tour, Klingande released his short documentary \u20183 years of Music & Love\u2019 on MTV to celebrate and tell the story of his success \u2018Jubel\u2019 which introduced his follow up single \u2018Losing U\u2019. Alongside this, he is now the host of his own radio show in the \u2018House of Chill\u2019 series on Sirius FM. Aired monthly; the show brings in millions of listeners every month from around the globe.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it was not long before the burgeoning star caught the attention of talent scouts and tastemakers around the globe, and as the praise rolled in thick and fast, so too did the requests. His guest mixes have been applauded by the likes of Billboard and Dancing Astronaut and he has been called upon for remix treatments by everyone from Avicii & Wyclef Jean to Parov Stelar.\n\nA musician in the truest sense of the word, what sets Klingande apart from the rest is his dedication to producing unusual and mesmerizing soundscapes. Constantly introducing instruments not usually encountered in typical electronic music, his third official single \u2018RIVA (Restart The Game)\u2019 - released earlier in 2015 and featuring French singer Broken Back - even saw him experiment with the harmonica to almighty applause. He followed up with the brilliant \u2018Losing U\u2019 introducing a quartet of chords. Bringing his saxophone player, and Violin player since end of 2016, to every show he plays, Klingande ensures this experimental attitude resonates throughout his live performances and it is therefore no surprise that he has been called upon to play at major festivals, from Ultra Music Festival in Miami to Tomorrowland and TomorrowWorld.\n\n2016 was one of Klingande\u2019s most prolific years to date. He released \u2018Losing U\u2019 in February and \u2018Somewhere New\u2019 in August, which amassed over 23 million streams on Spotify alone and reached Platinum status in Sweden. Known for his innovative productions, Klingande even further by producing the first facebook live stream music video in history for this single, alongside At Night Studios. The video impressively went according to plan as 40 people came together to tell a wonderful story through 11 different environments.\n\nOver the past year, Klingande has been working on his live tour where he brings out musicians playing the guitar, violin, drums and of course saxophone \u2013 creating a truly immersive live experience. With this new concept, Klingande played a monumental live show last year at the Roundhouse, London with Kungs and Felix Jaehn, and brought it to festivals like Lollapalooza. 2017 sees Klingande keep his busy tour schedule up across the US, South America and Europe with already announced dates at Tomorrowland, Parookaville, Mysteryland and returning to Ibiza in the summer.

Couple that with all their music friends joining in on the fun, and this new CD makes a very strong case for Northern California being the new torch-bearing center of the classic Chicago and Texas blues sound.\nSix stellar originals tell the couple\u2019s individual and combined personal histories in an honest and cosmic way. Beth & RW\u2019s love of the classic blues vibe pays off and yet, these songs could easily be covered by well-known singers in many roots music idioms.\nNestled alongside are songs by their mid-20th century heroes Jimmy Reed (lead track, \u201cThere\u2019ll Be a Day\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t That Loving You Baby\u201d), Memphis Minnie (\u201cLookin\u2019 the World Over\u201d), Big Bill Broonzy (\u201cLonesome Road Blues\u201d), jump blues brother-sister act, Buddy & Ella Johnson (\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Stop It\u201d) and Memphis Slim (\u201cMother Earth.\u201d)\nRed\u2019s Blues has a finger-poppin\u2019 attitude\u2014straight outta the afore-mentioned golden years when blues, R&B and swing all meshed together and dance floors every night were filled with snake hips and slow drags. Beth, with her sensual, southern voice and classy behind-the-beat phrasing is more a Julie London or Bobbie Gentry-styled singer: smoky with languid, sexy sophistication. She can swing too, just check out the big fun on \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Ya Stop It.\u201d This rich nightclub feel is missed on too many modern singers. The yearning confidentiality, the wise heart that Beth brings to her true-life stories reveal tales of youth seen through grown up reflection.\nRW, who has not lost his hometown Rome, Georgia accent has this quality also. Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Join Red\u2019s Blues for our first show at Lagunitas Brewing Company in Petaluma.

In an era when so much pop music is the product of digital processing and vocal pro-tooling, Straight No Chaser is the real deal \u2013 the captivating sound of ten unadulterated human voices coming together to make extraordinary music that is moving people in a fundamental sense\u2026 and with a sense of humor.\n\nIn the fall of 1996, Indiana University was a rarity among colleges \u2013 a campus without a single a cappella group, where other schools often had multiple ensembles (Yale boasted 15!). So ten students came together to remedy the situation \u2013 hand-picked by Dan not only for their outstanding voices, but for their personalities. Standing alone, they knew they had to stand out to succeed. Purposefully avoiding the stereotype of the traditional college a cappella group, they treated themselves more like a local band that just happened to use their voices as their instruments. As Dan recalls, \u201cWe needed to be a group that would blend in terms of both sound and character.\u201d\n\nBeginning with Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cThe Longest Time,\u201d they built up enough of a repertoire to play the school\u2019s annual 36-hour non-stop Dance Marathon. As the new group, they were booked to sing at 7a.m. Sunday morning \u2013 and they stole the event. \u201cEveryone stopped what they were doing and listened to us,\u201d says Dan. \u201cAfter each song ended, they screamed and cheered\u2026 we walked off stage feeling like The Beatles after their Ed Sullivan Show debut.\u201d SNC began performing at a variety of campus events and sorority functions (\u201cWhere else could we get the attention of hundreds of women on campus?,\u201d says Dan). It wasn\u2019t long before they were headlining concerts, and within two years, they were touring nationally. They opened for artists like Lou Rawls, performed at Chicago Cubs and White Sox games, and even made their way to Carnegie Hall, where they blew away the crowd at the National Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. The original line-up of Straight No Chaser released three albums, which sold over 50,000 copies.\n\nThe key to their success was the unique approach and attitude they brought to the art of a cappella. \u201cWhen we went to Carnegie Hall and competed against the UC Berkeley Men\u2019s Octet, it was their 50th Anniversary\u2026 and we\u2019d been around for two years!,\u201d says Randy. \u201cSo we always felt like we had something to prove, because we started from nothing. We were almost like a sports team; we\u2019d huddle backstage and get ourselves pumped up before a concert. We had to win people over strictly based on our performance, because we didn\u2019t have any kind of tradition or history behind us like many of the other groups.\u201d\n\nStraight No Chaser forged a unique style based on a combination of musical brilliance balanced with a healthy dose of self-deprecating humor. \u201cWe would dip into something contemporary that you wouldn\u2019t think an a cappella group could pull off. But instead of having people say, oh that was funny, we wanted them to say, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe they did that,\u2019\u201d Randy explains. \u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019d try to make each other laugh on stage, because if we weren\u2019t having fun, how could the audience be enjoying the show? If we had a good time on stage, then the audience would have a good time as well.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, with college graduation looming, the members of Straight No Chaser chose their replacements \u2013 putting a plan in place to ensure that the new tradition they had created would continue on with successive generations of IU undergrads. Then, in April 2006, the unexpected happened \u2013 Indiana University decided to host a reunion concert for the original members. In honor of the event, Randy produced a DVD of one of their 1998 concerts, and he posted clips from it on YouTube to share with the other founding members. Suddenly, concert footage that was nearly a decade old was available to be seen by millions of people worldwide\u2026 and see it they did, in mind-blowing numbers. With no promotion, Straight No Chaser\u2019s version of \u201cThe 12 Days Of Christmas\u201d (interpolating Toto\u2019s \u201cAfrica\u201d) received more than 7 million views in December of 2007 alone, becoming the hottest viral video of the season. Randy sold out every copy of the DVD he had put together, and his supplier couldn\u2019t even produce new copies fast enough to keep up with rising demand.\n\nIn a turn of events that the spiritually inclined might describe as a \u201chigher power\u201d moment, Atlantic Records Chairman/CEO Craig Kallman happened to be among those millions of viewers. \u201cIt was completely random and totally unexpected,\u201d says Kallman. \u201cI was surfing YouTube to check out what was new, when I saw this brilliant, fresh, and totally compelling performance. And then I saw how many hits they were getting, and I had something of an epiphany. So I emailed Randy right away.\u201d Randy, not surprisingly, thought it was some kind of prank. \u201cThe head of Atlantic Records emailing me at 8a.m. New Year\u2019s Day and saying he was interested in our group? I thought, \u2018yeah, right.\u2019\u201d Fortunately, Randy decided to check it out anyway, and he and Dan soon found themselves having dinner with Craig in LA. Within a few days, the entire group flew to Atlantic\u2019s offices in New York, and a deal was in the works.\n\nIn the years since they graduated from college, the original members of Straight No Chaser had embarked on a variety of life paths \u2013 some pursuing professional careers in music and theatre, some going into other fields entirely. But suddenly presented with the unforeseen opportunity to come back together, make their major label debut, and take their music to a new level, they all agreed to seize the head-spinning moment.\n\nTaking off from the runaway success of \u201cThe 12 Days Of Christmas,\u201d Straight No Chaser makes their Atlantic debut with \u201cHOLIDAY SPIRITS,\u201d a captivating collection of Christmas songs. The goal, as Dan explains, was to deliver \u201cpowerful arrangements of the Christmas music that everyone loves. So many Christmas albums stray too far away from the original songs, and I think that can be a turn-off. Ultimately, it\u2019s the time of year when people want to hear songs they\u2019re familiar with and be able to sing along. We want our arrangements to re-energize the classics that everyone loves.\u201d At the same time, Straight No Chaser shows their musical versatility with two original compositions by Dan, \u201cIndiana Christmas\u201d and \u201cChristmas Wish.\u201d\n\nFor the recording of \u201cHOLIDAY SPIRITS,\u201d the group decided to return to where it all began \u2013 Bloomington, Indiana and Airtime Studios, run by award-winning producer/engineer Dave Weber. As Dan explains, \u201cA cappella recording, just like the music style itself, is its own niche and requires it own set of skills. It\u2019s more about the engineer and producer than it is about the studio itself. Dave has been recording a cappella music for 15 years. He knows our voices, and he knows how to capture the best sound from us. We have an amazing rapport with him.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cHOLIDAY SPIRITS\u201d coming in the fall of 2008, Straight No Chaser are looking forward to a full slate of concert performances, TV appearances, and everything that a major label release entails. But, just as importantly, they are already looking further down the road, to the recording of an album designed for year-round listening pleasure, and to the enthusiastic pursuit of a career they could never have imagined would have taken such an extraordinary path.\n\nThe birth of Straight No Chaser\u2019s second life is a story of talent, drive, and some very good luck indeed. But their goal remains the same as it was back in their college days. As Randy says, \u201cWe want the audience to not miss the instruments, be surprised by what we\u2019re doing, and in the end, appreciate the songs in a whole new way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2010 Williams St, San Leandro, CA 94577", "Artist": "And Then Came Humans", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8897159.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.178035, 37.712325], "Date": "Sun Dec 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-29", "Genre": "Genres: JazzRock, Funk, Hip-Hop, Experimental", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "21st Amendment Brewery", "moreBioInfo": "Our debut release \u201cIn Heat Wave\u201d is out now!

He's a fine player with an attractive sound (influenced a bit by Grover Washington, Jr.) who often caresses melodies, putting a lot of emotion into his solos. Because he does not improvise much (sticking mostly to predictable melody statements), his music largely falls outside of jazz. However, because he is listed at the top of \"contemporary jazz\" charts and is identified with jazz in the minds of the mass public, he is classified as jazz.\n\nKenny Gorelick started playing professionally with Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra in 1976. He recorded with Cold, Bold & Together (a Seattle-based funk group) and freelanced locally. After graduating from the University of Washington, Kenny G worked with Jeff Lorber Fusion, making two albums with the group. Soon he was signed to Arista, recording his debut as a leader in 1982. His fourth album, Duotones (which included the very popular \"Songbird\"), made him into a star. Soon he was in demand for guest appearances on recordings of such famous singers as Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, and Natalie Cole. Kenny G's own records have sold remarkably well, particularly Breathless, which has easily topped eight million copies in the U.S.; his total album sales top 30 million copies. The holiday album Miracles, released in 1994, and 1996's Moment continued the momentum of his massive commercial success. He also recorded his own version of the Celine Dion/Titanic smash \"My Heart Will Go On\" in 1998, but the following year he released Classics in the Key of G, a collection of jazz standards like \"'Round Midnight\" and \"Body and Soul,\" possibly to reclaim some jazz credibility.\n\nFaith: A Holiday Album was released that same year, followed by a limited-edition re-release of the 1997 Greatest Hits disc. In 2002 Kenny G dipped into tropical territory with Paradise, which featured guest appearances by Brian McKnight and Chant\u00e9 Moore. This was followed by a music video collection, another holiday album, entitled Wishes, and, in 2003, a second greatest-hits collection, Ultimate Kenny G. Perhaps in a bid to shake up his discography a bit, in 2004 Kenny G released At Last...The Duets Album, which featured \"duets\" with LeAnn Rimes and Chaka Khan. Two years later, smooth jazz's king of the soprano sax returned to a purely instrumental approach on the brassy, big-band-inspired albums Holiday Collection and I'm in the Mood for Love; 2006 was also the year the artist was dubbed the best golfer in music by Golf Digest, beating out Vince Gill for the number one spot. In 2008, Kenny G released the Latin-inspired Rhythm and Romance. The sax player next drifted toward R&B for 2010's Heart and Soul, which featured guest vocals from Robin Thicke and Babyface. A collection with Rahul Sharma called Namaste followed in 2012, and in 2015 Kenny G released a tribute to bossa nova titled Brazilian Nights, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. In 2017, G kept up his active concert schedule, even pairing with fellow smooth jazz legend George Benson for the limited engagement Breezin' & Breathless Tour.", "otherInfo": "Food and Full Bar Available for PurchaseJAZZ SUPERSTAR KENNY G RETURNS FOR A YEAR-END HOLIDAY RESIDENCY.Kenny will be here for multiple shows over five nights leading up to the New Years Eve celebration performance.Sit down to dinner and wine in an intimate, up close and personal evening with one of the most iconic and best-selling instrumental musicians of all time, Kenny G.With Sold Out shows across the globe, Kenny is ending 2019s year long run of international performances in the picturesque backdrop of the Napa Valley.

This rich new trove of sharp-witted songs showcases a bristling, late 70\u2019s \u2013 early 80\u2019s power pop punk aesthetic which hits as hard as it did at the band\u2019s formation 17 years ago. Eight albums (one platinum and three gold) and a barrel full of anthemic hit songs later, Cracker endures, using their ability to weave decades of influences into an album that is seamlessly riveting. In Sunrise\u2026, long-time partners David Lowery and Johnny Hickman, 12-year Cracker drummer Frank Funaro and bassist Sal Maida (since 2006), train a watchful eye on the current socio-musical landscape as they weave an eerie yet strangely soothing story of escapism, apocalypse and renewal. Friends John Doe, Patterson Hood and Adam Duritz (whose mega-band Counting Crows was once produced by Lowery) make spirited guest appearances. The recording was helmed by Athens, GA-based producer/engineer David Barbe, a longtime friend of Lowery who has manned consoles for the likes of Son Volt and the alt-Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers. The explosive title track that wraps the 11-song collection is thematic, belying its seemingly cheery title to take a tough-edged look at the precarious times we live in. Ever the observant storyteller, Lowery calls it like he sees it: the affluence and wealth America seemed to have these past decades was built on a mirage. The sun shines a harsh light on a landscape of decay. The golden age, the promised land, the land of milk and honey, never materialized. For Sunrise\u2026, Lowery and Hickman took a new approach to their creative process, joining Funaro and Maida to write most songs from scratch. (Whereas on previous albums, Lowery and Hickman would bring near-finished tracks to the rest of the band.) Cracker were self-disciplined\u2014 writing together one week every two months, between tours, for a year. The goal was to work on two songs per day\u2014and somehow, the combined force of their distinctive and mutual influences gave rise to a crackling, raw musical factory of sorts. Says Lowery, \u201cThe coolest part of making the new album was the self-imposed time structure we created, the fact that we all gathered to write these songs like it was an actual job. At one point, when we had four songs that needed lyrics, Johnny and I went to the legendary punk studio, The Blasting Room, in Ft. Collins CO, and rented the B room, where we stayed until we had the right words. It was refreshing to do it this way, to challenge ourselves to write with the clock ticking. It was like starting a band and committing to a rehearsal time. We weren\u2019t kicking back on an island in the Caribbean, waiting for the muse to hit us. We got down to work, found the punk and glam rock in our blood and woke up to Sunrise In The Land Of Milk And Honey.\u201d Considering drummer Funaro\u2019s background playing with The Dictators and Joey Ramone, and bassist Maida\u2019s background with Roxy Music and Sparks, it was inevitable that the new album would acquire its own unique edge. \u201cIt was a little different involving Frank and Sal\u2019s musical tastes and their background from the get-go,\u201d says Lowery, \u201cbut this led us to realize the common element we all share. We all came of age playing power pop-punk and that early new wave stuff. Once we got on this path, it started surfacing in so many songs that it became a thematic element for the whole project. We all started playing music in that era so we weren\u2019t surprised when those sounds started rising up. Sunrise\u2026isn\u2019t the \u2018Cracker punk record\u2019 but it\u2019s definitely got that time stamp, the \u201978-\u201983 flavors, all over it. The other thing we did differently was actually playing all the songs in concert before ever committing them to digital. Most bands do the album first, then take the tunes on the road.\u201d \u201cIn a lot of ways, the methodology behind this album brought us all back to when we all started our early bands, when the opportunity to write and record albums came after playing tons of live shows,\u201d adds the Richmond, VA-based singer. \u201cI think one of the reasons Cracker has survived this long when so many of the bands that started in the early 90s faded is that we\u2019ve always made the record we want to hear right now. We\u2019ve always had the belief and confidence that others will feel like we do. Eclecticism was the norm for bands in the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s and into the 80\u2019s, and that freedom leads to great bursts of creativity and the potential to make classic albums that stand the test of time.\u201d The first album track explodes with a slicing guitar riff from Hickman. \u201cYalla Yalla\u201d is a colorful rumination on an Arabic phrase meaning, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Lowery heard U.S. soldiers greeting each other this way at the Atlanta airport. \u201cLike rock musicians, soldiers in every era have their own language of bravado and machismo,\u201d he says. The band dives deep into the punk on the frenetic \u201cShow Me How This Thing Works,\u201d a song inspired by Lowery helping a friend with a quantitative finance problem; the singer is proud that he was once a budding mathematician. \u201cTurn On Tune In Drop Out With Me\u201d is a lilting pop/rock reminder that in these precarious times, many may feel like returning to the bold escapism of the 60s, of the hippies who left the rat race behind to \u201cdrop out\u201d into spiritual refuge. The blistering \u201cHand Me My Inhaler\u201d finds its hapless protagonist blustering at an ex-girlfriend's door, \u201cgonna reform the band without you.\" Hickman says of the blues-funk \u201cI Could Be Wrong, I Could Be Right,\u201d \u201cWhen I hand David a melody like this one, I have no idea where he\u2019s going to take it, and I love that. Suddenly the devil and members of the Lewis and Clark expedition were caught up together in some sort of a psychedelic love conspiracy.\u201d \u201cTime Machine,\u201d a black-booted, Celtic-riffed, early-punk kick to the jaw of any pretenders, was inspired by a conversation Hickman had with Black Flag and Descendants drummer Bill Stevenson (who co-founded The Blasting Room studios). Hickman and Stevenson both realized that they had been caught up in the same early 80s punk rock riot at a legendary Dead Kennedys show. It\u2019s a message to today's punks that they perhaps couldn\u2019t have survived what the previous generation endured. \u201cI took a couple of billy club hits that night,\u201d Hickman says, \u201cI got off easy.\u201d Punk-and-now-Americana legend John Doe harmonizes on the throbbing, surf guitar driven, \u201cWe All Shine a Light.\u201d This swarming, Buzzcocks-like rocker is a comment on multicuturalism and tolerance, by way of an ode to Pakistan\u2019s cricket team, the Peshawar Panthers. Patterson Hood of the Drive-By Truckers duets with Lowery on the swampy, folk-Americana of \u201cFriends,\u201d a drunken tale of dysfunctional but loving friendship. One of the album\u2019s more poignant moments arrives when Adam Duritz guests, singing alongside Lowery on the romantically selfless \u201cDarling One.\u201d The stomping, harmonica-laden \u201cHey Brett, You Know What Time It Is\u201d came from a sardonic line uttered to Lowery by Built To Spill\u2019s Brett Netson, during an exchange of ever-escalating shockeries. Lowery recalls, \u201cHe walked into our dressing room and joked, \u2018Will we know when it's time to start dragging rich people from their cars and killin' em'?\u2019 For Frank and me, it grew into a text message exchange and later a song.\u201d A brief rundown of Cracker\u2019s history: Lowery, in the mid-80s, in Santa Cruz, California, formed Camper Van Beethoven, and their \u201cTake the Skinheads Bowling\u201d became an instant college radio staple. When CVB disbanded on tour in Sweden, following their second major label release, Lowery formed Cracker with his longtime friend Johnny Hickman. (The pair had met on the local music scene as teenagers in Redlands, CA.) Cracker\u2019s emergent sound had less in common with Camper\u2019s exotic excursions and was more in synch with the Kinks and Southern roots music. They released their self-titled debut on Virgin, and following the #1 Modern Rock hit \u201cTeen Angst (What The World Needs Now),\u201d the band became a minor commercial sensation (complete with then-significant MTV exposure). The platinum-selling Kerosene Hat contained the enormous, era-defining hit single \u201cLow,\u201d as well as \u201cGet Off This,\u201d and \u201cEurotrash Girl.\u201d When the dust settled, Cracker found themselves with an ever-growing, devoted following both in the U.S. (where fans refer to themselves as Crumbs) and throughout Europe. Today the band stays well connected to yet another generation of fans via internet, many of whom were kids when these alt-rock godfathers were first ruling rock radio.

But hey, it\u2019s not all bad: Portugal. The Man has a new album coming out called Woodstock.\n\nPTM\u2019s last album came out over three years ago\u2014a long gap for a band who\u2019ve dropped roughly an album a year since 2006. And in true, prolific band fashion, they\u2019ve spent almost every minute since 2013 working on an album called Gloomin + Doomin. They created a shit-ton of individual songs, but as a whole, none of them hung together in a way that felt right. Then John Gourley, PTM\u2019s lead singer, made a trip home to Wasilla, Alaska, (Home of Portugal. The Man\u2019s biggest fan, Sarah Palin) and two things happened that completely changed the album\u2019s trajectory.\n\nFirst, John got some parental tough love from his old man, who called John on the proverbial carpet or dogsled or whatever you put people on when you want to yell at them in Alaska. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long to finish the album?\u201d John\u2019s dad said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what bands do? Write songs and then put them out?\u201d Like fathers and unlicensed therapists tend to do, John\u2019s dad cut him deep. The whole thing started John thinking about why the band seemed to be stuck on a musical elliptical machine from hell and, more importantly, about how to get off of it.\n\nSecond, fate stuck its wiener in John\u2019s ear again when he found his dad\u2019s ticket stub from the original 1969 Woodstock music festival. It seems like a small thing, but talking to his dad about Woodstock \u201969 knocked something loose in John\u2019s head. He realized that, in the same tradition of bands from that era, Portugal. The Man needed to speak out about the world crumbling around them. With these two ideas converging, the band made a seemingly bat-shit-crazy decision: they took all of the work they had done for the three years prior and they threw it out.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy and there was the constant threat that the band's record label might have them killed, but the totally insane decision paid off. With new, full-on, musical boners, the band went back to the studio\u2014working with John Hill (In The Mountain In The Cloud), Danger Mouse (Evil Friends), Mike D (Everything Cool), and longtime collaborator Casey Bates (The one consistent producer since the first record). In this new-found creative territory, the album that became Woodstock rolled out naturally from there\n\nRemember that mountain of burning needles we were talking about? Good. Because Woodstock is an album (Including the new single \u201cFeel It Still\u201d) that\u2014with optimism and heart\u2014points at the giant pile and says, \u201cHey, this pile is fucked up!\u201d And if you think that pile is fucked up too, you owe it to yourself\u2014hell, to all of us\u2014to get out there and do something about it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Wright Dr, Loma Mar, CA 94021", "Artist": "Ryan Herr Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8243946.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.282318, 37.268242], "Date": "Mon Dec 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-30", "Genre": "Genres: World, Reggae, International, Chill, Groove~, Live, Dub", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Redwood Glen", "moreBioInfo": "Ryan Herr has been weaving his mix of live and electronic music for festivals, events, ecstatic dances, and retreats throughout the world for nearly 20 years.

Fuck pandering. Fuck fakeness. Fuck fear.\u201d Fantastic Negrito is the incarnation of a musician who is reborn after going through a lot of awful shit. In fact, the name Fantastic Negrito represents his third rebirth, literally coming back from death this time. The narrative on this man is as important as the sound, because the narrative is the sound. Songs born from a long hard life channeled through black roots music. Slide guitar, drums, piano. Urgent, desperate, edgy. Fantastic Negrito is the story of a man who struggled to \u201cmake it\u201d, who \u201cgot it\u201d, and who lost it all. For anyone who ever felt like it was over yet hoped it wasn\u2019t, this is your music; blues harnessed, forged in realness. For anyone who ever considered getting their old high-school band back together, this is your inspiration. These are singular songs by a true musician who writes and produces. They are his fuel as he embarks on the third comeback of his life.\n\nThe first life (\u2018who am I and where am I going?\u2019). Fantastic Negrito was raised in an orthodox Muslim household. His father was a Somali-Caribbean immigrant who mostly played traditional African music. When, at the age of 12, Negrito\u2019s family moved from Massachusetts to Oakland, he was hit with an intense culture shock. Oakland in 1970s was a million miles from Negrito\u2019s conservative childhood. He went from Arab chants to Funkadelic in one day, living in the heart of one of the wildest, most infamous, most vibrant black communities in the nation. Shit was extra real in Oakland.\n\nBy the time he was 20, Negrito had taught himself to play every instrument he could get his hands on. He was recording music, but he was also caught up in street shit. This went on for several years until a near death encounter with masked gunmen. After that Negrito packed his bags and headed to LA, armed with a demo on cassette.\n\nThe second life (\u2018I want to be a star\u2026I think\u2019). It didn\u2019t take long for Negrito to find himself entrenched in the \u2018Hollywood\u2019 lifestyle; \u201cclubs and bitches and bullshit politics that have nothing to do with great music.\u201d Negrito signed with a big time manager and soon after that, a million dollar deal at Interscope \u2026and soon after that, creative death.\n\nThe record deal was a disaster. Gangsta rap was ruling the airwaves and Negrito was in the wrong place at the wrong era. Negrito came out of the deal with a failed album and his confidence gutted. He was infected by the constant emphasis on \u2018what would sell\u2019; which looks, hooks and gimmicks would attract an audience. He lost all sense of himself. The songs stopped coming to him, so he quit. He sold all of his shit and he quit.\n\nIn 2000, Negrito was in a near fatal car accident that put him in a coma. For four weeks it was touch and go. Because his muscles atrophied while bedridden, he had to go through months of frustrating physical therapy to regain use of his legs. Rods were placed throughout his body. And worst of all, his playing hand was mutilated. Though he rehabbed intensely for several years, the damage was permanent. In 2008, he returned home to Oakland.\n\nThe third life (the birth of Negrito). Back in Oakland, Negrito forgot about life as a musician. He got married, he planted vegetables, raised his own chickens, and made money growing weed. He also settled into being a man, on his own, clear of the distractions of wanting to be a star. This is when his specific POV of the world came into focus. His conservative Muslim values melded with the liberal, multi-cultural world of Oakland. The cynicism that comes from struggle made room for the hope that comes from cheating death. He truly knew who he was. He was confident about his place in the world because he understood it as much as any man can. And then his son Kyu was born.\n\nWith Kyu\u2019s entrance into the world, all the creative energy Negrito bottled for years came rushing. His musical choices were sharp and without doubt. He began recording without the hindrances that come with chasing trends. \u201cFuck what\u2019s hot now, what moves me?\u201d Negrito turned to the original DNA of all American music, the Blues. The beating life had given him primed him to channel his literal and musical forefathers: the Blues musicians of the Delta.\n\nFor Fantastic Negrito, \u201cderivative\u201d is the devil so to ensure his sound is his own, every chord comes from a place of immediacy. Immediacy opens the door for instinct. Instinct is God\u2019s tool that makes an artist into an individual. Negrito leaves the original sounds of Lead Belly and Skip Woods intact and builds bridges to modernity by looping and sampling his own live instruments.\n\nWhen you listen to Negrito, you\u2019re invited to hear the story of life after destruction. Your dream can die. You probably will give up. But from there, you can start everything over.\n\nFantastic Negrito EP out now\nhttp://blackballuniverse.bandcamp.com/album/fantasic-negrito-ep\nhttp://open.spotify.com/album/205ozCsqCFqgqFuT6zXzw6\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fantastic-negrito-ep/id968215538", "otherInfo": "Fantastic Negrito - 2 Night NYE Residency at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Brian Culbertson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9631363.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Mon Dec 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-30", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Smooth Jazz, Funk, R&B, soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "Incredibly, it\u2019s been 25 years since Brian Culbertson burst onto the scene when, as a music major studying trombone, he recorded an album in his college apartment featuring his keyboard-led contemporary jazz, funk and R&B tracks that landed him a lengthy record deal and signaled that a star was born.

He's a fine player with an attractive sound (influenced a bit by Grover Washington, Jr.) who often caresses melodies, putting a lot of emotion into his solos. Because he does not improvise much (sticking mostly to predictable melody statements), his music largely falls outside of jazz. However, because he is listed at the top of \"contemporary jazz\" charts and is identified with jazz in the minds of the mass public, he is classified as jazz.\n\nKenny Gorelick started playing professionally with Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra in 1976. He recorded with Cold, Bold & Together (a Seattle-based funk group) and freelanced locally. After graduating from the University of Washington, Kenny G worked with Jeff Lorber Fusion, making two albums with the group. Soon he was signed to Arista, recording his debut as a leader in 1982. His fourth album, Duotones (which included the very popular \"Songbird\"), made him into a star. Soon he was in demand for guest appearances on recordings of such famous singers as Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, and Natalie Cole. Kenny G's own records have sold remarkably well, particularly Breathless, which has easily topped eight million copies in the U.S.; his total album sales top 30 million copies. The holiday album Miracles, released in 1994, and 1996's Moment continued the momentum of his massive commercial success. He also recorded his own version of the Celine Dion/Titanic smash \"My Heart Will Go On\" in 1998, but the following year he released Classics in the Key of G, a collection of jazz standards like \"'Round Midnight\" and \"Body and Soul,\" possibly to reclaim some jazz credibility.\n\nFaith: A Holiday Album was released that same year, followed by a limited-edition re-release of the 1997 Greatest Hits disc. In 2002 Kenny G dipped into tropical territory with Paradise, which featured guest appearances by Brian McKnight and Chant\u00e9 Moore. This was followed by a music video collection, another holiday album, entitled Wishes, and, in 2003, a second greatest-hits collection, Ultimate Kenny G. Perhaps in a bid to shake up his discography a bit, in 2004 Kenny G released At Last...The Duets Album, which featured \"duets\" with LeAnn Rimes and Chaka Khan. Two years later, smooth jazz's king of the soprano sax returned to a purely instrumental approach on the brassy, big-band-inspired albums Holiday Collection and I'm in the Mood for Love; 2006 was also the year the artist was dubbed the best golfer in music by Golf Digest, beating out Vince Gill for the number one spot. In 2008, Kenny G released the Latin-inspired Rhythm and Romance. The sax player next drifted toward R&B for 2010's Heart and Soul, which featured guest vocals from Robin Thicke and Babyface. A collection with Rahul Sharma called Namaste followed in 2012, and in 2015 Kenny G released a tribute to bossa nova titled Brazilian Nights, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. In 2017, G kept up his active concert schedule, even pairing with fellow smooth jazz legend George Benson for the limited engagement Breezin' & Breathless Tour.", "otherInfo": "Food and Full Bar Available for PurchaseJAZZ SUPERSTAR KENNY G RETURNS FOR A YEAR-END HOLIDAY RESIDENCY.Enjoy a festive evening with Kenny G!Sit down to food and wine in an intimate, up close and personal experience with one of the most iconic and best-selling instrumental musicians of all time, Kenny G.

A steady diet of projects as solo artist, producer, composer, and fittingly, chef, has taught him that the connections between seemingly separate disciplines can be a source of inspiration rather than distraction. Perhaps it stems from his synesthesia, a rare neurological condition where the brain perceives a relationship between unrelated senses. Wong sees sounds and hears colors. What a doctor would deem peculiar, his collaborators appreciate as a gift: this multi-sensory approach allows Wong to create visual soundscapes enhanced by his unique perception of the world around him.\n\n\"It's all creative expression\u2014just in different dialects,\" Nashville-based Wong explains. He has an uncanny ability to communicate through varied genres and mediums, whether painting vivid worlds through his own songwriting, cultivating other artists\u2019 ideas as a producer, or creating recipes for his pop-up restaurant, Angelhouse Family Dinner. His story has always been one of nonlinear paths, of redefining boundaries. From his time in major-label band The Din Pedals (Epic), to duo projects The Animators and The Paper Raincoat, to exploring his own voice as a solo artist, Wong has constantly pushed himself to find new flavors to satisfy his creative hunger.\n\nWong's commitment to indulging his curiosity has resulted in Latin GRAMMY-nominated production work (Miguel Bose), placements in film and television (Lincoln Lawyer, The Last Song), major ad campaigns (Google, Aquafina), and album production projects with Delta Rae (Big Machine), Vienna Teng (Universal), and Ari Hest (Columbia), among others. It\u2019s allowed him to criss-cross the globe, performing live at festivals like Coachella and Outside Lands, arenas in Mexico City and theaters in Europe and Japan.\n\nAnd now it has led him to his current chapter, revealing his singular voice and vision as a solo artist. His first solo effort, A City On A Lake, contains darkly gorgeous, cinematic folk and vivid lyricism, undergirded by organic and electronic textures. No Depression called it \u201chaunting and enticing,\u201d and the album caught the attention of NPR who invited him to perform the songs on their Mountain Stage radio show.\n\n2017 will see the release of Wong's second full-length solo album, a long-form musical theater piece titled The Paper Raincoat, and a duo EP with Jesse Terry inspired by the stories of climate change refugees, as well as several high-profile collaborations between his pop-up series and popular Nashville restaurants.

Most recently, Spafford has been selected to play high-profile events like Bonnaroo, The Peach Music Festival, Summer Camp, Firefly Music Festival, and Suwanee Hulaween. \"We Jam\" instagram.com/spaffordmusic https://twitter.com/spaffordmusic", "otherInfo": "Spafford"}, {"Address": "99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Justin Martin", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7376952.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.417316, 37.778083], "Date": "Mon Dec 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-30", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Hyphy, House, Techno", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "i started playing the pots and pans when i was 2... and now im a dj.

The founding members were schoolmates David Hinds (the primary songwriter as well as the lead singer and guitarist), Basil Gabbidon (guitar), and Ronnie \"Stepper\" McQueen (bass). All of them came from working class West Indian immigrant families, and none had much musical experience. They took some time to improve their technical proficiency, often on Roots inspired material by the Wailers, Burning Spear and several other prominent Jamaican artists. McQueen suggested the group name, after a racehorse, and they soon fleshed out the lineup with drummer Steve \"Grizzly\" Nisbett, keyboardist/vocalist Selwyn \"Bumbo\" Brown, percussionist/vocalist Alphonso \"Fonso\" Martin, and vocalist Michael Riley.\n\nSteel Pulse initially had difficulty finding live gigs, as club owners were reluctant to give them a platform for their \"subversive\" Rastafarian politics. Luckily, the punk movement was opening up new avenues for music all over Britain, and also finding a spiritual kinship with protest reggae. Thus, the group wound up as an opening act for punk and new wave bands like the Clash, the Stranglers, Generation X, the Police, and XTC, and built a broad-based audience in the process. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Steel Pulse developed a theatrical stage show that leavened their social commentary with satirical humor; many of the members dressed in costumes that mocked traditional British archetypes (Riley was a vicar, McQueen a bowler-wearing aristocrat, Martin a coach footman, etc.). The band issued two singles -- \"Kibudu, Mansetta and Abuku\" and \"Nyah Love\" -- on small independent labels, when they then came to the attention of Island Records after opening for Burning Spear.\n\nSteel Pulse's first single for Island was the classic \"Ku Klux Klan,\" which happened to lend itself well to the band's highly visual, costume-heavy concerts. It appeared on their 1978 debut album, Handsworth Revolution, which was soon hailed as a classic of British reggae by many fans and critics, thanks to songs like the title track, \"Macka Splaff,\" \"Prodigal Son,\" and \"Soldiers.\" Riley departed before the follow-up, 1979's Tribute to the Martyrs, which featured other key early singles in \"Sound System\" and \"Babylon Makes the Rules,\" and solidified the band's reputation for uncompromising political ferocity. That reputation went out the window on 1980's Caught You, a more pop-oriented set devoted to dance tracks and lovers rock. By that point, Steel Pulse was keen on trying to crack the American market, and went on tour over Island's objections. Caught You was issued in the States as Reggae Fever, but failed to break the group, and they soon parted ways with Island.\n\nSteel Pulse moved on to Elektra/Asylum, which released an LP version of their headlining set at the 1981 Reggae Sunsplash Festival. Their studio debut was 1982's True Democracy, a generally acclaimed set that balanced bright, accessible production with a return to social consciousness. It became their first charting LP in America, making both the pop and R&B listings. The slicker follow-up, Earth Crisis, was released in 1984 and featured producer Jimmy \"Senyah\" Haynes subbing on guitar and bass for founding members Gabbidon and McQueen, both of whom left the group by the end of the recording sessions. They were replaced by guitarist Carlton Bryan and bassist Alvin Ewen for 1986's Babylon the Bandit, another Haynes-produced effort that ranked as the group's most polished, synth-centered record to date. It featured the powerful \"Not King James Version\" and won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album.\n\nIn 1988, Steel Pulse released State of Emergency, their most explicitly crossover-oriented album yet. They also contributed the track \"Can't Stand It\" to the soundtrack of Spike Lee's classic Do the Right Thing. In 1991, they released another heavily commercial album, the Grammy-nominated Victims, which featured the single \"Taxi Driver.\" Backing up the song's views, Steel Pulse filed a class-action lawsuit against the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging that drivers discriminated against blacks and particularly Rastafarians. Founding member Fonso Martin left that year, reducing Steel Pulse to a core trio of Hinds, Nisbett, and Brown. Their backing band still featured Ewen and was elsewhere anchored by guitarist Clifford \"Moonie\" Pusey, keyboardist Sidney Mills, trumpeter Kevin Batchelor, Saxophonist Jerry Johnson and Trombonist Clark Gayton.\n\nThe 1992 live album Rastafari Centennial marked the beginning of a return to the group's musical roots, and earned another Grammy nomination. The following year, they performed at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration, the first reggae band to appear at such an event. 1994's studio album Vex completed Steel Pulse's re-embrace of classic roots reggae, though it also nodded to contemporary dancehall with several guest toasters and a digital-flavored production. 1997's Rage and Fury continued in a similar vein, and was nominated for a Grammy. In 1999, the group released another collection of live performances, Living Legacy.\n\nFast forward a long seven years since their previous album, Rage and Fury, Steel Pulse would return yet again, this time with African Holocaust, and yet again have their ranks dwindled. Core members David Hinds (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Selwyn Brown (keyboards, backing vocals) are the only ones to remain from the band's original line-up, but they more than hold their own and they're joined by a deep roster of supporting musicians, a list too long to list. As always, the music is what's most important, and on that count, this Steel Pulse lineup indeed makes the mark. Granted, it did take them seven years to get the album out, but still it won a Grammy Awards Nomination for Best Reggae Album of the year. There's really not too much else to say about African Holocaust. Longtime fans will know what to expect. Newcomers should know a few things: above all, Steel Pulse are known for performing well-written, Afrocentric songs that are rebellious without being negative or inflammatory, and though the band membership has changed over the years, the type of songs hasn't, nor has the steady move away from dancehall that was apparent on the band's previous album. the message and music remain true to the band's principles and vision.\n\nSteel Pulse is one of Britain's greatest reggae bands, in terms of creative and commercial success. Steel Pulse started out playing authentic roots reggae with touches of jazz and Latin music, and earned a substantial audience worldwide. Their 1978 debut, Handsworth Revolution, is still regarded by many critics as a landmark and a high point of British reggae. By the late '80s, Steel Pulse had won a Grammy and were working full-fledged crossover territory. They subsequently returned to a tough-minded, rootsy sound and have added touches of dancehall and hip-hop along the way.", "otherInfo": "Steel Pulse at The UC Theatre on Monday, December 30, 2019"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Native Elements", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6273896.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Mon Dec 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-30", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Reggae, Lovers Rock, Roots, Island Soul", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "San Francisco powerhouse, Native Elements has been keeping the energetic, feel-good reggae tradition alive in the Bay Area for over 18 years.

It is good-time dance music that draws from a diversity of American popular genres, and incorporates elements of gospel, reggae and other world music. Lengthy, improvisational flights through a wide range of musical styles provide the inspiration for high-spirited crowds whose kinetic dance floor energy serves as a vibrant counterpart to the musical journey transpiring on stage.\n\nThe strength of the group is reflected in the scope of their original material. From jazzy, ethereal, instrumental excursions to intelligent, lyrically honest songs, the music of Shady Groove ranges from reflective introspection to full-throttle, rocking abandon. They have developed a talent for crafting unique and distinguished original works, rooted in traditional influences, yet significantly evolved to express the unique insight and intuitive musical chemistry that are the substance of the band\u2019s creativity. Whether singing their own material or digging into one of the classic covers they interpret, (the band covers works from Ritchie Havens, the Jerry Garcia Band, Jimmy Cliff, and a host of Motown, blues, and other artists), vocalist and guitarist Jerry Brown delivers the material with the honest feel of someone who has lived a life of music for over twenty years. Lead guitarist Matt Hartle creates hypnotic, astonishingly lyrical and fluid lines that render audiences spellbound. The animated rhythmic and melodic interplay of the guitarists sets the stage for the brand of fiery, spirited jamming that is the heart of Shady Groove\u2019s live performances. Dave Faulkner infuses the mix with growling Hammond organ and soulful keyboard textures, establishing the dynamic tension that fuels their musical voyage. The magic, of course, is in the GROOVE. Bret Bailey\u2019s big, propulsive dance beats and driving percussive exploits are fused with the thick, roving bass grooves of Jimmy Hubbard, to form the deep pockets and funky foundation for the improvisational journey that has earned the band its reputation as one of the Bay Area\u2019s finest jam ensembles.\n\nOver the past three years, the band has cemented its status as a leading light in the improvisational rock scene of the Bay Area and beyond, consistently providing energetic musical sets, whether opening for nationally touring acts or hosting their own full-blown jam sessions that can last all night. They have been joined onstage for their lengthy sets by such noted musicians as Vince Welnick of the Grateful Dead, Melvin Seals of the Jerry Garcia Band, Frank Zappa alumnus Ike Willis, Barry Sless of the David Nelson Band, String Cheese Incident cohort Keller Williams, DJ Logic, and blues diva Sista Monica to name a few. They have played to capacity crowds around the Bay Area at venues such as Santa Cruz\u2019s Catalyst and Rio Theater, as well as the Avalon Ballroom, Boom Boom Room, and Studio Z-TV in San Francisco. The summer of 2003 saw the band performing widely acclaimed showcase sets at the High Sierra Music Festival and they have enjoyed great success headlining their own series of late-night happenings in the emerging after-hours San Francisco music scene. The band\u2019s grass roots approach to the music and their willingness to lend their sounds to almost any situation have helped to hone their unique musical rapport and establish a reputation for providing consistently high musical moments that keep their fans coming back for more.

But hey, it\u2019s not all bad: Portugal. The Man has a new album coming out called Woodstock.\n\nPTM\u2019s last album came out over three years ago\u2014a long gap for a band who\u2019ve dropped roughly an album a year since 2006. And in true, prolific band fashion, they\u2019ve spent almost every minute since 2013 working on an album called Gloomin + Doomin. They created a shit-ton of individual songs, but as a whole, none of them hung together in a way that felt right. Then John Gourley, PTM\u2019s lead singer, made a trip home to Wasilla, Alaska, (Home of Portugal. The Man\u2019s biggest fan, Sarah Palin) and two things happened that completely changed the album\u2019s trajectory.\n\nFirst, John got some parental tough love from his old man, who called John on the proverbial carpet or dogsled or whatever you put people on when you want to yell at them in Alaska. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long to finish the album?\u201d John\u2019s dad said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what bands do? Write songs and then put them out?\u201d Like fathers and unlicensed therapists tend to do, John\u2019s dad cut him deep. The whole thing started John thinking about why the band seemed to be stuck on a musical elliptical machine from hell and, more importantly, about how to get off of it.\n\nSecond, fate stuck its wiener in John\u2019s ear again when he found his dad\u2019s ticket stub from the original 1969 Woodstock music festival. It seems like a small thing, but talking to his dad about Woodstock \u201969 knocked something loose in John\u2019s head. He realized that, in the same tradition of bands from that era, Portugal. The Man needed to speak out about the world crumbling around them. With these two ideas converging, the band made a seemingly bat-shit-crazy decision: they took all of the work they had done for the three years prior and they threw it out.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy and there was the constant threat that the band's record label might have them killed, but the totally insane decision paid off. With new, full-on, musical boners, the band went back to the studio\u2014working with John Hill (In The Mountain In The Cloud), Danger Mouse (Evil Friends), Mike D (Everything Cool), and longtime collaborator Casey Bates (The one consistent producer since the first record). In this new-found creative territory, the album that became Woodstock rolled out naturally from there\n\nRemember that mountain of burning needles we were talking about? Good. Because Woodstock is an album (Including the new single \u201cFeel It Still\u201d) that\u2014with optimism and heart\u2014points at the giant pile and says, \u201cHey, this pile is fucked up!\u201d And if you think that pile is fucked up too, you owe it to yourself\u2014hell, to all of us\u2014to get out there and do something about it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1015 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Qrion", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9144107.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.405681, 37.778048], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, House, Deep House", "Time": "3:00 AM", "Venue": "1015 Folsom", "moreBioInfo": "Taking inspiration from all the environments at her whim, Qrion uses the noise of the world around her to create intimate songs anchored by energetic beats and lush synth textures.

As his DJ career flourished and house music grew in popularity, Franky's passion drove him to production where he made his first track in 1996 and he has been hooked ever since. Franky has produced music for OM Records, Transport Records, Look At You, Chez Music and Purple Music. \"As a DJ I always had ideas of how I would like to hear the music I was playing. House is not only a style of music it enhances music of all kinds. I love jazz, gospel, disco, funk, Motown, Latin and Brazillian beats and being a producer allows me to work with all of them.\" In addition to his many productions Franky still loves being a DJ and after packing clubs across Europe and the U.S. began a residency at his own club, Pink. \"Pink came about because my partner and I wanted to create an environment that is conducive to the beauty of house music. Sexy, beautiful, international and pure Pink represents everything and everyone. There isn't a dress code but there is a vibe code, for if you can create this vibe, you can have it all, all of the elements that make the music what it is.\" The opening of Pink in San Francisco was the beginning of Franky\u2019s career as a club owner. Franky wanted to create an environment that brought all lovers of house music together under one roof with the love and compassion that the music he plays possesses. Franky created a state of the art DJ booth that made admirers of well respected DJs from all over the world. Franky\u2019s musical creativity was expressed in unimaginable ways such as bringing the entire Glide Memorial Church Choir to sing at Pink. After four years of building a life long dream Franky decided to move on to other ventures leaving behind a legendary mark on San Francisco nightlife. Franky has continued his residencies with WET LA, Winter Music Conference, Coachella and annual tours in Europe and Mexico. Through his travels Franky has found inspiration to create new sounds and promote new parties like Scuba. Scuba started out as a Naked Music party with resident DJs Miguel Migs, Mauricio Aviles and other world renowned DJs. Scuba was created by bringing together technical and complex beats with the natural beauty of instrumentals. This ensemble found a home with the well-respected label and thus took on a life of it\u2019s own as a weekly party. Franky\u2019s music can be described as octophonic, a blend of funky beats with a deepness to it. The music has a beautiful melody and most importantly a sexy sound that touches and speaks to the soul. Franky\u2019s vision has always been to blend all genres and eras of music into a musical voyage to dance and get down to. From salsa, disco, soul, gospel and sometimes rock to jazz, and French hip hop from the 90\u2019s. Franky\u2019s goal is to engage people into the music with familiarity of the rhythm like a memory waiting to be released. \u201cI believe (in fact I know) that the deeper you go the higher you get. Once you connect with this sound it will definitely speak to you. I feel it\u2019s a San Francisco sound that reflects in our everyday life here in this amazing city, but also the vibe of all San Francisco residents and especially local music lovers. House music is translated through our love for each other, through the human interest in all of us from different places on this planet. We all have this \"special vibe\" in common and house music brings it out of us.\u201d A special thank you to friends, artist and labels that have been a part of Franky Boissy\u2019s musical journey: Miguel Migs, Julius Papp, Louie Vega, Derrick Carter, Dimitri From Paris, Jask, Osanlade, Soulfuric, Kenny Dope, Jazzanova, Ben Watt, DJ Afro (Los Amigos Invisible), Mr V, Crazy Pennis, David Harness, Naked Music, Lisa Shaw, Michael Watford, Roland Clark, Jay J, Chris Lum, Marques Wyatt, Chez Music, Rocco, Giant Step, Mark Farina, Bob Sinclar, Luis Radio, Michell Week, Purple Music, OM Records, Lazy Dog, and countless others\u2026 \u00a9 2010 Franky Boissy Thanks for following my music page!

He's a fine player with an attractive sound (influenced a bit by Grover Washington, Jr.) who often caresses melodies, putting a lot of emotion into his solos. Because he does not improvise much (sticking mostly to predictable melody statements), his music largely falls outside of jazz. However, because he is listed at the top of \"contemporary jazz\" charts and is identified with jazz in the minds of the mass public, he is classified as jazz.\n\nKenny Gorelick started playing professionally with Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra in 1976. He recorded with Cold, Bold & Together (a Seattle-based funk group) and freelanced locally. After graduating from the University of Washington, Kenny G worked with Jeff Lorber Fusion, making two albums with the group. Soon he was signed to Arista, recording his debut as a leader in 1982. His fourth album, Duotones (which included the very popular \"Songbird\"), made him into a star. Soon he was in demand for guest appearances on recordings of such famous singers as Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, and Natalie Cole. Kenny G's own records have sold remarkably well, particularly Breathless, which has easily topped eight million copies in the U.S.; his total album sales top 30 million copies. The holiday album Miracles, released in 1994, and 1996's Moment continued the momentum of his massive commercial success. He also recorded his own version of the Celine Dion/Titanic smash \"My Heart Will Go On\" in 1998, but the following year he released Classics in the Key of G, a collection of jazz standards like \"'Round Midnight\" and \"Body and Soul,\" possibly to reclaim some jazz credibility.\n\nFaith: A Holiday Album was released that same year, followed by a limited-edition re-release of the 1997 Greatest Hits disc. In 2002 Kenny G dipped into tropical territory with Paradise, which featured guest appearances by Brian McKnight and Chant\u00e9 Moore. This was followed by a music video collection, another holiday album, entitled Wishes, and, in 2003, a second greatest-hits collection, Ultimate Kenny G. Perhaps in a bid to shake up his discography a bit, in 2004 Kenny G released At Last...The Duets Album, which featured \"duets\" with LeAnn Rimes and Chaka Khan. Two years later, smooth jazz's king of the soprano sax returned to a purely instrumental approach on the brassy, big-band-inspired albums Holiday Collection and I'm in the Mood for Love; 2006 was also the year the artist was dubbed the best golfer in music by Golf Digest, beating out Vince Gill for the number one spot. In 2008, Kenny G released the Latin-inspired Rhythm and Romance. The sax player next drifted toward R&B for 2010's Heart and Soul, which featured guest vocals from Robin Thicke and Babyface. A collection with Rahul Sharma called Namaste followed in 2012, and in 2015 Kenny G released a tribute to bossa nova titled Brazilian Nights, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. In 2017, G kept up his active concert schedule, even pairing with fellow smooth jazz legend George Benson for the limited engagement Breezin' & Breathless Tour.", "otherInfo": "Food and Full Bar Available for PurchaseJAZZ SUPERSTAR KENNY G RETURNS FOR A YEAR-END HOLIDAY RESIDENCY.RING IN THE NEW YEAR COUNTDOWN TO 2020 Bid farewell to 2019 with a Champagne toast as Kenny G takes us into the New Year!

He has wandered amid the expansive and diverse landscape of American music, developing an artistic sensibility that borrows from numerous sources: jazz, musical theater, cabaret, soul, folk, traditional and contemporary pop. Day uses intuition and improvisation as his primary tools to craft a sound that is familiar, yet fresh and innovative at the same time.\n\nDay\u2019s Vagabond album peaked at #11 on the Billboard Album Charts and stayed on the chart for 47 weeks. The lead single, \u201cTil You Come To Me,\u201d peaked at #3 on the chart. His recent album, Daybreak, debuted at #1 on the Itunes Jazz Charts.

Lenny\u2019s skills as a vocalist were first nurtured by singing in gospel choirs and groups around the Bay Area, where he was in good company, working alongside up-and-coming artist Sly Stone, Andre Crouch, Billy Preston and members of the Hawkins family--Edwin, Walter and Tramaine. After winning several local talent contests, Williams signed his first record deal with Fantasy Records. He cut two singles for the label, including \u201cLisa\u2019s Gone,\u201d now regarded as an R & B classic among British soul music lovers, and \u201cFeelin Blue,\u201d written by John Fogerty of Credence Clearwater Revival.

It\u2019s with that spirit that they debut \u201cHeart Shaped Box,\u201d the first new music from the band since 2017, and the first single off their upcoming full-length, Explorer.\n\nThe song began as a fun cover the band put together on a whim, on a rare day off on tour, according to bassist Jonathan Kirchner. But the track soon took on a life of its own\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find time to write on the road, and we were fighting a bit of a lull creatively,\u201d says Kirchner. \u201cI figured arranging a cover would be a fun exercise and a nice reminder that, yes, we are good at this \u2014 we just needed to get out of our own way.\u201d\n\nChoosing a Nirvana song was a no-brainer, says singer Ziek McCarter.

Influenced by the sounds and songwriting of The Beatles, The Black Keys, and Led Zeppelin, Kingsborough form a bond with fans by unleashing a brand of potent rock n\u2019 roll that No Depression calls \u201claced with a vintage elegance that appeals to an ever-changing audience.\u201d\n\nProduced by Grammy-nominated producer Damien Page Lewis (Rihanna, Katy Perry), Kingsborough\u2019s second album, 1544, turned out the singles \u201cLow Down\" and \u201cSubtle Lies.\u201d Both tracks spent six weeks in the top 200 of American college radio and as featured tracks on Spotify\u2019s Blues & Roots Rock playlist.\n\nKingsborough match the radio success of 1544 with an equally compelling live show. With lead singer Kingsborough projecting what The Bay Bridged describes as \u201cthe animation of a live wire,\u201d the rest of the band more than hold their own on stage via heavy grooves, classic riffs, and soaring solos.\n\nAccording to Leach, Kingsborough views each live performance as an opportunity to break down the walls that often separate artists and audiences:\n\n\u201cOn stage, we try to recreate the energy and emotion that inspired the songs, all with the hope that we can connect with people. We want our shows to be a conversation with our audience, a back and forth flow of energy. If we can allow them to escape for a few hours, we feel good about what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThis purposeful plan of action for the stage has paid great dividends: Kingsborough\u2019s infectious live energy has earned them opening slots for Dorothy, Joan Jett, Robert Cray, and ZZ Top.\n\nBilly Kingsborough and Leach formed Kingsborough in 2010 as a gritty rock n\u2019 roll band with roots in the blues. Inspired by their musical heroes of yesteryear and countless voyages across the Golden Gate Bridge, Kingsborough and Leach immediately began penning songs about love, loss, and lost identities.\n\nNever ones to tolerate complacency, the band are now prepared to take Kingsborough to new places. They will enter the studio in 2019 to record an album that Leach calls \u201cevidence of our sonic evolution.\u201d Their tour of Europe in early 2020 will support that album. All the while, Kingsborough intend to soak up new inspirations and influences by collaborating with some of the Bay Area\u2019s most accomplished musicians.\n\nKingsborough and Leach are eager to embrace the bliss and the blues that come from running headfirst into the unknown.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Lagwagon", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9563801.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Power Pop Metal Punk ?", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "You know the deal.

He\u2019s just as at home remixing Kenny Larkin or Rihanna as he is dropping multiple underground hits. DJ-wise, his relentless touring of every major city, festival and, basement after-party around the world has only enriched this unique perspective on music.\n\nRaised in Detroit and now based in Venice Beach, Barclay Crenshaw created the quirky alias \"Claude VonStroke\" in 2005 and went on to become one of the most well-respected label owners and DJs in dance music. His first release, 'Deep Throat' was a hit, putting his imprint on the decks of DJs around the globe. But the real breakthrough came with double-header \u2018The Whistler/Who\u2019s Afraid of Detroit?.\u2019 The 12\u201d cemented Claude's reputation as a producer to be reckoned with, crossing borders, genres, and musical ears, and is now known as one of the classic dance releases of the decade.\n\nSince then, VonStroke has released three original artist albums, a remix album, and several high profile mix compilations. Highlights include a collaboration with the legendary P-Funk bassist Bootsy Collins as well as a few #1 & #2 hits on Beatport. Most importantly, VonStroke has kept it original, fun and funky.\n\nAs the owner of the record labels, Dirtybird & Mothership, VonStroke also built an impeccable A&R roster signing acts like Justin Martin, Julio Bashmore, Catz 'n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Maetrik, Italoboyz, Justin Jay, and Shiba San well before they broke out of their hometown scenes (he even named a few of these artists.) Today, his labels continue to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty-bass, and electronica. Staying true to Crenshaw\u2019s Detroit heritage, Dirtybird and Mothership donate 10% of profits to a children\u2019s music school in Detroit.\n\nA lot of Claude\u2019s success can be attributed to a good attitude. He does not scowl and look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and truly loves his fans. He is grateful to be doing music for a living and knows that the reason people go to parties is to shake their asses and have fun.\n\nCatch him play at numerous festivals and clubs worldwide, or, even better, at his legendary Dirtybird BBQ series of outdoor events or his Dirtybird Campout festival.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Seisiun", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.460518, 37.783375], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Plough and the Stars", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Seisi\u00fan at Plough & Stars: Throwing back pints to a live soundtrack of traditional jigs and reels gives this Richmond watering hole a notably authentic Irish feel.

His next EP, Parallelism is slated to be released with Future Classic on November 6.\n\nInspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers.

Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet players Eric Bloom and Rashawn Ross deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy oftheir incendiary live show.\n\nProduced by Lettuce and Co-Produced recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on\nCrush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms\nstyle, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the\ngroove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\n\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \u201cSilverdome\u201d or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \u201cOresteia,\u201d Lettuce maneuver through Crush\u2019s kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \u201cMore so than any of the records we\u2019ve done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cInstead of going at it like, \u2018Here\u2019s a melody, now here\u2019s a guitar solo, here\u2019s another\nmelody, here\u2019s a sax solo,\u2019 everyone\u2019s leaning on each other in a way that\u2019s completely unspoken. It\u2019s all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee\nas undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage!in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\n\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act. And in making Crush, the band had no trouble harnessing the spirit of their explosive live show. \u201cSome of these shows we\u2019ve played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it\u2019s like you go home a different person,\u201d says Coomes. \u201cI\u2019m sure\nremembering those moments in our minds and our hearts helped bring out something special when we were recording these new songs.\u201d\n\nSo while Crush offers everything from all-out party jams to headphone-ready journeys into space funk, each track was born from an unabashed joy and love of live performance. \u201cThat energy we get when it\u2019s prime time and we\u2019re about to go onstage and we\u2019re just excited beyond belief\u2014that all came out on this new album,\u201d says Deitch. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the band is rising, and it\u2019s a really beautiful thing.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Jane Bunnett & Maqueque", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Afro-Cuban New Year's Eve Dance Party with Jane Bunnett & Maqueque feat.

Fuck pandering. Fuck fakeness. Fuck fear.\u201d Fantastic Negrito is the incarnation of a musician who is reborn after going through a lot of awful shit. In fact, the name Fantastic Negrito represents his third rebirth, literally coming back from death this time. The narrative on this man is as important as the sound, because the narrative is the sound. Songs born from a long hard life channeled through black roots music. Slide guitar, drums, piano. Urgent, desperate, edgy. Fantastic Negrito is the story of a man who struggled to \u201cmake it\u201d, who \u201cgot it\u201d, and who lost it all. For anyone who ever felt like it was over yet hoped it wasn\u2019t, this is your music; blues harnessed, forged in realness. For anyone who ever considered getting their old high-school band back together, this is your inspiration. These are singular songs by a true musician who writes and produces. They are his fuel as he embarks on the third comeback of his life.\n\nThe first life (\u2018who am I and where am I going?\u2019). Fantastic Negrito was raised in an orthodox Muslim household. His father was a Somali-Caribbean immigrant who mostly played traditional African music. When, at the age of 12, Negrito\u2019s family moved from Massachusetts to Oakland, he was hit with an intense culture shock. Oakland in 1970s was a million miles from Negrito\u2019s conservative childhood. He went from Arab chants to Funkadelic in one day, living in the heart of one of the wildest, most infamous, most vibrant black communities in the nation. Shit was extra real in Oakland.\n\nBy the time he was 20, Negrito had taught himself to play every instrument he could get his hands on. He was recording music, but he was also caught up in street shit. This went on for several years until a near death encounter with masked gunmen. After that Negrito packed his bags and headed to LA, armed with a demo on cassette.\n\nThe second life (\u2018I want to be a star\u2026I think\u2019). It didn\u2019t take long for Negrito to find himself entrenched in the \u2018Hollywood\u2019 lifestyle; \u201cclubs and bitches and bullshit politics that have nothing to do with great music.\u201d Negrito signed with a big time manager and soon after that, a million dollar deal at Interscope \u2026and soon after that, creative death.\n\nThe record deal was a disaster. Gangsta rap was ruling the airwaves and Negrito was in the wrong place at the wrong era. Negrito came out of the deal with a failed album and his confidence gutted. He was infected by the constant emphasis on \u2018what would sell\u2019; which looks, hooks and gimmicks would attract an audience. He lost all sense of himself. The songs stopped coming to him, so he quit. He sold all of his shit and he quit.\n\nIn 2000, Negrito was in a near fatal car accident that put him in a coma. For four weeks it was touch and go. Because his muscles atrophied while bedridden, he had to go through months of frustrating physical therapy to regain use of his legs. Rods were placed throughout his body. And worst of all, his playing hand was mutilated. Though he rehabbed intensely for several years, the damage was permanent. In 2008, he returned home to Oakland.\n\nThe third life (the birth of Negrito). Back in Oakland, Negrito forgot about life as a musician. He got married, he planted vegetables, raised his own chickens, and made money growing weed. He also settled into being a man, on his own, clear of the distractions of wanting to be a star. This is when his specific POV of the world came into focus. His conservative Muslim values melded with the liberal, multi-cultural world of Oakland. The cynicism that comes from struggle made room for the hope that comes from cheating death. He truly knew who he was. He was confident about his place in the world because he understood it as much as any man can. And then his son Kyu was born.\n\nWith Kyu\u2019s entrance into the world, all the creative energy Negrito bottled for years came rushing. His musical choices were sharp and without doubt. He began recording without the hindrances that come with chasing trends. \u201cFuck what\u2019s hot now, what moves me?\u201d Negrito turned to the original DNA of all American music, the Blues. The beating life had given him primed him to channel his literal and musical forefathers: the Blues musicians of the Delta.\n\nFor Fantastic Negrito, \u201cderivative\u201d is the devil so to ensure his sound is his own, every chord comes from a place of immediacy. Immediacy opens the door for instinct. Instinct is God\u2019s tool that makes an artist into an individual. Negrito leaves the original sounds of Lead Belly and Skip Woods intact and builds bridges to modernity by looping and sampling his own live instruments.\n\nWhen you listen to Negrito, you\u2019re invited to hear the story of life after destruction. Your dream can die. You probably will give up. But from there, you can start everything over.\n\nFantastic Negrito EP out now\nhttp://blackballuniverse.bandcamp.com/album/fantasic-negrito-ep\nhttp://open.spotify.com/album/205ozCsqCFqgqFuT6zXzw6\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fantastic-negrito-ep/id968215538", "otherInfo": "Fantastic Negrito - 2 Night NYE Residency at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Make It Funky", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6206824.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Mark Farina headlines the main room all night and the Make It Funky crew takes over the Loft w/ special guest Pat Mahoney (LCD Soundsystem)"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Preservation Hall Jazz Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9035809.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "\"The Past and Promise of American Music...\"\u2014Rolling Stone Magazine", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 8pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Tuesday December 17"}, {"Address": "101 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "MAITRE D", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "New Year's Eve 2020: Afrolicious (Live) ~ Ozgood ~ Braza! ~ Maitre D ~ I Can't Dance Records"}, {"Address": "630 Park Court, Rohnert Park, CA 94928", "Artist": "Los Canarios De Michoacan", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8426279.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.725157, 38.357333], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "Genres: Regional Mexicano", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ballroom at Graton Resort", "moreBioInfo": "Ra\u00fal Nava (ARPA, VIOLIN) Y VOZ, naci\u00f3 en Coalcom\u00e1n Michoac\u00e1n.

Fuck pandering. Fuck fakeness. Fuck fear.\u201d Fantastic Negrito is the incarnation of a musician who is reborn after going through a lot of awful shit. In fact, the name Fantastic Negrito represents his third rebirth, literally coming back from death this time. The narrative on this man is as important as the sound, because the narrative is the sound. Songs born from a long hard life channeled through black roots music. Slide guitar, drums, piano. Urgent, desperate, edgy. Fantastic Negrito is the story of a man who struggled to \u201cmake it\u201d, who \u201cgot it\u201d, and who lost it all. For anyone who ever felt like it was over yet hoped it wasn\u2019t, this is your music; blues harnessed, forged in realness. For anyone who ever considered getting their old high-school band back together, this is your inspiration. These are singular songs by a true musician who writes and produces. They are his fuel as he embarks on the third comeback of his life.\n\nThe first life (\u2018who am I and where am I going?\u2019). Fantastic Negrito was raised in an orthodox Muslim household. His father was a Somali-Caribbean immigrant who mostly played traditional African music. When, at the age of 12, Negrito\u2019s family moved from Massachusetts to Oakland, he was hit with an intense culture shock. Oakland in 1970s was a million miles from Negrito\u2019s conservative childhood. He went from Arab chants to Funkadelic in one day, living in the heart of one of the wildest, most infamous, most vibrant black communities in the nation. Shit was extra real in Oakland.\n\nBy the time he was 20, Negrito had taught himself to play every instrument he could get his hands on. He was recording music, but he was also caught up in street shit. This went on for several years until a near death encounter with masked gunmen. After that Negrito packed his bags and headed to LA, armed with a demo on cassette.\n\nThe second life (\u2018I want to be a star\u2026I think\u2019). It didn\u2019t take long for Negrito to find himself entrenched in the \u2018Hollywood\u2019 lifestyle; \u201cclubs and bitches and bullshit politics that have nothing to do with great music.\u201d Negrito signed with a big time manager and soon after that, a million dollar deal at Interscope \u2026and soon after that, creative death.\n\nThe record deal was a disaster. Gangsta rap was ruling the airwaves and Negrito was in the wrong place at the wrong era. Negrito came out of the deal with a failed album and his confidence gutted. He was infected by the constant emphasis on \u2018what would sell\u2019; which looks, hooks and gimmicks would attract an audience. He lost all sense of himself. The songs stopped coming to him, so he quit. He sold all of his shit and he quit.\n\nIn 2000, Negrito was in a near fatal car accident that put him in a coma. For four weeks it was touch and go. Because his muscles atrophied while bedridden, he had to go through months of frustrating physical therapy to regain use of his legs. Rods were placed throughout his body. And worst of all, his playing hand was mutilated. Though he rehabbed intensely for several years, the damage was permanent. In 2008, he returned home to Oakland.\n\nThe third life (the birth of Negrito). Back in Oakland, Negrito forgot about life as a musician. He got married, he planted vegetables, raised his own chickens, and made money growing weed. He also settled into being a man, on his own, clear of the distractions of wanting to be a star. This is when his specific POV of the world came into focus. His conservative Muslim values melded with the liberal, multi-cultural world of Oakland. The cynicism that comes from struggle made room for the hope that comes from cheating death. He truly knew who he was. He was confident about his place in the world because he understood it as much as any man can. And then his son Kyu was born.\n\nWith Kyu\u2019s entrance into the world, all the creative energy Negrito bottled for years came rushing. His musical choices were sharp and without doubt. He began recording without the hindrances that come with chasing trends. \u201cFuck what\u2019s hot now, what moves me?\u201d Negrito turned to the original DNA of all American music, the Blues. The beating life had given him primed him to channel his literal and musical forefathers: the Blues musicians of the Delta.\n\nFor Fantastic Negrito, \u201cderivative\u201d is the devil so to ensure his sound is his own, every chord comes from a place of immediacy. Immediacy opens the door for instinct. Instinct is God\u2019s tool that makes an artist into an individual. Negrito leaves the original sounds of Lead Belly and Skip Woods intact and builds bridges to modernity by looping and sampling his own live instruments.\n\nWhen you listen to Negrito, you\u2019re invited to hear the story of life after destruction. Your dream can die. You probably will give up. But from there, you can start everything over.\n\nFantastic Negrito EP out now\nhttp://blackballuniverse.bandcamp.com/album/fantasic-negrito-ep\nhttp://open.spotify.com/album/205ozCsqCFqgqFuT6zXzw6\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fantastic-negrito-ep/id968215538", "otherInfo": "Fantastic Negrito - 2 Night NYE Residency at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Deadmau5", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9050549.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.417316, 37.778083], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "Genres: Electronica", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "relax, its just music.", "otherInfo": "18 AND OVER ONLY"}, {"Address": "900 Marin St, San Francisco, USA", "Artist": "Rachel Torro", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7910620.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.386006, 37.749454], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Deep House", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Midway Patio", "moreBioInfo": "San Francisco deep house DJ / soundcloud.com/racheltorro", "otherInfo": "The Midway Presents:NYE 2020 with Bonobo & More TBATuesday, December 31st 21 + Event Interested in bottle service?

Having built a career and reputation spanning over fifteen years, this humble, authentic and charming artist has grown from club DJ to festival king to multi-million selling record producer taking success in his stride. Having trademarked his unique infusion of house and electro early on, his music continues to inspire and evolve whilst still remaining true to the very core of the Benassi sound. There is no better place to start delving into the rich history of the Benassi career than with his global smash \u201cSatisfaction\u201d. Spiralling this local DJ to international success overnight, \u201cSatisfaction\u201d and its game-changing music video were the launch pad into stardom for Benny. Created with his cousin and producer, Alle Benassi, and inspired by the car horns outside an open street facing window, this single spiralled into the charts with a #1 in France, #2 in the UK and Germany. His then debut album Hypnotica naturally followed suit, reaching top 20 across nearly all parts of Europe within the first month of release. The next few years for Benny were a culmination of successes, whether it be the major festivals he went on the play (Coachella, EDC, Ultra Music Festival, Tomorrowland to name a few) or his next artist album, Rock N Rave in 2008. The same year he won a Grammy Award for his ground breaking remix of Public Enemy \u201cBring The Noise\u201d further catapulting the Benassi name into stardom. In 2011, Benny teamed up with a star-studded album cast for his album Electroman which featured T-Pain, Kelis, Jean-Baptsiste and Apl.de.ap amongst others and most famously Gary Go with his chart-topping single \u201cCinema\u201d. The Skrillex remix of \u201cCinema\u201d not only went Gold in the US and platinum in Australia and Canada but won the Benassi\u2019s another Grammy whilst holding firm in the iTunes top 10 dance chart for over 6 months. Still on this exceptional career high, Benny Benassi combined talents with Chris Brown to create one of the biggest cross-over dance records of its time with \u201cBeautiful People\u201d. The following years have been a measure of incredible world tours and releases, most notably his record \u201cDance The Pain Away\u201d with John Legend, which premiered live on stage at Coachella with John himself. 2016 saw Benny released his first album in five years Danceaholic, an unexpected, stunning cocktail of already released tracks, two unreleased reworks of older singles and brand new songs, led by the hit summer anthem \u201cParadise\u201d, once again with Chris Brown. \u201cParadise\u201d stayed in the Top 50 UK charts for 10 weeks and boasts more than 50 million video views and close to 40 million Spotify streams. Beyond his own productions he brought his sound to a wider musical audience with a flurry of high-profile remixes with the likes of Bobby Marley & The Wailers, Giorgio Moroder and the Rolling Stones, to name but a few; whilst maintaining a weekly radio show on the US heavy-weight iHeart Radio broadcasting to a staggering quarter of a billion listeners monthly. Suffice to say if you can\u2019t go far without hearing the name Benassi and it\u2019s for a very good reason. Benny Benassi is the Legend with something to say. https://www.instagram.com/bennybenassi http://www.facebook.com/bennybenassi http://www.soundcloud.com/benny-benassi http://www.twitter.com/bennybenassi http://www.bennybenassi.com '2 My House' Out Now: http://smarturl.it/2MyHouse", "otherInfo": "NYE 2020 feat. Benny Benassi\nThe fashionable, fun, and sometimes freaky sound of Milan-born DJ/producer Benny Benassi first hit the charts under that name in 2002 with the electro-meets-house single \"Satisfaction.\" Created in collaboration with his cousin Alle Benassi -- in a team that would become known as Benassi Bros. -- it was praised by high-profile DJs such as Carl Cox, Darren Emerson, and Roger Sanchez. Although \"Satisfaction\" charted internationally, it wasn't the first time that Benassi had tasted success. In 2001, under the name KMC, he had worked with vocalist Dhany on the infectious \"I Feel So Fine,\" which initially stormed the Italian charts before it hit the number one spot in the U.K. By September 2003, the campy and quirky Hypnotica was issued as Benassi's solo debut album in collaboration with The Biz, a vocal team that featured Paul French and Violeta. A year later, Pumphonia marked the first full-length release under the Benassi Bros. name, and by the end of 2004 he had won the European Borders Breakers Award for Hypnotica, when it racked up the most sales that year for an Italian album outside of Italy.\nA second Benassi Bros. album, ...Phobia, appeared in 2005 before he went on to consolidate and improve his reputation on the DJ circuit with a number of prestigious headline festival performances. His summer 2007 remix of Public Enemy's \"Bring the Noise\" went on to win a Grammy in early 2008, further enhancing his profile and leading to work with big names such as David Bowie and Madonna. Summer 2008 brought another solo album, Rock 'n' Rave, but it was 2011's Electroman that featured some of his most internationally successful material: the Kelis-fronted \"Spaceship,\" the Chris Brown-led \"Beautiful People,\" and the Gary Go collaboration \"Cinema.\" The year 2012 was marked by Benassi's production work on Madonna's MDNA, and 2013 brought \"Dance the Pain Away,\" a solo single that featured John Legend. ~ David Jeffries & James Wilkinson, Rovi\nLVL55 music DJ Shabazz\nContact us at 415.312.3668 or vip@templesf.com for reservations.\nThis is a 21+ event."}, {"Address": "243 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Stan Erhart Band", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408656, 37.786085], "Date": "Tue Dec 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-31", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Johnny Foley's Irish House", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Stan Erhart Band at Johnny Foley's Irish House: Music lovers cherish the intimate cellar underneath Johnny Foley's Irish Pub, where songsmiths like Ron Sexsmith, Josh Rouse, and Lisa Loeb have all performed.

More recently, he\u2019s been selected for Mixmag\u2019s coveted Impact series, finding a global audience for his burgeoning project.\n\nSupport by: deadmau5, Lane 8, Above & Beyond, KCRW, Mixmag, Billboard, Dancing Astronaut", "otherInfo": "Deadmau5's house/techno alter ego TESTPILOT makes his Bay Area debut for a special LATE NIGHT NYE party with RINZEN & QRION!"}, {"Address": "119 Utah St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Julius Papp", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6310748.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.406803, 37.768186], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Soulful House Music, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul, Deep House, Disco, Nu Disco, Downtempo", "Time": "4:00 AM", "Venue": "The Great Northern", "moreBioInfo": "Julius Papp is one whose dedication to music has propelled his career as a producer and DJ in the dance/club music scene. His dance music roots lie in Disco of the 70\u2019s and New Wave of the 80\u2019s. Presently living in San Francisco, he was born and raised in Montreal, Canada, and got tuned into dance music through the city\u2019s flourishing club scene and diverse radio broadcasts. He started collecting vinyl records in the mid 70\u2019s and took to the turntables in 1985, scoring his first major club gig two years later. Hearing the non-stop flow of music and observing the booth where the DJ seamlessly blended each selection were early influences for Julius. Later influences included reading about DJ residencies that were piloted by talented club music programmers that even today, influence the youngest of aspiring DJ\u2019s - legends like David Mancuso at The Loft & Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York City to Frankie Knuckles at The Warehouse in Chicago and Tony Humphries\u2019 weekly at Zanzibar in New Jersey. Always inspired by the music listed in those articles, Julius would shop for those titles that would later become classics, worshipped by their discerning audiences. To this day, his goal is to keep expanding his foundation in music by being open-minded and eclectic in absorbing the music that truly touches him. That open-minded attitude is what Julius uses to fine-tune his musical palette, which gives him a dominant sound that exudes a deep and soulful perspective. That dominant sound is (Soulful) House Music \u2013 which to him, is about an uplifting positive message. People coming together in unity, with no barriers or restrictions, but rather, with tolerance and the spirit of music, unifying everyone on the dance-floor. That being said, he blends various musical styles together - including Soul, Latin, Afro, Disco, Jazz and Electronic sounds with such fluidity, that it is difficult at times to put a defining stamp on his sound. Contributing to that is his willingness to take a chance. He always tries to push the envelope by introducing music that deserves exposure, taking his audience on a musical journey with various mood and energy changes. Not content to limiting his ambitions in the DJ booth, Julius began producing music in 1994. The studio was another outlet for Julius\u2019 creative ideas to flow. His first release was a down-tempo project on the Acid Jazz tip. He also drew attention as part of the jazz and funk scene in San Francisco via the Mushroom Jazz parties alongside resident Mark Farina. As Julius\u2019 production catalogue grew, so did the amount of labels he released music on including \u2013 long tenured labels like King ST (NYC), Nervous Records (NYC), Large Music (Chicago) and OM (SF), to signings on Soulfuric Recordings (FL) and Kenny Dope\u2019s \u201cDope Wax\u201d (NYC) label, as well as Bob Sinclar\u2019s own Yellow Productions in Paris. He also ventured into the label arena with his own \u201cNeoDisco Music\u201d imprint. Named after the sound that continues to inspire him \u2013 the label offers him an alternate outlet to release his own productions. As a veteran in the club scene, Julius has refined a style of dance music that has taken him beyond the boundaries of San Francisco to global praise and recognition. Being nominated as \u201cMost Innovative Producer\u201d at the 2004 House Music Awards is a perfect example of that. Putting him in the company of other nominated producers like, Joey Negro, Osunlade, DJ Gregory, DJ Spinna and Ben Watt was an absolute honor for him. Upcoming releases for 2014 include a compilation/mix CD entitled \u201cA Long Hot Summer\u201d on King ST Recordings (NYC) as well as Julius\u2019 next full-length, artist-album, plus several singles. Recent production highlights include; Julius\u2019s collaboration with Lisa Shaw entitled \u201cWay Back,\u201d (DJ Smash Brooklyn Tech Remix), featured on the CBS crime drama, CSI: Miami; The song \u201cBelieve\u201d (with Deep Culture & Deborah Bond), included on Danny Krivit\u2019s 10 Year Anniversary, 718 Sessions, compilation/mix CD on Nervous Records. \u201cMusic Is The Key.\u201d Music Producer / DJ", "otherInfo": "On New Years Day 2020 The Great Northern and Space Cowboys are back with SF\u2019s biggest block party\u2026..It\u2019s A New Day x Breakfast of Champions"}, {"Address": "119 Utah St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Benjamin K", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8418285.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.406803, 37.768186], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "Genres: Sex, R&b, Love, Electronic, Rnb-soul, House, R&b/soul, Deep House, Breaks", "Time": "4:00 AM", "Venue": "The Great Northern", "moreBioInfo": "\"It's a booty shakin sort of a thing.

His musical journey began after picking up a guitar in his early teenage years and his first outlet was writing songs and playing in Dub/Reggae bands. Although Migs always loved and listened to all different styles of music, in the early 90\u2019s he connected to the soulful sounds of Deep House. By the mid \u201990s he began experimenting with producing electronic dance music. And by the time the new millennium dawned, a string of releases and remixes on numerous leading indie dance labels earned him an enviable reputation among discerning dance music fans worldwide. As Petalpusher, he\u2019d also become a stalwart of the hugely influential Naked Music stable with his original productions, remixes and compilations.\n\nBut even bigger things were to follow.\n\nRead full bio here: http://miguelmigs.com/bio", "otherInfo": "On New Years Day 2020 The Great Northern and Space Cowboys are back with SF\u2019s biggest block party\u2026.It\u2019s A New Day x Breakfast of Champions.

His early love of piano lead to a passion for keyboards and synthesizers. Teenage nights lost in the work of Daft Punk, A Tribe Called Quest and Herbie Hancock followed. Then came a stint at Princeton University, where he shelved an Engineering degree to dive into the musical abyss.\n\nKnowing what he had to do, he moved to the house music epicenter of Chicago, where he tirelessly passed out demos to local DJs and scoured the web for people with whom he could share and expand on his sound.\n\nThe stars aligned when he had a chance encounter with Perseus, founder of new label, French Express. A fellow junkie and fan of French House and R&B-infused dance music, Perseus became a friend and mentor, the Splinter to Boots' Donatello. The label eventually disbanded but Boots has stayed true to his mission of making dance tracks that can\u2019t be confined to one style. Pete blends the music he loves - jazz, house, funk and soul - into songs that last longer than their runtime. Songs not just for DJs, but for everyone.\n\nAfter moving back to Brooklyn, Dougherty was introduced to the Anjunadeep team. His relationship with the label flourished, leading to his debut album \"First Landing.\" It\u2019s an album where cavernous club music meshes with classical melodies, warm harmonies, and bright melodic soundscapes riddled with soul.\n\n2019 sees the release of Boots' sophomore album \"Bimini Road,\" which drops Sept 6th.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "900 Marin St, San Francisco, CA 94124", "Artist": "Walker & Royce", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8472315.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.386006, 37.749454], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "Genres: Tech House, Techno, Electronic, House, Deep House", "Time": "6:00 AM", "Venue": "The Midway", "moreBioInfo": "Rules Don't Apply", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "900 Marin St, San Francisco, USA", "Artist": "Eli & Fur", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8276652.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.386006, 37.749454], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "Genres: Deep House, Electronic, Techno, House", "Time": "6:00 AM", "Venue": "The Midway Patio", "moreBioInfo": "Since their debut release in 2013, Eli & Fur have been perfecting a sound built around infectious melodies with deep, driving bass lines topped with their distinguished brooding vocals. Their sound has developed into something quite unique and has earned them respect from some of the biggest names in dance music. The duo\u2019s first release, \u2018You\u2019re So High\u2019 reached Number 3 on Hype Machine and has since picked up over 6 million plays online. \u2018Seeing is Believing\u2019 saw the girls collaborate with Shadow Child, \u2018Feel The Fire\u2019 came on Anjunadeep followed by \u2018Your Eyes\u2019 which saw them team up with Beatport in the first ever Artist Partnership on the streaming platform. Their \u2018California Love\u2019 EP dropped in November 2015 & supported by their North America Tour it undoubtedly was the motivation behind such a connected & embracing audience. 2016 saw further collaborations with Erick Morillo, T\u00e2ches & Forrest as well continued releases on their own imprint NYX Music. 2015 was a pivotal year for Eli & Fur. Tipped by Beatport as 2015 Artists to Watch, they went on to pick up nominations for \u2018Best Newcomer\u2019 in The DJ Awards, \u2018Best Producer\u2019 in the Bass Music Awards, \u2018Best Breakthrough DJ\u2019 at DJ Magazine\u2019s \u2018Best of British\u2019 and more recently \u2018Best Breakthrough Artist\u2019 in the 2016 IDMA Awards. The girls rolled out 2015 with a Thelma & Louise inspired tour through North America. Documenting every step of their 15 date tour with Go-Pro, taking planes, train, automobiles and boats; dropping into radio stations, studio sessions, TV networks and clubs along the way. It was an unusual way to approach the US market but a life-time dream inspired by two of the coolest women ever to grace the big screen. The end result is the self-made video for California Love. With an impressive 2015 in the bag, 2016 was a year of continued success - a defining year for Eli & Fur. Notably the girls were awarded with the PRS Momentum fund in partnership with England Arts Council & Spotify. Not only a nod of approval from three of the most influential organisations in the business but an injection of funds at a crucial point to go towards further recordings.

One of the reasons why the Rolling Stone voted BOYS NOIZE amongst the Top10 `DJS WHO RULE THE EARTH` in 2012.\n\nAs a recording artist and producer, Ridha has created his own sound, and pioneered his own brand, amassing a formidable body of work in the process.\nHe has released three albums (2007\u2019s Oi Oi Oi , 2009\u2019s Power and 2012\u00b4s Out Of The Black) and countless singles as BOYS NOIZE, as well as doing profoundly influential work as a remixer and producer for everyone from Depeche Mode, Daft Punk, Feist, David Lynch to Jarvis Cocker, Santigold, Scissor Sisters and Chilly Gonzales.\n\nHe has collaborated with Snoop Dogg, genius film maker Mr. Oizo (on a project called Handbraekes), Erol Alkan, and most recently Skrillex (under the moniker of Dog Blood) and won Beatport's 'Best Electronic Act' 3 years in a row.\n\nRidha is also the heart of Boysnoize Records, the label that he started back in 2005. Founded originally as a means to get his own music out into the world, Boysnoize Rec.\u2014and it\u2019s sub-label, BNR Trax\u2014is now home to more than a dozen artists (including up-and-comers like 18-year old SCNTST, Le1f, Spank Rock, Strip Steve, Peaches and Siriusmo) and responsible for over 100 releases while remaining fully independent.\n\"I don\u00b4t compromise when it comes to music,\u201d says Ridha. \u201cI do what I think is cool and what I like and not what the market wants or people may expect. Maintaining artistic freedom has always been the most important thing to me \u2014 for my own music and for anyone on my label\u201d\n\nDespite his ever-expanding label roster and the increased demand for his time as a producer and remixer, Ridha\u2019s primary loves continue to be the twin pursuits of making and performing music.\nFollowing the release of his third long-player Out Of The Black in late 2012, he presented the first BOYS NOIZE 'LIVE' show to the masses.\n\u201cI really wanted to give people a concert where I perform my music only. It\u00b4s not that I don\u00b4t like DJing anymore, I\u00b4m a DJ to the bone and will always be. But playing my tracks live and putting on a completely new show was something I wanted to do for a long time. It\u00b4s different and fresh and that is what I love.\"", "otherInfo": "The Midway, Goldenvoice & SET Present\nFRESH START w/ Claptone + Elax (Boys Noize), Jeremy Olander, & Much More"}, {"Address": "900 Marin St, San Francisco, CA 94124", "Artist": "Sacha Robotti", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8774773.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.386006, 37.749454], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "Genres: Techno, House, Electronica, Electronic", "Time": "6:00 AM", "Venue": "The Midway", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/sacharobotti/biography #SachaRobotti - #SlothAcid #Dirtybird www.instagram.com/sacharobotti www.twitter.com/sacharobotti http://spoti.fi/1qIKPNi www.soundcloud.com/sacha-robotti www.residentadvisor.net/dj/sacharobotti www.beatport.com/artist/sacha-robotti/129974", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "900 Marin St, San Francisco, CA 94124", "Artist": "Fresh Start", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.386006, 37.749454], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 AM", "Venue": "The Midway", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Fresh Start w/ Claptone, Walker & Royce, Moon Boots and more"}, {"Address": "900 Marin St, San Francisco, CA 94124", "Artist": "Claptone", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9008297.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.386006, 37.749454], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "Genres: House", "Time": "6:00 AM", "Venue": "The Midway", "moreBioInfo": "In a now long forgotten world, many generations ago, a bird like shape emerged from wooded darkness, floating and fluttering, drifting and dreaming.

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing, and performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dance floor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 10 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark and sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, \"The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best, and for me this is the new wave in house music.\" He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater\u2019s booty shake. Growing up in Washington DC, Worthy was inspired by the early American rave scene. Upon moving to New York in the late 90\u2019s, he was exposed to artists like LTJ Bukem and Stacey Pullen whose music inspired him to play records across multiple genres, from techno and breaks to hiphop and drum n\u2019 bass. In 2001 he swapped coastlines, moving to San Francisco to pursue his music career. There he teamed up with Claude Von Stroke and Justin and Christian Martin, becoming one of the four founding fathers of the Dirtybird party, Worthy\u2019s breakout track, Irst Te, released on the Dirtybird label in 2007, quickly established his notoriety as a producer. With other bangers like Shy Look, Tric Trac (co-produced with Eats Everything) and the recently release track, Dip, Worthy has been rocking the \u201cDirtybird\u201d sound for nearly a decade now. Concurrently, Worthy has established his own label, Anabatic Records, which has allowed him to be a bit more experimental with his production, and expand his reach as an artist. Some of the songs that have charted on sites such as Beatport include Concubia, Work The Walls, and Flashin. In 2014 Worthy released his debut full-length album, Disbehave, a genre-defying rebellion against the house producers status quo. Breaking down rules and boundaries, Worthy has sought to set himself apart from the mundane world of expectation, striking out to release something unexpected. Disbehave was accepted with critical acclaim and received notable press attention. Early Spring 2015, Worthy will release a two part remix album of Disbehave with artists including Thugfucker, Stanton Warriors, Yolanda be Cool, Matt Tolfrey, and a slough of other amazing producers. He is also back with another Dirtybird release called \"So Delicious\", among other tracks that will be due out later this year. listen to tracks here: www.soundcloud.com/worthy See my Tour dates in the About Section", "otherInfo": "2020 brings you double the headliners, Worthy and Kevin Knapp!!"}, {"Address": "3600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Juicy", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433406, 37.764392], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, Funk, R&b/soul, Soul", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Lookout", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Juicy\" at Lookout: The elevated location, long windows, and outdoor balcony give this Castro bar its name, where queers nosh on pizza and dance to DJed music while keeping an eye open for people to meet."}, {"Address": "1822 San Pablo Ave, Berkeley, CA 94702", "Artist": "The Whiskey Brothers", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.293066, 37.870706], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Albatross Pub", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Whiskey Brothers at Albatross Pub:"}, {"Address": "2344 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Pussy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/147991.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.434294, 37.763629], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Beaux", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Pussy Party\" w/ Sasha, Ms. Jackson, and guests"}, {"Address": "2800 24th St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "MUSIC THERAPY", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408398, 37.752973], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Pop's Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Music Therapy\" w/ DJ Clave"}, {"Address": "314 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Kevin Knapp", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8400125.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413904, 37.771448], "Date": "Wed Jan 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-01", "Genre": "Genres: Trance, Techno, Tech House, Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Halcyon SF", "moreBioInfo": "Equally adept in the studio, on the decks and behind the mic, Austin-bred, San Francisco-schooled producer, DJ and vocalist, Kevin Knapp, has emerged from the bustling Bay Area dance music scene to the international spotlight. Previously popping up on a diverse selection of serious dance floor slayers with artists such as Richy Ahmed and Audiojack, his 2015 Ibiza summer hit, \u201cHeft\u201d, on Hot Creations, became the catalyst for Kevin\u2019s newfound global success as a solo producer. Since then, the world has seen him prosper on this path through celebrated productions and remixes on labels like Dirtybird, Poker Flat, Sanity, Lost, and Truesoul.\n\nBut jacking house music swing is just one element in Knapp\u2019s musical mixture. Kevin discovered his vocal proclivity at a young age in various choral and classical school groups. By adolescents, he was bumping hip-hop along with the rest of his peers, an influence that still looms large in Knapp\u2019s productions today. No wonder fellow hip-hop-influenced ravers like Claude VonStroke, Heidi, Jamie Jones and The Martinez Brothers are among the DJs caning his tracks on the global stage, along with Seth Troxler, Magda and Eats Everything.\n\nKevin made his first steps towards his musical mission in San Francisco, becoming a fixture behind the decks at infamous soirees like Satellite, Werd, As You Like It and Housepitality, eventually unveiling his early production efforts at the start of the decade, including his debut release, \u201cLike This\u201d, on Matt Tolfrey\u2019s Leftroom label. From there, it was only a matter of time before Knapp heard the clarion call of the global techno capital Berlin, relocating in early 2013 and quickly fielding calls from new neighbors like Pan-Pot, Tiefschwarz, and Sacha Robotti. His move west inspired a change of focus, delving deep into solo production work with releases on labels such as Hot Creations, Material, and his upcoming EP on VIVa Music. Since his move to Berlin, Kevin has firmly established himself as a heavyweight in the international club scene, becoming a fixture on the global circuit, gigging across the globe, from Detroit to New Dehli, London to Seoul, and appearing at industry-leading events like Paradise, Movement (DEMF), ADE and Off-Sonar Week.\n\nBig in build, talent and heart, Kevin\u2019s fierce love of music and ferocious appetite for life continues to drive his quest for aural rapture.

Studio album No.6 - \u2018WAX\u2019 - the 2nd in a trilogy, out now.\n\nSince scoring a worldwide smash with her debut album \u2018Eye To The Telescope\u2019 in 2004, which went on to sell over 5 million copies, KT Tunstall has remained at the forefront of UK singer- songwriter talent. Over the next decade, three further critically acclaimed albums followed; \u2018Drastic Fantastic\u2019, \u2018Tiger Suit\u2019 and \u2018Invisible Empire//Crescent Moon\u2019 in 2007, 2010 and 2013 respectively, keeping the platinum sales rolling and cementing the Scottish singer-songwriter\u2019s reputation as a major recording talent, as well as a mesmerising live artist.\n\nTunstall has toured the world many times over. She outsold every other female artist in the UK in 2005, won the 2006 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, won the Ivor Novello Best Song award for her huge, self-penned hit 'Suddenly I See\u2019, and a Q award for Track of the Year. She also landed a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and lent her tunes to a host of movies and TV shows ('Suddenly I See', used in the iconic opening scene of Meryl Streep flick 'The Devil Wears Prada').\n\n2012 and the years that followed saw a seismic shift in outlook - the loss of her father, a divorce, and a relocation to Venice Beach, California.\n\nAfter a period of healing, soul-searching, and a change of scenery, 2016 hailed the arrival of the first of a trilogy of albums, the critically acclaimed UK top 10 album - 'KIN'. The trilogy evokes, separately and in sequence, spirit, body and mind. With 'KIN' being her phoenix- from-the-ashes 'spirit' album, 2018 marked the second offering of that trilogy, the \u2018body\u2019 album \u2018WAX\u2019 - released October 5th.\n\nSpeaking about her 6th studio album, Tunstall says of \u2018WAX\u2019 \u201cI knew before I started writing that I wanted it to be an electric guitar record. It had to be visceral, about the physical, and the weight of that, and the obstacles of that. It\u2019s a record about human-ness, which we so often just write off as \u2018flaws\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe title a nod to the viscous pungency of one of the body\u2019s natural substances. \u201cWax evokes colonies of bees, candlelight, the material that the first long-playing records were made of\u201d, she explains, \u201cbut more than that, wax is produced inside your own head. You unconsciously create it, and then weirdly that same basic substance has been used for centuries to make the most lifelike replicas of human beings. It has a life glow to it. It sticks to you. We have these strange, ancient connections and relationships with wax. How odd is it that the body produces all these substances from all these holes!\u201d laughs this stoutly down-to-earth singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nLead single \u201cThe River\u201d, which was released August 23rd, opens with an arresting synth hook, before Tunstall\u2019s powerful voice enters, emotionally taking centre stage. The track builds with strong rhythmic guitar textures, exploding into an anthemic chorus. Heavy guitar riffs are central to this track capturing the dirt, grit and physicality of the album. Tunstall explains, \u201cit\u2019s about wanting to escape the madness in the world, escaping bad relationships, and wanting to be washed clean - emancipation through nature\u201d. The single was named one of Rolling Stone's \u2018Songs You Need To Know\u2019. The music video, directed by Alexo Wandael, premiered on Clash Magazine and features KT performing a sensual routine with dancer Alex Thomas.\n\nKT released \u2018WAX\u2019 in October 2018 via Virgin Records (UK) / Rostrum Records/ InGrooves (US / RoW). \u201cWAX\u201d entered the UK album chart at number 15 (Tunstall\u2019s 6th Top 20 album in the UK), was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018New Music Friday\u2019 playlist in a dozen countries worldwide and received critical acclaim from both national publications and specialist music outlets in both the UK and USA.\n\nThe Sunday Times - \u201cKiller folk-rock melodies and chord progressions; lyrics rich with emotional intelligence, candour, self-awareness and bite and vocals of immediacy\u201d\n\nThe I \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment she strikes the first meaty chord of her new album, KT sounds visceral capturing the grit of her live shows\u201d\n\nThe Sun 4* \u2013 \u201cWAX provides a gritty collection of classic rock-pop\u201d\n\nSecond single, \u2018Human Being\u2019, was released in December 2018, accompanied by a self- directed video by Tunstall which was premiered on NYLON and features an 8-year-old black belt nunchuck talent Eccaia Sampson. KT says of the video: \u201cMy vision for the video was to create a mirror between a young, crazy- talented, bold little girl, and link that burgeoning energy to a band of warrioress women\u201d. The track was playlisted by BBC Radio 2.\n\nThe last few years have seen something of a creative rebirth for Tunstall.
