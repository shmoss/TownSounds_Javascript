Affectionately known as the \u201cIron Man of the Mask,\u201d Franc held the title of \u201cThe World\u2019s Longest-Running Phantom\u201d for more than a decade after bringing over five million theatre-goers to their feet in a 6-1/2-year run.\n\nBut that distinction only scratches the surface of an illustrious career spanning decades, including his portrayal of the opera-singing Anthony Corleone, son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton\u2019s characters in the seven-time Academy Award-nominated film Godfather III. Franc also sang the Academy Award-winning theme song \"Speak Softly Love\" for both the film and Original Motion Picture soundtrack, garnering over one million hits on YouTube. Paramount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search for the young Corleone, auditioning more than 2,000 artists over a one-year period before casting Franc in the role. He is the first and only person ever to sing Carmine Coppola\u2019s haunting Godfather theme in the film trilogy.\n\nFranc\u2019s performance of the song so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to study at Pavarotti\u2019s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously studied at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of \u201cTony\u201d in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow\u2019s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical.\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s BROADWAY: Songs from the Great White Way, and Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, along with tributes to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, including NBC\u2019s \u201cBrian Boitano\u2019s Skating Spectacular\u201d and \u201cThe 2005 Tribute to Music on Ice\u201d with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc\u2019s performance of \u201cMusic of the Night,\u201d as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening\u2019s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nIn May 2018, Franc was honored to receive a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival. He has released three successful solo CDs, one of which has the unique distinction as the soundtrack for Barry Manilow\u2019s daily workout.

A prolific composer and prodigious six-string talent, Di Meola has amassed over 20 albums as a leader while collaborating on a dozen or so others with the likes of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia, Jean-Luc Ponty and more. And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal status among hordes of frettboard aficionados who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di Meola's writing and compositions along with the soulfulness of his guitar expressions, have won him legions of fans worldwide.\n\nA pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy and 1978's Casino, the guitar great has continued to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African music throughout his long career.\n\nDi Meola\u2019s most recent release, 2013\u2019s \"All Your Life\", was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music. So their impact was pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14 familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar. All the tracks are imbued with the guitarist\u2019s signature flamenco flourishes, intricate arpeggiating and dazzling cross-picking. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the Beatles created most of their records during their heyday, \"All Your Life\" stands as a triumph in the long and illustrious career of a bona fide guitar hero. \u201cI\u2019ve come full circle with this,\u201d says Di Meola. \u201cI started out my life loving the Beatles, and I never stopped, just like a lot of so many other guitarists from my generation. In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d\n\nDi Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar.\n\"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d\n\nA native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d\n\nFollowing a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al. After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.\n\n1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause.\n\nNow in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.\n\nVisit: http://www.aldimeola.com/#!tour/c9a0\n\nAlbum recordings can be found at:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/al-di-meola/id814570\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-di-meola-mn0000600228/discography\n\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Al+Di+Meola/+albums", "otherInfo": "This is an all ages show.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Jose, CA", "Artist": "Justin Rock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7248992.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.8261, 37.2751], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "San Pedro Market Bar w/ Sutton Marley ", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "w/ Sutton Marley Group"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Clem Snide", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9577082.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Music, Art Performance, Alt-Country, Indie Folk, Gospel", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Home Show", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cThe last ten years have been a rollercoaster of deep despair and amazing opportunities that somehow present themselves at the last possible second,\u201d says Eef Barzelay. \u201cDuring that time, the band bottomed out, my marriage was crumbling, I lost my house, and I had to declare bankruptcy. The only way to survive was to try to transcend myself, to find some kind of deeper, spiritual relationship with life. Once I committed to that, all these little miracles started happening.\u201d\n\n\u2018Forever Just Beyond,\u2019 Barzelay\u2019s stunning new album under the Clem Snide moniker, may just be the most miraculous of them all. Produced by Scott Avett, the record is a work of exquisite beauty and profound questioning, a reckoning with faith and reality that rushes headlong into the unknown and the unknowable. The songs here grapple with hope and depression, identity and perception, God and the afterlife, humanizing thorny existential issues and delivering them with the intimate, understated air of a late-night conversation between old friends. Avett\u2019s production is similarly warm and inviting, and the careful, spacious arrangement of gentle guitars and spare percussion carves a wide path for Barzelay\u2019s insightful lyrics and idiosyncratic delivery.\n\n\u201cI look up to Eef with total respect and admiration,\u201d says Avett, \u201cand I hope to survive like he survives: with total love for the new and the unknown.

His upbringing at the Maxfield Home orphanage in Kingston and being albino in Jamaica were two obstacles the he overcame and went on to be (at one time) the biggest reggae artist since Bob Marley.\n\nAfter winning a talent contest at Tastee Patties in Kingston, Yellow went on to excite reggae crowds all over Jamaica and the rest of the world with his boastful and sometimes bodacious lyrics. His ability to ride rhythm and excite a crowd made Yellow an instant hit in Jamaica. He also began to work with the Ace Sound System in St. Thomas and drew big crowds at his dancehall performances. Later in his career, Yellow began to spread out and work for a number of different producers, sometimes releasing as many as five albums per year. This led to a recording contract with CBS Records. Yellowman recorded one album with them before he was diagnosed with jaw cancer and was given six months to live. This was in 1986. After surgery an extended leave of absence from the record industry, Yellowman began his comeback with the song \"Blueberry Hill\", and his career was re-launched. His first album for RAS came from producer Phillip 'Fatis' Burrell and was called \"Yellow Like Cheese\". Coincidentally this was the start of a long and fruitful relationship with RAS and Yellowman and also RAS and 'Fatis' and his exterminator production. Yellowman has always been very professional to work with and always a respectful and reliable human being. He has managed to outlive his predicted fate of death and his performances are incredibly lively as he seems to have an unlimited amount of stage energy. We can only hope for the best for Yellowman. He has continued his hard work and his devotion to his family is to be complimented.\n\nThe rudest Dancehall toaster of the 1980s, Jamaica's albino son Yellowman made as many enemies as fans with his controversial, often overtly sexist (if tongue in cheek) lyrics.

Since then, at age thirteen he moved on to become the youngest ever to be endorsed by Gibson, earning his name for his stylings on a vintage '56 Stratocaster. Lunche's newest singles are a testament to his knack for crafting rich arrangements that are not afraid to indulge in soul leanings.\n\nSimon Lunche has packed a near lifetime of musical experience into just 21 years. As the creative force behind Bay Area based indie act, The Blondies, he's written and produced the band's entire catalog and made his name as a captivating live performer. Having spent the last decade as a frontman, Lunche now delivers a solo debut that brings a powerful new depth and even more dynamic vision to his artistry.\n\nFormed when Lunche was 9 years old, The Blondies released their acclaimed album Just Another Evening in June 2016 and toured the Western US, right around the time of his high school graduation. While several of the older band members decided to focus on finishing college, Lunche opted to forego school and pursue music full time. Despite having written The Blondies four LPs on his own, Lunche quickly found that working as a solo artist added a greater degree of creative freedom and sparked an unexpected evolution in his sound.\n\nAs he settled into finding his voice as a lead guitarist, Lunche conjured up a guitar lick and composition that would make its way to multi Grammy Award winning engineer Dave Reitzas (who's previously worked with artists ranging from Barbra Streisand to The Weeknd). While working with Dave on his mixing, he met Sean Hurley (John Mayer bassist) who is currently in production with Simon on his upcoming album. At its center is Lunche's own luscious vocals, producing lustrous guitar licks along the way that help carry the tunes forward. Rounding it up is bass from Sean Hurley, drums from Aaron Sterling, and backing vocals from Tiffany Palmer (John Mayer) and Brandon Winbush (Tori Kelly), sealing the deal on a brand of music that Lunche acknowledges as \"soul pop\".\n\nSimon is known for his dynamic live performances. Audiences claim that his guitar and voice take them to another place. He has been compared to John Mayer, Jeff Buckley, James Bay, and Ed Sheeran.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Hepa-Titus", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Slim's Presents Melvins with Cunts and Hepa.Titus"}, {"Address": "1450 1st St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Zak Fennie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9190188.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.289274, 38.297492], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Acoustic, Singer, Songwriter, Alternative, Folk, Rock, Pop, Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Andaz Napa - A Concept By Hyatt", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Mystic Roots", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7847919.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Reggae, Hip hop, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Mystic Roots Band (MRB) is a Chico, CA born, 5-piece pop reggae fusion band.

Thanks to the forward thinking programming of Laurent\u2019s local radio station and a DJ with his finger on the pulse of a golden age in the making in New York \u2013 Laurent\u2019s musical education in all things hip hop was of the highest order. An old Mac and a stack of old LPs were mere catalysts for Laurent to try and emulate the sounds from across the pond.\n\nA subsequent move to the UK introduced electronica to his broadening taste and influenced his own sound. Then followed work soundtracking short films and theater productions which added a cinematic element to his repertoire. Following a disheartening stint doing some production work for a Paris based hip hop label convinced Laurent that he should be doing things on his own terms. A self released EP led to being picked up by Illicit Recordings in London \u2013 through which \u201cMickey Mouse Operation\u201d was eventually released.

Even fewer can create a unique style which continues to set them apart from all others by being the very first in a genre they laid the foundation for. Possessed are by definition, the creators of Death Metal.\n\nPossessed took San Francisco\u2019s metal scene by storm, playing with fellow Bay Area thrashers and friends Exodus, and other bands- many now long gone. In 1982-1983, they recorded a four song demo. One of the demo tracks, \u201cSwing of the Axe\u201d ended up on the Metal Massacre 6 compilation and later on \u201cThe Best of Metal Massacre.\u201d Released in October 1985 on Combat Records, Seven Churches set a new standard for extreme music. Combining lighting fast riffs, Becerra\u2019s raspy trademark growl and speedy bass playing, Pummeling drums and Randy Burns\u2019 production, Seven Churches created a whole new genre of music- death metal. Seven Churches went on to be one of Combat Records\u2019 best-selling albums. Not bad for a quartet of high school kids!\n\nBeyond the Gates. Released on Halloween in 1986, this album was especially well-received in Europe where they toured at the end of the year. The album that changed the landscape of heavy metal, Beyond The Gates was the highest selling Combat album that year.\n\nAfter that tour, Possessed recorded and released Eyes of Horror, a five song EP produced by Joe Satriani. Musically and lyrically advanced, the album touched on dark themes such as sin, drugs and violence and, of course, the devil. Not long after the release of the EP, LaLonde (early guitars) joined up with Les Claypool and Primus. Soon after, Mike Sus (early drums) left to continue his studies at SFSU and Torrao (early guitars) decided he no longer wanted to play in a band. Becerra continued to play and joined some side projects, but mostly took time to pursue his goals in life including his attending SFSU. In 1992, while coming home from work, tragically, Jeff was shot twice by two different gunmen who were attempting to rob him. It would be seventeen-and-a-half years before Jeff was again able to resurrect Possessed after receiving literally thousands of fan letters, emails and fan support.\n\nIn 2006, Becerra joined with Sadistic Intent to record \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d for a Possessed tribute album. Becerra and Sadistic Intent decided to do a few live shows to satisfy fans who had been clamoring for shows for decades. With such a positive response, Becerra and Sadistic Intent continued to play a number of successful shows, including Wacken 2007, Maryland Deathfest 2009, and 2010\u2019s Blackest of the Black Tour. This lineup breathed life into Sadistic Intent and Becerra, and the two parties split amicably to play their own styles of metal, with drummer Emilio Marquez staying with Becerra and Possessed.\n\nAfter making several live appearances, including Graspop 2012 & The Fallen Angel 2012 European Tour, Cursed Over Europe 2014 Tour and the Evil Over Europe Tour\n2016, Possessed is primed and finally ready for a new era. The Possessed legacy has been highly influential in the realm of extreme metal, changing the genre forever. Ready to take it further, Possessed is planning several tour dates and writing new material that will change the face of death metal once more.\n\nIn 2017, Possessed joined the Nuclear Blast family.

He began co-writing and recording and producing with the New Jersey based band Dog Show Blues. During this time he also worked on what would later become his debut album. Attributing much of his inspiration to his three older brothers, he named the solo project The Fourth Son. His debut album The Fourth Son EP was released in 2014. In the winter of 2015, The Fourth Son relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, and began developing a live presence. He played at open-mic nights throughout the Bay Area, while teaching elementary physical education by day. He released his second album titled Lavenia in 2016. With an increasing number of tour dates the project has developed a unique and powerful live sound.

Deftly balancing atmospheric and airy instrumentation, thoughtful emotionality, and just the right amount of hard-hitting hypnosis, the Southern California quintet\u2014James DeBerg [vocals], Devin Chance [guitar], Josh Thomas [guitar], Josh Billimoria [bass], and Garrett Halvax [drums]\u2014descend into the dreamy depths of loss, love, and life reflected in art on their full-length debut, The Love You Let Too Close [Rise Records].\n\n\u201cWe aim to make songs that are heavy and fun, but you can also listen to them on a nighttime drive home through the rain when you\u2019re thinking about life,\u201d exclaims DeBerg. \u201cYou could call it post-hardcore rock, but it\u2019s more than that. We just want people to feel what we\u2019re feeling.\u201d\n\nThey first harnessed that energy in early 2016. After amicably parting ways with Outlands, the frontman quietly kept writing music. One day, Thomas presented him some demos of \u201cthese pretty sad jams,\u201d and they dove headfirst into a collaboration together. Blindwish guitarist Chance joined the fold next followed by Billmoria and Halvax as the boys hit a San Diego studio to record. Rise Records became entranced by the initial output as well as the cinematic, self-funded video for \u201cTradition\u201d and offered the band a deal. Handpicking the collaborative team, they finished recording with producer Sebastian Rizo, enlisting the mixing talents of Andreas Magnusson [Fit For A King] and Kris Crummett [Sleeping With Sirens, Issues] for mastering.\n\nOver this rich sonic backdrop, DeBerg openly explores the suicide of his best friend and its aftermath on The Love You Let Too Close.\n\n\u201cThe theme of my life\u2019s descent is central to the record,\u201d he admits. \u201cLosing my best friend flipped my whole world upside down and changed who I am as a person. I used to be happy-go-lucky. I smiled through everything in life. It wasn\u2019t the same after. The songs go through my healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms as well as the other feelings that came about during this really low and depressed period. I fell in love during a broken time, but I pushed back too. This is a chronicle of everything I noticed about myself.\u201d\n\nOn the first single \u201cNo Place Like You,\u201d solemn piano chords resound over a haze of feedback before guitars swell into a wave of emotion on the captivating chorus chant.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make that one a little bit lighter,\u201d says DeBerg. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly singing. Lyrically, it\u2019s about being so depressed that it screws up a relationship with someone you care for a lot.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the record, the opener \u201cSinking Me\u201d builds from a bombastic beat awash in lush guitar tones before snapping into a searing scream. Meanwhile, the title track encapsulates both extremes, shifting from delicate to deadly.\n\nThe Love You Let Too Close ignites Thousand Below\u2019s journey. As they tour with everyone from The Devil Wears Prada to Veil Of Maya, listeners will undoubtedly fall under their spell, because each lyric and note are unequivocally real.\n\n\u201cI enjoy writing sad music,\u201d DeBerg leaves off. \u201cIt\u2019s a very therapeutic process that helps me.

The band also earned itself a rabid following, with fans especially enamored of Lynn\u2019s feisty vocals and brutally personal lyrics about challenging relationships with lovers and family members as well as her relationship with herself. \u201cPeople really treasure that album,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe got tons of letters from people saying it saved their life. They\u2019re people who are conflicted and searching and they connect with Patty\u2019s lyrics more than anything.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for The Wind and The Wave to make their second album, Baker says he and Lynn felt \u201csome bit of an obligation to deliver that again.\u201d The band definitely delivered on their sophomore album, Happiness Is Not A Place, and the result is the sound of a band that has stretched itself and grown. Lynn managed to dig a little deeper with her lyrics, exploring her difficult feelings on commitment, and family, while acknowledging her own frantic mind. And the band\u2019s sonic palette is nervier, thanks to the album being recorded live by producer Butch Walker. \u201cTo me, it sounds reckless with a rock and roll spirit and attitude, an \u2018I don\u2019t give a fuckedness,\u2019 if you will. I wanted it to make sense to our fans, but to feel like a step forward musically. And I think we accomplished that. It\u2019s really rough around the edges, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency and pent-up stuff that probably came from both Patty and my nervousness about making a record with an outside producer.\u201d\n\nAfter being dropped by two major labels, all expectations and second guesses went flying out the window. The band\u2019s third full length album, Human Beings Let You Down, was a record made in hotels and backstage dressing rooms across the US. \u201cGetting married was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Lynn, \u201cBut it also brought out a lot, good and bad, and therapy helped me work through it. That\u2019s what the song Neon Prayer Flags is all about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta tough to be Patty, or anyone in her life, because if something\u2019s amiss, she\u2019s going to write about it. And you\u2019re going to know it\u2019s about you, and you\u2019re going to feel weird about it,\u201d Baker says with a chuckle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in the line of fire. Patty and I are two people who, while we strive to be joyful and positive, can be very much morose and negative, and that definitely comes out in the songs.\u201d\n\nThe band is currently working on their fourth album, and will embark on a series of acoustic mini tours in 2020, called The Feelings Club.", "otherInfo": "Come be a part of The Feelings Club. Dwight and Patty will be sharing personal stories behind the songs you have loved and lived.

You\u2019ll be able to submit questions, just like on The Dwight and Patty Show podcast, and they\u2019ll answer them throughout the show.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something really nice about playing these songs in such an intimate way.

He is equally at home playing with jazz veteran Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish sean-n\u00f3s singer Roisin El Safty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata. And at heart, he is a jazz improviser.\n\nTurrisi, it\u2019s safe to say, is a musical polyglot par excellence and it\u2019s natural that he feels at home in multiple musical settings for his vocabulary is a colorful weave of early music, pan-Mediterranean modal melodies and European flavored jazz.\n\nIn spite of his numerous collaborations it\u2019s as a leader that Turrisi has earned his spurs. His four beautifully crafted solo albums and two co-led releases have garnered widespread critical acclaim.\nFor Turrisi, tradition and improvisation are not different countries but two sides of the same mountain. Turrisi\u2019s musical traditions - formal and folkloric - span the centuries and a large swathe of the history of European migration. This kaleidoscopic vocabulary - always in flux - provides the grist to Turrisi\u2019s improvisational mill and the rough material from which he crafts his uniquely original, haunting music.\nHis ability to rework ancient melodies and rhythms through a contemporary jazz prism marks him out as one of the most striking voices to have emerged on the European jazz scene in the past decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5104 Hopyard Rd, Pleasanton, CA 94588", "Artist": "The SOULKorean Comedian", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9117674.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.905155, 37.698093], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Spoken, karoake, ted talk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Tommy T's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Eric Shun The SOUL Korean Comedian tells his story as a Stand-Up Comedian.

Combining influences that span decades, Natasha\u2019s work dwells in the elemental, emerging in timeless forms. Natasha Khan first captured our imagination way back in 2006 with a set of distinctively haunting and rich, darkly phantasmagoric songs ripe with magic realism. Her sensual and gilt-decorated dream world was opened up in two Mercury Music Prize nominated albums, the atavistic, reverb-drenched Fur and Gold (2006) and 2009\u2019s more electronically poppy Two Suns. The latter featured the irresistible Daniel \u2013 which won Ms Khan an Ivor Novello award for Best Contemporary Song \u2013 and was recorded in London and across America. Bat for Lashes continues to win over the hearts of the nation having made a triumphant return last year with the highly acclaimed third album The Haunted Man. A richly layered and accomplished record, it pulls Khan\u2019s distinctive creative vision into sharper focus, confirming her as a true innovator and an established UK artist. Khan has since been nominated for \u2018Best Female at the Brit Awards and the beautiful track \u2018Laura\u2019, one of the 2012\u2019s best, was nominated for an Ivor Novello for \u2018Best Song Musically And Lyrically\u2019, and was released as a limited edition 7\u201d for this year\u2019s Record Store Day. In September this year, Natasha Khan and Jon Hopkins announced a very special collaboration for the soundtrack to the upcoming British film How I Live Now, directed by Kevin Macdonald. The pair have written the beautifully sparse and atmospheric track \u2018Garden\u2019s Heart\u2019 together, a haunting and fitting tribute to the film\u2019s dark subject matter of a world war breaking out in 21st century Britain.

His brother, Andrew, is a well known concert pianist living in Boston; his brother, Bobby, lives in Paris and is a leading woodwind player in European jazz and studio scenes. His sister, Paula, is a professional singer living in New Orleans.\nRangell first played flute at the age of 15. Within months he was studying both classical and jazz music at The Interlochen Arts Academy, a national camp for gifted music students. He went on to attend The New England\nConservatory of Music in Boston. As a student he twice won Down Beat Magazine's prestigious National Student Recording Awards competition both as best jazz and best pop/rock instrumental soloist. After college he headed to New York in 1984 to pursue his career.\nThe next four years were spent \"paying dues\", sitting in, playing alongside, and gigging with some of the world's greatest contemporary jazz musicians including Hiram Bullock, Jorge Dalto, Eric Gale, Richard Tee, Jaco Pastorius, David Sanborn, Michael Brecker and many others. He also found occasional employment with the legendary Gil Evans Monday Night Orchestra and worked on many commercial jingle recording sessions. Rangell's debut album was released on Gaia/Gramavision Records, but soon thereafter he was signed by Larry Rosen and Dave Grusin at GRP Records.\nA succession of albums followed at GRP where he recorded eight CDs. His stated ambition throughout these endeavors has been \"to try to consistently grow and evolve as a player and broaden my horizons as an artist while endeavoring to make music that people will feel and relate to.\" With his musical armory encompassing flute, piccolo, alto, tenor and soprano saxophone as well as whistling, he was well equipped to fulfill this desire. He has recorded with The Rippingtons, Chuck Loeb, Patti Austin, Tom Browne, and The GRP All Star Big Band to name a few and is featured on Don Grusin's Grammy nominated CD \"The Hang.\" Though Rangell has recorded mostly in the contemporary/pop and smooth jazz formats garnering top radio play and a large audience, The Times of London also notes that \"heard live a much more robust and idiosyncratic player emerges. With his discography of now 17 CD releases Nelson Rangell continues on his musical path with 2 new and unique albums, \"Red\", a collection of dedicated saxophone recordings in the pop jazz and contemporary jazz idiom and \"Blue\" which features the flute and piccolo throughout it's highly diverse 11 tracks.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1984 Bonita Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Jeremy Cohen", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272093, 37.871966], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Back Room Music", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Join us for an evening of \u201cprogressive Americana,\u201d featuring guitarist/singer-songwriter Lorin Rowan (Rowan Brothers)."}, {"Address": "555 Waverley Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301", "Artist": "Art Popular", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6153981.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.159419, 37.446914], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Samba, Pagode, International", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "All Saints Episcopal Church", "moreBioInfo": "Ap\u00f3s tocar em bares e boates de S\u00e3o Paulo por 8 anos, o Art Popular lan\u00e7ou seu primeiro disco por um selo independente em 1993, chegando a vender 170 mil c\u00f3pias e abrindo caminho para um contrato com uma grande gravadora, a EMI.

His brother, Andrew, is a well known concert pianist living in Boston; his brother, Bobby, lives in Paris and is a leading woodwind player in European jazz and studio scenes. His sister, Paula, is a professional singer living in New Orleans.\nRangell first played flute at the age of 15. Within months he was studying both classical and jazz music at The Interlochen Arts Academy, a national camp for gifted music students. He went on to attend The New England\nConservatory of Music in Boston. As a student he twice won Down Beat Magazine's prestigious National Student Recording Awards competition both as best jazz and best pop/rock instrumental soloist. After college he headed to New York in 1984 to pursue his career.\nThe next four years were spent \"paying dues\", sitting in, playing alongside, and gigging with some of the world's greatest contemporary jazz musicians including Hiram Bullock, Jorge Dalto, Eric Gale, Richard Tee, Jaco Pastorius, David Sanborn, Michael Brecker and many others. He also found occasional employment with the legendary Gil Evans Monday Night Orchestra and worked on many commercial jingle recording sessions. Rangell's debut album was released on Gaia/Gramavision Records, but soon thereafter he was signed by Larry Rosen and Dave Grusin at GRP Records.\nA succession of albums followed at GRP where he recorded eight CDs. His stated ambition throughout these endeavors has been \"to try to consistently grow and evolve as a player and broaden my horizons as an artist while endeavoring to make music that people will feel and relate to.\" With his musical armory encompassing flute, piccolo, alto, tenor and soprano saxophone as well as whistling, he was well equipped to fulfill this desire. He has recorded with The Rippingtons, Chuck Loeb, Patti Austin, Tom Browne, and The GRP All Star Big Band to name a few and is featured on Don Grusin's Grammy nominated CD \"The Hang.\" Though Rangell has recorded mostly in the contemporary/pop and smooth jazz formats garnering top radio play and a large audience, The Times of London also notes that \"heard live a much more robust and idiosyncratic player emerges. With his discography of now 17 CD releases Nelson Rangell continues on his musical path with 2 new and unique albums, \"Red\", a collection of dedicated saxophone recordings in the pop jazz and contemporary jazz idiom and \"Blue\" which features the flute and piccolo throughout it's highly diverse 11 tracks.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3049 20th St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Jinx Jones", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.411406, 37.758862], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Atlas Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jinx Jones & Jessica Rose at Atlas Cafe: What's not to love about Atlas Cafe?

Eight years later, the trio of Alex Hwang (guitar/vocals), Daniel Chae (guitar/vocals) and Sally Kang (keys/vocals) have returned to the name \u2014 this time as the title of their upcoming EP, \u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One,\u201d out in May 2019.\n\nA celebratory effort ushering in a new era for the band, after having recently evolved from a sextet to a trio, \u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One\u201d is about finding hope in transition, discovering your voice in a sea of doubt, and deciding to dance despite sadness. \u201cIt\u2019s learning to trust your own voice regardless of whatever's happening outside of you,\u201d Chae says.\nSince the departure of three founding band members in 2016, Run River North have fought to reclaim their identity and their sound. With that came a reckoning: The trio were steadfast on returning to their roots and rebranding again as Monsters Calling Home as a way to separate themselves from the personnel changes. Instead, the EP\u2019s title \u2014 and the music within it \u2014 became the vehicle to move past the anger and hurt feelings. \u201cHaving to go through three breakups, it was a shitty time,\u201d Hwang says. \u201cI just stopped wanting to write songs that were angry. It\u2019s a good emotion to go through but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re left with that\u2019s not a healthy place to be. The songs on the EP are more representative of how do you find hope and how do you find joy even if you have a right to feel angry. How can you find a reason to dance even when everyone is telling you it\u2019s not the right time to dance?\u201d\n\nNot just an Asian-American band or a group that relies on a set sonic formula, the EP continues to expand upon the band\u2019s prior folk-leaning backbone. On lead single \u201cHands Up,\u201d the band is at their most bombastic. The result of a co-writing collaboration with Hannah Hooper and Christian Zucconi of Grouplove \u2014 the duo\u2019s first of such sessions \u2014 \u201cHands Up\u201d pairs an earworm-y chorus with a front-and-center guitar melody, a second voice among Hwang\u2019s lead bellow. Overall, the group utilizes more drum programming, dreamy synth, and dynamic production \u2014 a more expansive sonic palette.\n\n\u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One\u201d is bookended by brother-sister songs \u201cCasina\u201d and \u201cCasino.\u201d A song with roots in the band\u2019s days as a six-piece, \u201cCasino\u201d was written as the group\u2019s former members began to phase out. A wistful and rustic intro builds into a walloping chorus: \u201cI\u2019m stuck in this casino / not much left for me.\u201d It\u2019s a song which serves as catharsis when reckoning with the forces that hold us down, a song inspired by Hwang\u2019s mother\u2019s cancer diagnosis. \u201cAt the time it was this big middle finger to cancer or anything you felt was giving an absolute statement to people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cCasina,\u201d on the other hand, was borne out of a late-night studio session between Chae, Kang and their producer, Miro Markie. Aiming to re-work \u201cCasino,\u201d \u201cthey handed me a microphone and they were like, \u2018Try singing,\u2019\u201d Kang remembers. Her take on the song\u2019s chorus added an air of whimsy balancing Hwang\u2019s belt. The pair ping-pong verses and lines, creating a push-pull of dizzying tension. \u201cI think this may be the first song that we don\u2019t have a lead vocalist in a song,\u201d Chae says. \u201cWhen Sally wrote her part on this song it was the first time we thought this might be something. That\u2019s the moment I can point to that was really exciting for this EP. It\u2019s a linchpin for this EP.\n\nWith the energy of \u201cCasina\u201d \u2014 and Kang finding her voice \u2014 in mind, Run River North move forward as a true collaborative effort unthwarted by ego and pretense. No longer held back by fear or discontent, Run River North persevered through pain and came out on the other side victorious wearing a newfound confidence. \u201cIt became about who is in the band,\u201d Hwang says, \u201cand now it feels like Sally, Daniel, and me being very comfortable in our own skin.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "555 Waverley Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301", "Artist": "Baroque", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6056223.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.159419, 37.446914], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "All Saints Episcopal Church", "moreBioInfo": "When art meets music to impress your soul!", "otherInfo": "With over 30 million YouTube fans worldwide, San Francisco's Voices of Music is the most popular early music ensemble in the United States by a wide margin, and one of the most popular ensembles in any genre of classical music, in the world.

It was inevitable that from the moment of his birth his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as \u201cmusician\u201d on Dweezil\u2019s birth certificate). Dweezil\u2019s early years were spent largely away from the spotlight\u2014something of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family. Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad.It wasn't until he was 12 that he began to show a serious interest in manipulating the instrument to make music. Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father's music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil \u2018s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. To gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father's band at that time, Steve Vai. Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions. Later that year he recorded his first single, \u201cMy Mother Is A Space Cadet\u201d, produced by Edward Van Halen and released on Frank Zappa\u2019s Barking Pumpkin label. In 1984, Dweezil contributed guitar solos to both \u201cStevie\u2019s Spanking\u201d and \u201cSharleena\u201d on Frank\u2019s album Them Or Us. In 1986, Dweezil made his debut in Hollywood as an actor with his role in the classic 80s film \u201cPretty In Pink.\" 1987 saw Dweezil raise his profile further with another film role alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mick Fleetwood in \"The Running Man.\" In television he worked as a guest MTV VJ. During that same period he recorded and released his first full length album, Havin\u2019 A Bad Day. This album contained the single \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d which featured Moon Zappa on vocals and found itself on regular rotation on MTV. The video featured cameo appearances from Frank Zappa, Robert Wagner, Don Johnson and Jane Fonda as well. Around this same time, Dweezil made his own cameo appearances on records for a variety of diverse artists. He played a solo on the Fat Boys \"Baby You're A Rich Man\u201d as well as on the Grammy Nominated cover of \"Wipeout\" with Herbie Hancock and Terry Bozzio from the \"Back To The Beach\" film soundtrack. He was asked to join Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bonnie Raitt in contributing guitar performances to Miami Vice star Don Johnson's solo album. While Dweezil actually played on the song \"The Last Sound Love Makes\" it was his appearance in the video for Don Johnson\u2019s single \u201cHeartbeat\" that would most notably link him to the project. 1988 saw Dweezil sign a deal with Chrysalis Records, releasing his second album My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama. More TV work followed in 1990 Dweezil and Moon Zappa starred with Laverne And Shirley legend Cindy Williams in a sitcom for CBS titled Normal Life. With the release of his third album Confessions in 1991, Dweezil began to branch out musically, blending his heavy rock approach with touches of his father\u2019s distinct compositional insignia. Guest appearances on this album pointed the way toward the future for Dweezil, including contributions from Nuno Bettencourt , Gary Cherone and Pat Badger of Extreme and legendary guitarists Warren DeMartini, Steve Lukather and Zakk Wylde as well as Frank Zappa sidemen Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes. Both Moon and Ahmet Zappa also added vocals to the album. Dweezil conceived and directed 2 videos from the album, 'Gotta Get To You' and 'Vanity' both of which featured Robert Wagner as a guest star. Robert Wagner has appeared in 4 of Dweezil's videos as well as the \"Music For Pets\" infomercial spoof. There were a handful of live shows played to support the Confessions album. That tour saw the band develop a unique set of skills and usher in the birth of a remarkable non stop medley that grew to contain 200 songs performed in 20 minutes. After completing the Confessions tour Dweezil formed a new band and project with Ahmet called Z. Armed with a mountain of material and no permanent drummer the band entered the family owned rehearsal space called Joe's Garage and rehearsed with several different drummers who ended up playing on tracks for the new album. Those drummers included Terry Bozzio, Mark Craney, Toss Panos, and Tal Bergman. Rather than move to a studio they set up for recording rehearsals. The band recorded over 3 dozen tracks at Joe's Garage. The \"Shampoohorn\" album was completed in 1992 but awaited it's release over a year later. It was eventually released with 2 different track listings. The band featured Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes and initiated it's new permanent drummer, Berklee School Of Music-trained drummerpar excellence Joe Travers before departing for a world tour. Thunes departed later in 1994 and was replaced by Bryan Beller who had attended classes at Berklee alongside Joe Travers. The band toured the US and Europe in 1995. They played original material as well as some more oddball medleys including the infamous \"Peavey Medley.\" In 1996 they released a follow-up album, Music For Pets. By the time of the album\u2019s release, both Beller and Keneally had left the band and Z gradually ceased to exist. Dweezil stayed in the public eye however with several projects including composing the theme music for the Emmy Award winning Fox television show \"The Ben Stiller Show\" and on camera TV appearances including taking the role of Ajax in the Klasky Csupo animated series Duckman and a TV series for the USA network called Happy Hour which he starred in alongside Ahmet. 2000 saw Dweezil issue his first solo album since 1991\u2019s Confessions... with the release of Automatic. By this time, Dweezil\u2019s musicianship had come full-circle as he showed off his guitar virtuosity with eclectic all guitar orchestrations of \"You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch\" and \"Hawaii 5-0.\" In 2003 More television work came about as Dweezil formed a band for the WB unconventional improvisational comedy \"On The Spot\" and performed live in each episode. He also composed the theme music for the WB series \"The Jamie Kennedy Experiment\" and composed dozens of tracks for the music library Extreme Music. Many of these track are heard on various television shows around the world. The next several years saw Dweezil preparing to take on an extremely difficult challenge\u2014bringing his father\u2019s legendary music back to the concert stage. In 2006, some indication of what could be expected surfaced with Dweezil\u2019s next solo album Go With What You Know. The Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa band's current 2014 lineup is known as the \"rocking teenage combo.\" Now a 6 piece they are firing on all cylinders propelled by the ryhthm section of Ryan Brown on drums and Kurt Morgan on bass. Boundless energy is contributed by the rest of the line up which includes original core member multi-instrumentalist Sheila Gonzalez, as well as multi-year veterans Chris Norton on keyboards and vocals as well as vocals/brass/miscellaneous from Ben Thomas. Currently Dweezil has developed his online guitar course for students. It's branded as \"DWEEZOLOGY\" and is available here on the DZW site http://www.dweezilzappaworld.com/pages/dweezology as well as on line at truefire.com. He has also participated with the likes of Jazz legends Mike Stern and Lee Ritenour in the top notch Crown Of The Continent guitar festival in Montana. 2014 marked the inaugural Frank Zappa scholarship at the festival. Dweezil plans to return to \"Montana soon...\" to participate and contribute to future COC events. 2015 marked a milestone for Dweezil's Zappa Plays Zappa project. The band has consistently played concerts around the world for the past 10 years. Racking up well over 1,000 shows. In that time Dweezil did not have a time to cultivate his own music. November 27th 2015 marks the release of Dweezil's first new album since \"Go With What You Know\" in 2006. Dweezil Zappa has returned to his musical roots with his new CD release Via Zammata'. Fusing analog tape and tube guitar amps alongside surprising instruments such as fretless guitar and the oud, Zappa draws you into his intimate, and multifarious musical world. Armed with unexpected vocal arrangements that sound like the Beach Boys procreated with the Bulgarian Women's Choir, this collection of 12 uniquely orchestrated songs represents a true metamorphosis for Dweezil Zappa the solo artist. The album was produced and arranged by Dweezil Zappa and features songwriting collaborations with Frank Zappa and venerable actor John Malkovich. Dweezil found himself in the midst of some controversy and family drama after the passing of his Mother. The Zappa Family Trust, now operated by Dweezil's 2 younger siblings, fired off a cease and desist letter to Dweezil. The letter required Dweezil to immediately stop using the name Zappa Plays Zappa. A story about this dispute was printed by the New York Times on April 29, 2016. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/business/media/whats-in-a-name-just-ask-frank-zappas-feuding-heirs.html?_r=0 In response to the letter from the ZFT, Dweezil changed the name of his band to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa and continues to tour playing his father's music for appreciative audiences worldwide. Dweezil\u2019s proudest accomplishments are as father to his two daughters Zola Frank Zappa (born 2006) and Ceylon Indira Zappa (born 2008).

Be it new wave, punk, surf, ska, rockabilly, metal or goth, the trio's self-produced, film-centric third Hellcat album, Kiss Kiss Kill Kill, embraces all of the aforementioned rock & roll subgenres with admirable aplomb. Crafting a thrill ride of an album is no easy feat, but Patricia Day (lead vocals/upright bass), Nekroman (lead guitar/vocals) and Niedermeier (drums/vocals) have done so by adhering to instinct. By staying true to their original and diverse musical vision, HorrorPops have flourished, building a tremendously loyal and ever-growing following in the process. From the charged anthem, \"Missfit\" - replete with an amusing nod to Madness' \"Our House\" that takes the song to unexpected heights - to the adventurously dark title track, Kiss Kiss Kill Kill is both captivating and inspiring. The album's namesake, which elicits memories of The Cure, Siouxsie & the Banshees and - thanks to its deep, sinister harmonies - Sisters of Mercy, is at once an ingenious new tune and an ardent tribute to past icons. While the Denmark-reared, L.A. based HorrorPops' expertly crafted new disc marks a return to the new wave leanings abundant on its widely-cherished 2004 Hell Yeah debut, Kiss Kiss Kill Kill is also a bold song-cycle that balances circle-pit punk and Hot 100 pop with exhilarating results. \"We started HorrorPops so that we could play all styles of music,\" Patricia explains. But after its 2005 rock-based sophomore breakthrough Bring It On!, Day admits, \"We really wanted to get back to the classic new wave feel that we love. And I think our excitement about these songs has made a hell of difference.\" Kiss Kiss Kill Kill finds HorrorPops reverting back to a trio for album number three. Despite the lineup shift, the disc exudes a new level of confidence. It's a point affirmed in the prowess of the ferocious surf instrumental, \"Horrorbeach Part II,\" the shimmering, hook injected \"Everything's Everything\" and the fiery, old school \"Boot To Boot.\" Based on the recent riots in their home city of Copenhagen, the latter is the only song that doesn't fall into the album's film theme. Chronicling HorrorPops rage over the dismantling and ultimate destruction of Youth House - which doubled as one of Copenhagen's finest rock venues and the last place for punks and street kids in Denmark to call home - Patricia says, \"Twenty five years after they enacted the program, there was a change of government that decided that everything weird had to go. So they sold the house to a Christian community who tore it down. Copenhagen has been on fire. And \"Boot To Boot\" is dedicated to our displaced friends.\" A complete about face from the seriousness of \"Boot\" comes in the form of \"Disco\", which is arguably the most amusing moment on Kiss Kiss Kill Kill. A fun, percussion-driven number with the kind of rattling rim-shots not heard since Kings of the Wild Frontier, this rollicking and infectious winner of a tune was not initially based on Bret Michaels asinine VH1 reality series, Rock of Love. However, \"It fits so perfectly with that show, that it wound up being movie/television related anyway,\" Patricia laughs. Equally stellar is the captivating disc-opener, \"Thelma & Louise,\" which gives Kiss Kiss Kill Kill its levitation with an escapist view. And with its perfect flow - all the way through to its explosive, too-good-to-be-missed parting shot \"Private Hall of Shame\" - it would be easy to assume that a lot of time and energy went into the sequencing of the songs for HorrorPops third disc. Of course you know what happens when you assume! \"We barely thought about it,\" Patricia snickers. \"The sequencing just sort of offered itself. Anyone looking at the cover will know the album is mostly about movies - old movies and new movies or music for a movie. In fact the song \"Hitchcock Starlet\" was written to fit almost any Hitchcock movie. It has that kind of vibe.\" But getting back to the aforementioned song that takes its name from that 1991 Susan Sarandon-Geena Davis film where housewives turn hellions, Patricia says, \"I think a lot of people have that feeling, where they just want to leave everything behind, feel freedom and get the fuck away.\" But she adds, \"Luckily, we've all been able - from touring - to make a little more money recently. So we are able to live on a little more than just toilet paper and spaghetti. We've all bought some vintage cars and every once in a while we just get in them and go.\" In fact, its easy to imagine sitting in the passenger side of Nekroman's 1924 Ford-turned-\"coffin on wheels\" cruising the sticky asphalt of Los Angeles with the accompaniment of Kiss Kiss Kill Kill blasting skyward. Of course, Day's '51 MG convertible - which she proudly notes gets an epic 46 miles a gallon - would be a similarly solid choice. With fuel economy like that, to quote Patricia, \"a hybrid can go fuck itself.\" Speaking of hybrids, when the members of HorrorPops hit the road, they still continue to morph from a trio to a quintet. In case you've been under a rock, the band's infamous live spectacle boasts two voluptuous go-go dancers. And Rita-tah and Tweek are new for 2008. \"There is a big difference between the live act and the band,\" Patricia notes. \"So as much time and energy as we put into creating the songs, we also care a lot about the live performance. It's really important for us to put on a show. We take pride in bringing some kind of spectacle to the stage.\" Which explains why, with its heralded live shows and rollicking discography, HorrorPops have successfully earned the adulation of kids throughout the globe and inspired a number of women to front bands. \"It's fucking awesome,\" Day says of the group's following. \"But at the same time it's weird.\" \"As far as bands go, the more women in the music business the better,\" she continues. \"When I started, there were no females, and the other sex didn't want to play with me. We're still at the point where every female vocalist has to be compared to Madonna or Gwen Stefani, simply because they are the only females on the rock charts. So I still feel like there's a lot to prove, and I'm hoping on getting that changed around. Having it so someday gender isn't that important in rock & roll is something that's very important to me.\" On the heels of recent tours with Danzig and Dropkick Murphys, not to mention its Warped triumphs and a full-on stadium tour through Europe with the Offspring on its resume, HorrorPops have proved they can fit in with any number of rock varieties. In respect to their latest album and their history as a band, Patricia acknowledges, \"It feels like we've accomplished what we set out to do, which is crush genres.\" While the core of HorrorPops has remained unchanged and its focus unclouded since it was founded more than a decade ago in Copenhagen, its relocation to L.A. three years ago was the impetus for all that has followed. Looking back, Patricia remarks, \"It's amazing that we've gone from not having a contract to touring stadiums and having a real steady and growing fanbase in just a couple of years. The fact that we've got a loyal following, even though we never asked for it or expected it, it's really been cool.\" And what about the many kids who are so loyal that they've gone ahead and tattooed \"HorrorPops\" on their bodies? \"That scares the shit out of me.\" Day concludes.\" How do you live up to that? That's on their skin forever. I hope we never disappoint them.\" Read mor/thehorrorpops#ixzz10xqbnHes The OFFICIAL Horrorpops Facebook page!", "otherInfo": "HorrorPops"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Lao Tizer", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8061233.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Smooth Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "Driven by an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical , jam band influences and Afro Cuban and world rhythms, Downbeat\u2014the first studio album by TIZER, a multi-cultural band led by Boulder, CO native, keyboardist/composer Lao Tizer\u2014throws down a high powered collection of 12 brand-new originals on this scintillating release of fresh instrumental music from one of today\u2019s rising stars of the world-fusion genre. Establishing themselves in the contemporary jazz world over the past few years, TIZER has spurred comparisons of a modern twist to the 70s and early 80s heyday of jazz fusion, when trailblazing ensembles like Return To Forever, Mahavishnu Orchestra and Weather Report set the aesthetic standard. Truly embodying the title and spirit of his 2007 solo album Diversify, Lao assembled a group of veteran world-class musicians to create a dynamic rich with new melodic, harmonic and improvisational possibilities. Co-produced by Lao and guitarist Jeff Kollman (GlennHughes, UFO, Chad Smith\u2019s Bombastic Meatbats), the eclectic set includes five original compositions by Lao and numerous collaborations with his cohorts, including the first single \u201cWorld In Rhythm,\u201d co-written with Emmy winner and Grammy nominated guitarist Chieli Minucci, best known as founder and leader of Special EFX. Over the past few years, TIZER\u2014a 2011 nominee for \u201cJazz Group of the Year\u201d--has taken their multi-faceted world fusion vibe around the globe, galvanizing thousands at events including the Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta, the Joy of Jazz Festival in Johannesburg, the Dubai Jazz Festival, Barbados Jazz Festival, the Caribbean Sea Jazz Festival and the Festival International Providencia Jazz in Santiago, Chile. In addition to their usual whirlwind of U.S. dates, their 2012 schedule in support of Downbeat includes the Jarasum International Jazz Festival in South Korea and four shows in Russia. While Lao was a \u201cBest New Jazz Artist\u201d nominee in 2002 and Diversify spent many weeks on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz chart, TIZER has a multi-genre, multi-national appeal that expands beyond just jazz enthusiasts. Their diverse resume includes performance slots alongside Zappa Plays Zappa, Jethro Tull, Isaac Hayes, Al Jarreau, Spyro Gyra, George Benson, Soulive, Babyface, Bruce Hornsby and Robin Thicke. Those who haven\u2019t yet experienced TIZER\u2019s intensity, expansive arrangements and exciting soloing in concert got the next best thing with the group\u2019s 2010 debut release TIZER Live, which captured the vibrant interaction of what Lao calls \u201cthe ultimate cultural and musical melting pot\u201d; Italian-American New Yorker Minucci, African American violin great Karen Briggs (Yanni, Stanley Clarke, Chaka Khan) and Cuban born drummer/percussionist Raul Pineda (Michel Camilo, Chucho Valdes), in addition to Kollman, multi-instrumentalist Steve Nieves (Kenny Loggins, Loggins & Messina, Jagno) and Lao himself, who grew up in Boulder, Colorado. Bassist Rufus Philpot, who joined TIZER after that recording, hails from London. The concert recording at the world renowned Musicians Institute in Hollywood was TIZER\u2019s very first live performance as a group; it included fresh interpretations of seven songs from Lao\u2019s earlier recordings, including Diversify and Golden Soul (2001). Downbeat marks the first time that Lao has co-produced one of his albums. Loving the big sound of the band and all the intricacies it has in the live setting inspired his simple concept when it came time to write and record the album. \u201cProducing and mixing with Jeff, my goal was to give listeners a taste of the energy TIZER creates in the live setting, so most of the recording was done live in the studio,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile no solo on disc can capture what happens onstage, we wanted Downbeat to have the same blend and balance via strong, detailed arrangements and studio production.

It was inevitable that from the moment of his birth his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as \u201cmusician\u201d on Dweezil\u2019s birth certificate). Dweezil\u2019s early years were spent largely away from the spotlight\u2014something of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family. Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad.It wasn't until he was 12 that he began to show a serious interest in manipulating the instrument to make music. Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father's music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil \u2018s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. To gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father's band at that time, Steve Vai. Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions. Later that year he recorded his first single, \u201cMy Mother Is A Space Cadet\u201d, produced by Edward Van Halen and released on Frank Zappa\u2019s Barking Pumpkin label. In 1984, Dweezil contributed guitar solos to both \u201cStevie\u2019s Spanking\u201d and \u201cSharleena\u201d on Frank\u2019s album Them Or Us. In 1986, Dweezil made his debut in Hollywood as an actor with his role in the classic 80s film \u201cPretty In Pink.\" 1987 saw Dweezil raise his profile further with another film role alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mick Fleetwood in \"The Running Man.\" In television he worked as a guest MTV VJ. During that same period he recorded and released his first full length album, Havin\u2019 A Bad Day. This album contained the single \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d which featured Moon Zappa on vocals and found itself on regular rotation on MTV. The video featured cameo appearances from Frank Zappa, Robert Wagner, Don Johnson and Jane Fonda as well. Around this same time, Dweezil made his own cameo appearances on records for a variety of diverse artists. He played a solo on the Fat Boys \"Baby You're A Rich Man\u201d as well as on the Grammy Nominated cover of \"Wipeout\" with Herbie Hancock and Terry Bozzio from the \"Back To The Beach\" film soundtrack. He was asked to join Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bonnie Raitt in contributing guitar performances to Miami Vice star Don Johnson's solo album. While Dweezil actually played on the song \"The Last Sound Love Makes\" it was his appearance in the video for Don Johnson\u2019s single \u201cHeartbeat\" that would most notably link him to the project. 1988 saw Dweezil sign a deal with Chrysalis Records, releasing his second album My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama. More TV work followed in 1990 Dweezil and Moon Zappa starred with Laverne And Shirley legend Cindy Williams in a sitcom for CBS titled Normal Life. With the release of his third album Confessions in 1991, Dweezil began to branch out musically, blending his heavy rock approach with touches of his father\u2019s distinct compositional insignia. Guest appearances on this album pointed the way toward the future for Dweezil, including contributions from Nuno Bettencourt , Gary Cherone and Pat Badger of Extreme and legendary guitarists Warren DeMartini, Steve Lukather and Zakk Wylde as well as Frank Zappa sidemen Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes. Both Moon and Ahmet Zappa also added vocals to the album. Dweezil conceived and directed 2 videos from the album, 'Gotta Get To You' and 'Vanity' both of which featured Robert Wagner as a guest star. Robert Wagner has appeared in 4 of Dweezil's videos as well as the \"Music For Pets\" infomercial spoof. There were a handful of live shows played to support the Confessions album. That tour saw the band develop a unique set of skills and usher in the birth of a remarkable non stop medley that grew to contain 200 songs performed in 20 minutes. After completing the Confessions tour Dweezil formed a new band and project with Ahmet called Z. Armed with a mountain of material and no permanent drummer the band entered the family owned rehearsal space called Joe's Garage and rehearsed with several different drummers who ended up playing on tracks for the new album. Those drummers included Terry Bozzio, Mark Craney, Toss Panos, and Tal Bergman. Rather than move to a studio they set up for recording rehearsals. The band recorded over 3 dozen tracks at Joe's Garage. The \"Shampoohorn\" album was completed in 1992 but awaited it's release over a year later. It was eventually released with 2 different track listings. The band featured Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes and initiated it's new permanent drummer, Berklee School Of Music-trained drummerpar excellence Joe Travers before departing for a world tour. Thunes departed later in 1994 and was replaced by Bryan Beller who had attended classes at Berklee alongside Joe Travers. The band toured the US and Europe in 1995. They played original material as well as some more oddball medleys including the infamous \"Peavey Medley.\" In 1996 they released a follow-up album, Music For Pets. By the time of the album\u2019s release, both Beller and Keneally had left the band and Z gradually ceased to exist. Dweezil stayed in the public eye however with several projects including composing the theme music for the Emmy Award winning Fox television show \"The Ben Stiller Show\" and on camera TV appearances including taking the role of Ajax in the Klasky Csupo animated series Duckman and a TV series for the USA network called Happy Hour which he starred in alongside Ahmet. 2000 saw Dweezil issue his first solo album since 1991\u2019s Confessions... with the release of Automatic. By this time, Dweezil\u2019s musicianship had come full-circle as he showed off his guitar virtuosity with eclectic all guitar orchestrations of \"You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch\" and \"Hawaii 5-0.\" In 2003 More television work came about as Dweezil formed a band for the WB unconventional improvisational comedy \"On The Spot\" and performed live in each episode. He also composed the theme music for the WB series \"The Jamie Kennedy Experiment\" and composed dozens of tracks for the music library Extreme Music. Many of these track are heard on various television shows around the world. The next several years saw Dweezil preparing to take on an extremely difficult challenge\u2014bringing his father\u2019s legendary music back to the concert stage. In 2006, some indication of what could be expected surfaced with Dweezil\u2019s next solo album Go With What You Know. The Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa band's current 2014 lineup is known as the \"rocking teenage combo.\" Now a 6 piece they are firing on all cylinders propelled by the ryhthm section of Ryan Brown on drums and Kurt Morgan on bass. Boundless energy is contributed by the rest of the line up which includes original core member multi-instrumentalist Sheila Gonzalez, as well as multi-year veterans Chris Norton on keyboards and vocals as well as vocals/brass/miscellaneous from Ben Thomas. Currently Dweezil has developed his online guitar course for students. It's branded as \"DWEEZOLOGY\" and is available here on the DZW site http://www.dweezilzappaworld.com/pages/dweezology as well as on line at truefire.com. He has also participated with the likes of Jazz legends Mike Stern and Lee Ritenour in the top notch Crown Of The Continent guitar festival in Montana. 2014 marked the inaugural Frank Zappa scholarship at the festival. Dweezil plans to return to \"Montana soon...\" to participate and contribute to future COC events. 2015 marked a milestone for Dweezil's Zappa Plays Zappa project. The band has consistently played concerts around the world for the past 10 years. Racking up well over 1,000 shows. In that time Dweezil did not have a time to cultivate his own music. November 27th 2015 marks the release of Dweezil's first new album since \"Go With What You Know\" in 2006. Dweezil Zappa has returned to his musical roots with his new CD release Via Zammata'. Fusing analog tape and tube guitar amps alongside surprising instruments such as fretless guitar and the oud, Zappa draws you into his intimate, and multifarious musical world. Armed with unexpected vocal arrangements that sound like the Beach Boys procreated with the Bulgarian Women's Choir, this collection of 12 uniquely orchestrated songs represents a true metamorphosis for Dweezil Zappa the solo artist. The album was produced and arranged by Dweezil Zappa and features songwriting collaborations with Frank Zappa and venerable actor John Malkovich. Dweezil found himself in the midst of some controversy and family drama after the passing of his Mother. The Zappa Family Trust, now operated by Dweezil's 2 younger siblings, fired off a cease and desist letter to Dweezil. The letter required Dweezil to immediately stop using the name Zappa Plays Zappa. A story about this dispute was printed by the New York Times on April 29, 2016. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/business/media/whats-in-a-name-just-ask-frank-zappas-feuding-heirs.html?_r=0 In response to the letter from the ZFT, Dweezil changed the name of his band to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa and continues to tour playing his father's music for appreciative audiences worldwide. Dweezil\u2019s proudest accomplishments are as father to his two daughters Zola Frank Zappa (born 2006) and Ceylon Indira Zappa (born 2008).

As Stonefield, they\u2019ve got three albums and thousands of miles under their belts, plus plenty of perspective on what it\u2019s like to fight to make a place for themselves, and tell their own story.\n\nWritten largely on the road in America earlier this year, the songs on BENT are filled with reference and reflection--the kind that comes from months spent far from home, living on four wheels. The surreal isolation of trudging through white-out snow and snaking down deserted highways served as the perfect backdrop for the band to look inward, taking stock of the journey they\u2019ve taken thus far as musicians, and as people. \u201cIt\u2019s a culmination of experiences, emotions,and stories collected over time,\u201d explains lead singer and drummer Amy Findlay, \u201cA growth of honest, raw, energy that has been burning within us and waiting for its moment.\n\n\u201dRecorded in just five days with Joe Walker and Stu Mackenzie from King Gizzard at their studio in Melbourne, the album is almost 100% live. Besides being an impressive feat and the flexing of a confident band operating at the height of their powers, that immediacy lends the album a distinct, crackling energy--thunder, lightning, and muscle-bound horsepower. \u201cSleep\u201d opens the album with guitars covered in five inches of sludge and distortion and something that sounds like a far-off siren, or the high-pitched howling of the wind. It serves as a warning, a call to arms,kicking things off with a next-level version of the massive, unholy racket the band has become known for over the course of their last three albums.\n\nThe sonic inspiration taken from listening to Black Sabbath, Beak, Deep Purple, The Alan Parsons Project, and Mike Oldfield inject BENT with its sternum-shaking heaviness and ever-present swagger, but also its exploratory fearlessness--letting the songs loose to twist and turn, sticking to no one\u2019s rules but their own. Take the proggy, keyboard-soaked intro at the top of \u201cPeople,\u201d or the cheeky combination of tinnitus-inducing hard rock and hip-shaking boogie at thecore of \u201cDead Alive.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t make me think I\u2019ve lost control / I know exactly what you said / Don\u2019tmake me think it\u2019s in my head,\u201d Amy sings during the latter, keeping the lyrics as defiant as the music.\n\n\u201cThe album is about our own experiences and stories,\u201d explains Amy, \u201cSongs about the fear of walking home alone at night, stories of what it\u2019s like being an all-female band and the power of supporting one another.\" With that being the lyrical subject, the music that came out is definitely our heaviest.\u201d It\u2019s clear that darker thoughts were on the Findlay sisters\u2019 mind-- \u201cRoute 29,\u201d with its suspenseful synth intro was inspired by the creepy The Route 29 Stalker podcast the band was listening to as they drove the namesake road on their way to a gig with King Tuff, and the cascading synth line and slinky restraint of the hi-hat on \u201cIf I Die\u201d can only distract so much from the song\u2019s terror-stricken lyrics.\n\nIt\u2019s on the album\u2019s last two songs that the band makes their strongest statement, using \u201cShutdown\u201d to explore the doubt and search for validation that comes from moving and working within an industry that often makes the band feel like outsiders, lacing lines like \u201cIs it easy for you living / When you don\u2019t have to prove your meaning\u201d in between a battle-cry chorus and detonations of guitar and keyboard. And \u201cWoman\u201d takes it to the edge with a chorus of \u201cI am enough / I am woman,\u201d spelling it out for anyone that hasn\u2019t been paying attention.\n\nBENT has all the chills and spills you would expect from an album that mines inspiration from some of the darker experiences of being misrepresented, belittled, and underestimated. By taking control of the narrative, and pumping it up with stack-blowing, guitar hero riffs and razor-edged vocals, it becomes an album of power, control, and confidence--projected in the face of a world that too often forces the opposite.\n\nStonefield are:\nAmy Findlay: Drums/Vocals\nHannah Findlay: Guitar\nSarah Findlay: Keys\nHolly Findlay: Bass", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Maoli", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10071155.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Island, Reggae", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "Maoli (meaning \u201cNative\u201d in Hawaiian) started in Maui with Glenn Awong, a 14 year-old with a passion for music, and Kana Akiu-Corpuz.

Initially known for air-punching, dancefloor dismantling drum & bass, Sub Focus has now become synonymous with music that draws from all corners of the electronic landscape, and has come to epitomise the \u2018anything goes\u2019 mantra of todays flourishing dance scene. London born and bred, Douwma\u2019s rise into the furthest reaches of the dance music stratosphere began when he first encountered jungle, at high school in the mid-Nineties. A friend played him a cassette featuring General Levy\u2019s hit \u2018Incredible\u2019 and Douwma, at that point playing bass in a rock band, was completely taken under it\u2019s spell. Shortly after this first introduction, The Prodigy - who were beginning to meld rock and dance music in new and exciting ways - also became a massive influence and the young Sub Focus began to lose interest in his studies and started spending more and more time in his bedroom in Holloway, creating music. His ascent turned onto a steep axis, when in 2003, he signed his first tunes to d&b\u2019s biggest label Ram Records, off the back of a CD:R handed to label boss Andy C by one of his friends whilst drunk. Despite this inauspicious introduction, so impressed was the legendary DJ by the music on it, he duly signed every track and invited Douwma to join the Ram family. Sub Focus\u2019 tunes - expansive, fiercely creative, but made with the scientific precision of a military warhead - immediately stood out from the crowd and were soon being rotated by every major DJ in the scene, garnering airplay on mainstream radio, and drawing fans from throughout the globe. Singles like \u2018Airplane\u2019, \u2018X-Ray\u2019 (which reached number 60 in the national charts) and an all-conquering remix of The Prodigy\u2019s \u2018Smack My Bitch Up\u2019 meant that by 2007, Douwma was one of the biggest names in drum & bass. The next logical step was an album. But as he\u2019s shown throughout his short career already, Douwma wanted to push himself further and create something that was more encompassing than the often insular confines of drum & bass. Drawing on his love of all strains of dance music, from 80s synth pioneers Vangelis and Jean Michel Jarre, through dance leviathans The Chemical Brothers, to futuristic house and techno acts like Lindstrom and Matthew Dear, his eponymous debut album released in 2009 featured not only drum & bass but dubstep, old school breakbeat, bumping house and lashings of electro and rock, all brought together in a taut collection that could only have been made in the 21st century. It was an instant hit. The monstrous, Daft Punk-influenced album opener and first single \u2018Rock It\u2019 broke into the Top 40, with second single \u2018Could This Be Real\u2019 doing similar damage. The stunning 'Splash', featuring the vocals of Coco Sumner soon followed, and due to insatiable demand Douwma was called in to remix the likes of Deadmau5, Empire of the Sun and Dizzee Rascal by the end of 2009. The walls and boundaries that once separated the different areas of dance music for so long have seemingly disappeared in the Noughties, destroyed by a new generation of clubbers and producers who are creating and consuming music in a completely different way. Sub Focus\u2019 sound is the perfect reflection of this, with all categories of electronic beats brought together into a luminous, cosmic melting pot. He recently co-wrote and produced the track 'Kickstarts' for UK solo artist Example, which peaked at number 3 in the national charts, and he has also transferred his debut album into a stunning live show, playing festivals throughout the world, joining Pendulum on tour, and in 2010 wowing the revellers at Glastonbury. The unforgettable show on the Glade stage was in many ways a conclusion to the first chapter in Sub Focus' story. He has conquered drum & bass, created a ground-breaking, era-defining album, and has brought new school dance music further into the mainstream spotlight thanks to his unmissable live show. Douwma is already hard at work creating his sophomore long player, and given his track record thus far, it may well revolutionize dance music all over again. But then, would you expect anything less?

In December of that year, Jordan \"HOSS\" Hoss brought his \"Tattooed Crooner\" act to the group, adding more vocal arrangements, and range, previously unobtainable by DeTie. After a string of shows, opening for the likes of the Reverend Horton Heat, the Toasters, and New Cold War, the band decided to reluctantly persuade Ryan \"Arpee Sampson III\" Sampson to move from the landlocked paradise of Boise, Idaho, to Las Vegas, in September of 2014. This addition brought a third harmony, and mediocre guitar playing, that has enticed the fans to walk out the door to this day. Their combination of Ska, Punk, and songs of yesteryear has been enough to make \"Old Blue Eyes\" turn grey. In October of 2015, they released \"How Did You All Get In My Room\", on Squidhat Records, to mild reviews.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2300 Bancroft, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "France", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.263219, 37.867739], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Glam Metal, Rock, Hard Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "St. Mark's Parish", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "'Another Millenium: Circa 1700 in Germany and France' Carla Moore, violin; Elisabeth Reed, gamba; Katherine Heater, harpsichord: a Valentine's Day program of sultry trio sonatas from France and Germany."}, {"Address": "99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "MitiS", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8594497.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.417316, 37.778083], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Dubstep, Electronic, Drum&bass, Chillwave, Electro, Drumstep, House", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "MitiS has been perfecting his special breed of piano-driven melodic bass since 2010.

Over the past two decades they have evolved into what The Guardian called \u201cone of the world\u2019s finest Afrobeat bands\u201d while enjoying equal renown for their cross-genre collaborations with legends of popular music. With a heavy balance of experience and new blood, the group leaps into 2020 with their new Daptone Records full-length \u201cFu Chronicles.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1998 by saxophonist Mart\u00edn Perna, early incarnations of the group included several members of The Dap-Kings including bassist / producer Gabriel Roth, guitarist Binky Griptite, keyboardist Victor Axelrod, conguero Fernando \u201cBugaloo Velez,\u201d and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi. As the group expanded, it absorbed younger musicians from the Daptone family including bassist Nick Movshon (El Michels, Black Keys) and other musical natives and transplants from downtown Manhattan and North Brooklyn music scenes.\n\nIn 1999, Perna and Roth dropped in at an atelier / dojo belonging to Duke Amayo. They invited him to a neighborhood concert and then reached out to him later as an emergency substitute for a show. Amayo soon became a fixture in the group, first on percussion, then later on vocals, vibraphone, and keyboards and moving to center stage as the group\u2019s frontman and creating the Afro-Spot, the band\u2019s headquarters as well as the home of the first Daptone Records studio.\n\nOver the next few years, the band performed several times a month throughout NYC at the Afro-Spot, at benefits, lofts, block parties, and at their Lower Manhattan weekly residency called \u201cAfricalia\u201d with regular appearances by friends including Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and The Sugarman Three. After their second release, \u201cTalkatif\u201d (2002, Ninja Tune), the group began touring heavily throughout North America and Europe including performances at Glastonbury, Montreux Jazz Festival, Coachella, Bonnaroo, and the Newport Jazz Festival. Over the years, expanded their travels to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South America, and most recently, Hong Kong.\n\nIn the late 2000s, after nearly ten years of road touring, Antibalas was chosen by choreographer Bill T Jones, to serve as the band for the Tony-award winning Broadway musical \u201cFela.\u201d Around the same time, the band began to draw the attention of the Roots. The two groups joined with Public Enemy to perform a live version of the entire \u201cIt Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back\u201d at the 2009 Roots Picnic as well as the Red Bull Battle of the Bands, as well as numerous guest appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\n\n\nAntibalas has also served as the house band for several star-studded tribute shows at Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theater paying tribute to the music of Aretha Franklin, David Byrne, Paul Simon, and Billie Holiday, backing dozens including Allen Toussaint, Cee Lo Green, Sharon Jones, Santigold, and Angelique Kidjo.\n\nOver the years, different members have traded production and composition duties from album to album. On the new album\u2014\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d\u2014Amayo leads us through a thrilling sonic journey of kung fu meets Afrobeat, weaving together the strands of Edo and Yoruba cultural memory from Nigeria with his training and study in Chinese martial arts.\n\nRecorded in the Summer of 2018, over seventeen musicians and singers crammed into the storied Daptone House of Soul in Bushwick to record the massive body of work. With live versions and arrangements stretching up to thirty minutes, Perna, Amayo, and Roth worked tirelessly to preserve the hypnotic power of the long-form live arrangements into six concise and powerful album tracks.\n\n\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d will be the eighth studio album from Antibalas, who have been releasing music over four decades; Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1 (1999), Talkatif (2002), Who Is This America?

He is equally at home playing with jazz veteran Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish sean-n\u00f3s singer Roisin El Safty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata. And at heart, he is a jazz improviser.\n\nTurrisi, it\u2019s safe to say, is a musical polyglot par excellence and it\u2019s natural that he feels at home in multiple musical settings for his vocabulary is a colorful weave of early music, pan-Mediterranean modal melodies and European flavored jazz.\n\nIn spite of his numerous collaborations it\u2019s as a leader that Turrisi has earned his spurs. His four beautifully crafted solo albums and two co-led releases have garnered widespread critical acclaim.\nFor Turrisi, tradition and improvisation are not different countries but two sides of the same mountain. Turrisi\u2019s musical traditions - formal and folkloric - span the centuries and a large swathe of the history of European migration. This kaleidoscopic vocabulary - always in flux - provides the grist to Turrisi\u2019s improvisational mill and the rough material from which he crafts his uniquely original, haunting music.\nHis ability to rework ancient melodies and rhythms through a contemporary jazz prism marks him out as one of the most striking voices to have emerged on the European jazz scene in the past decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Matt Jaffe", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8945081.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Indie Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "Matt Jaffe is a 24 year old rock & roll singer/songwriter from San Francisco.

They became a very well-known and popular band in the Bay area in the mid-sixties. At first they played mainly r&b, but later started to add Latin music to the mix.\n\n\nThree or four years into the career of the Malibus, a guitarist was brought in by the name of Jorge Santana, the brother of the already famous Carlos Santana. In 1970 the Malibus changed their name to Malo and things started happening. At times numbering as many as ten or more musicians, Malo's powerful sound was different to that of Santana in that the line-up included a serious horn section, which included, at various times, leading trumpet player Luis Gasca, as well as percussionists Coke Escovedo, Francisco Aguabella, Victor Pantoja and Richard Bean (of Sapo fame).\n\n\nThey were signed to Warner Brothers Records and recorded their first album, which was simply entitled \"Malo\" (BS-2584). Arcelio co-wrote four of the six songs, including their classics \"Nena\" and \"Cafe.\" Released in 1972, \"Malo\" also included \u201cSuavecito,\" which had evolved from a song they had written and been doing in clubs called \u201cMy Love.\u201d\n\n\nOne of the band members at the time, Richard Bean, wrote a new lyric which gave birth to a major hit record. Malo members Pablo Tellez and Abel Zarate also got credit for the composition.\n\n\nWarner Brothers released Malo's second album, \"Dos\" in 1972, followed by \"Evolution\" in 1973. Illness kept Arcelio Garcia out of the group for a year in 74-75. This was the period when Little Willie G., formerly of Thee Midniters of East L.A., came in and became lead singer for Malo. Willie did one album entitled \u201cAscenci\u00f3n\u201d and toured with the band. This album was Malo's last with Warner Brothers.\n\n\nBack in good health, Arcelio, who owns the Malo name and logo, moved to New York and started Malo anew. This resulted in the release of Malo V in 1981. Arcelio then came back to the West Coast, where he has been based ever since.\n\n\nMalo's current lineup includes:\n\nArcelio Garcia, lead vocals; Ramiro Amador, bass; David George, drums; Gabriel Manzo, lead guitar; Jay Rossette, 2nd lead guitar; Daniel Cervantes, keyboards; Frank Bailey, lead trumpet; Pete Rodriguez, trumpet, trombone; Jack Musgrove trumpet, flogahorn; and Tony Menjivar, congas / timbales. Another addition to the current Malo is Arcelio\u2019s son, Octaviano, an excellent singer and performer in his own right.\nSite Designed by Skipnosis Studios", "otherInfo": "Gold Circle / VIP: VIP bag includes an Event poster, VIP Laminate and Lanyard, and a Love Jam T-Shirt to be picked up on the concourse the night of the show. **Scheduled to perform: Midnight Star, Rose Royce, Heatwave, Color Me Badd, Ready For The World, Club Nouveau, Evelyn \"Champagne\" King, Malo, Ray Goodman & Brown, and The Moments Artists subject to change."}, {"Address": "525 W Santa Clara St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Rose Royce", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8668315.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.903104, 37.33276], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, Disco, R&b/soul, Funk, Soul", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SAP Center At San Jose", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Gold Circle / VIP: VIP bag includes an Event poster, VIP Laminate and Lanyard, and a Love Jam T-Shirt to be picked up on the concourse the night of the show. **Scheduled to perform: Midnight Star, Rose Royce, Heatwave, Color Me Badd, Ready For The World, Club Nouveau, Evelyn \"Champagne\" King, Malo, Ray Goodman & Brown, and The Moments Artists subject to change."}, {"Address": "525 W Santa Clara St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Club Nouveau", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.903104, 37.33276], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: 80s, Decades", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SAP Center At San Jose", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Gold Circle / VIP: VIP bag includes an Event poster, VIP Laminate and Lanyard, and a Love Jam T-Shirt to be picked up on the concourse the night of the show. **Scheduled to perform: Midnight Star, Rose Royce, Heatwave, Color Me Badd, Ready For The World, Club Nouveau, Evelyn \"Champagne\" King, Malo, Ray Goodman & Brown, and The Moments Artists subject to change."}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Glitter Wizard", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6034315.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Stoner Metal, Hard Rock, Punk, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "Lipstick stains on the rim of a bong", "otherInfo": "Panache's Valentine's Day Village of Love Planned Parenthood Benefit Show\n8 pm doors\n$20 adv / $25 doors\nall ages"}, {"Address": "13160 CA-9, Boulder Creek, CA 95006", "Artist": "The Keller Sisters", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8632760.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.121327, 37.124938], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk Rock, Blues, Roots, Folk -, Singer, Songwriter, story teller", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "lille \u00e6ske", "moreBioInfo": "Sheryl and Kerry grew up in San Francisco and started singing together at an early age performing in glee clubs, choirs and musical theater.\n\nDaughters of film and theater performer \" Eileen Christy \" the summers were spent on the road learning from the best .

Six virtuosic voices united in crystal clear harmony, against a backdrop of syncopated rhythms, innovative arrangements, and funky grooves that bubble into an intoxicating brew of gospel, jazz, R&B, and pop. With praise from such luminaries as Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Brian Wilson, Ella Fitzgerald and Whitney Houston, the multi-platinum selling sextet has toured across the globe, collaborated across genres, and is recognized as the pre-eminent a capella group in the world.\n\n\n\nWith the popularity of televised vocal competitions such as the explosive a cappella show The Sing Off and the mania over singing driven comedy-dramas like Glee and Smash, Take 6 is the original torchbearer. Two major recent events reminded everyone of this as Take 6 triumphed among a gathering of stars including Celine Dion, Lionel Richie, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Nicks, Ne-Yo, and more. At Walmart's 50th Anniversary celebration, Take 6 captivated the audience with their rendition of the Louis Armstrong hit, What A Wonderful World. Showing the global reach of this phenomenal group, Take 6 closed the show with Ladysmith Black Mambazo to a standing ovation! Two weeks later at the behest of legendary Producer Phil Ramone, Take 6 thrilled a sold-out audience at the Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards performing with and honoring legendary singer-songwriter Ben E. King on his classic \"Stand By Me.\" As a group that knows no musical bounds, they then brought the house down with their tribute to folk icon Woody Guthrie with This Land Is Your Land.\n\n\n\nTake 6 has come a long way from their days at Huntsville, Alabama's Oakwood College where McKnight formed the group as The Gentleman's Estate Quartet in 1980. When tenor Mark Kibble heard the group rehearsing in the dorm bathroom, he joined in the harmonies and performed on stage that night. When Mervyn Warren joined shortly afterward, they took the name Alliance. Yet, when they signed to Reprise Records/Warner Bros. in 1987, they found that there was another group with the same name, so they became Take 6. Says McKnight: \"Take 6 was all about a democratic process of sitting in a room together and throwing a couple of hundred names at each other and Take 6 was the one that got the most yay votes [laughing.] It pretty much was a play on the Take 5 jazz standard and the fact that there are six of us in the group, so it became Take 6.\" Their self-titled debut CD won over jazz and pop critics, scored two 1988 Grammy Awards, landed in the Top Ten Billboard Contemporary Jazz and Contemporary Christian Charts, and they've never slowed down.\n\n\n\nWhat makes the music and the group last this long? The answers are direct and simple: faith, friendship, respect, and love of music. Such qualities garnered them awards beyond musical category - a Soul Train Award and two NAACP Image Award nominations. From their exceptional live performances to their recordings, these qualities remain at the heart of the Take 6 phenomenon.\n\n\n\nOne, Take 6's recent recording on Shanachie, is notable for three reasons. First, it's the group's return to their spiritual heritage. Second, it is their first project without Cedric Dent, who retired from full-time touring with the group last year. \"Cedric had taken a position with MTSU (Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, TN) which didn't allow him to go out on the road during the school year and kind of limited him only to the weekends and that's if it worked for the schedule,\" says Kibble. \"So we decided it was best to find a person to step in and cover him when he couldn't be there. Third, it introduces Khristian Dentley as a full-time permanent member of Take 6. Kibble continues, \"We actually had a pool of three people we used over the years. Khristian was one of those people called on to step in. He did it beautifully and had a lot of energy. In standing in for Cedric, we were able to learn his personality and he was able to learn the music. After 7 years, Cedric decided to go full time into academia and when he did, Khristian was already primed to step in behind him.\"\n\n\n\nAs Take 6 celebrates their 25th Anniversary with a brand new show, they'll share the memories in the music of the past 25 years as well as reveal what the future holds!\n\n\n\nFor more information visit: http://www.take6.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2400 1st St, Livermore, CA 94551", "Artist": "Nnenna Freelon", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7250673.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.768321, 37.683395], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bankhead Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Six-time GRAMMY\u00ae Award-nominee Nnenna Freelon has earned a well-deserved reputation as a compelling and captivating live performer.

At the 43rd annual GRAMMY Awards telecast from Los Angeles, she inspired an enthusiastic standing ovation from 20,000 music-industry insiders and celebrities when she took to the stage. Prior to that stirring appearance, Freelon\u2019s performances for the legendary Julie Andrews at the Society of Singers\u2019 \u201cElla Awards,\u201d Variety\u2019s The Children\u2019s Charity (as a featured vocalist at the Stephen Sondheim Tribute at Carnegie Hall), Jerry Lewis\u2019 Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy Telethon and at the most famous jazz festivals around the globe have all been rousing successes. No wonder\u2014for anyone who has heard and seen Freelon sing knows she is a skillful interpreter of even the most familiar chestnuts. Concord Records released two Freelon-centered recordings in 2008, the first entitled \u201cBetter Than Anything: The Quintessential Nnenna Freelon\u201d celebrating her ever-expanding appeal and artistry; and the second recording \u201cThe Monterey Jazz Festival 50th Anniversary All Stars,\u201d featuring Freelon in spectacular duets and group performances with Terrence Blanchard and James Moody. On her Grammy-nominated (for Best Jazz Vocal Performance) release, \u201cBlueprint Of A Lady: Sketches of Billie Holiday\u201d (2005), Freelon paid tribute to the quintessential jazz vocalist Billie Holiday. As inventive as ever, Freelon turned these Holiday-associated songs and fulfilled Billie Holiday\u2019s message to all artists: \u201cNo two people on earth are alike, and it\u2019s got to be that way with music or it isn\u2019t music.\u201d With her own band, and with Ronald K. Brown & his dance troupe EVIDENCE, Freelon turned this into a multi-media music and dance offering unlike any show previously seen! Freelon is a winner of both the Billie Holiday Award from the prestigious Academie du Jazz and the Eubie Blake Award from the Cultural Crossroads Center in New York City. Born and raised in Cambridge, MA, educated in Boston at Simmons College, Freelon grew up on the sounds of music in the church and of jazz, especially big band music, courtesy of her father. Recently Freelon has teamed up with the World Famous Count Basie Orchestra, creating new music, new arrangements, and a new standard of big band vocalizing founded on musical genius, sensitive melodic renderings, and powerhouse swing. Freelon tips her hat to the fantastic vocalists who have performed with the orchestra, including Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn, adding to the scintillating Basie sounds in the new material designed and arranged for her unique style. Freelon is renowned leader in the education and healthcare fields, has served as National Spokesperson for Partners in Education, and conducts workshops, clinics, and master classes. Her workshops, from \u201cSound Sculpture\u201d to the groundbreaking \u201cBabysong,\u201d teach adults and children that you too can change the world \u2013 even one person at a time \u2013 but it takes dedication and perseverance, the substance of Freelon\u2019s educational activities. The messages in Freelon\u2019s activities go far beyond technique; they reach into the very soul of the person listening and encourage, in fact motivate, them toward constructive change and the creation of positive energy. \"Be sure to check out Nnenna Freelon... very hip music\" - Aretha Franklin", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "The Emo Night Tour", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8936443.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Imagine going to a show and hearing Taking Back Sunday, Fall Out Boy, Panic!

Rachel\u2019s rich, nuanced vocal delivery and Thu\u2019s dynamic guitar arrangements provide the backbone for the duo\u2019s eclectic and heartfelt songs that tell emotionally honest and compelling stories.\n\nTheir identities as mixed-race-Mexican-American and first-generation-Vietnamese-American (respectively) subtly inform the inclusionary, modernist perspective of their lyrics, which provide \u201csmart commentary on social attitudes\u201d (Pasadena Weekly), while their music and melodies cut across decades of classic American song forms, bending and blending genres to produce a unique sound with a fresh, clever and distinct approach to the classic traditions of American jazz, folk and blues.\n\nAfter meeting in 2006, the California-based duo began writing and performing music together. Over the course of two years, as their songwriting developed, they began to incorporate influences from different eras of jazz and pop music, which led to the creation of their unique, vibrant, \u201csophisticated but playful\u201d sound (BuzzBands LA). \u201cHis guitar shimmies and swings like Django Reinhardt while her voice wraps around each note, swaying in unison like a modern-day Ella Fitzgerald.\u201d (Nooga). And while their music hints at these vintage styles, the writing remains modern and relevant - \u201ca breath of musical fresh air\u201d (Playback: STL)\n\nIn 2012, the duo won the West Coast Songwriters International Song Contest in the Miscellaneous category for their original recording, The Art of Missing You \u2013 \u201c\u2026a delightfully poised and melancholic classic jazz ballad that Sarah Vaughan or Billie Holiday would have gladly wrapped their wounded souls around.\u201d (Americana-UK)\n\nIn 2014, The Singer and The Songwriter released their critically acclaimed, debut full-length LP, What a Difference a Melody Makes, produced by Charlie Stavish (Ryan Adams, Jenny Lewis) with mixing and mastering by Brooklyn collective, Mason Jar Music (Lucius, Feist and Andrew Bird). Debuting at #34 on the CMJ Jazz Top 40 Charts, the album has been critically praised as \u201cdiverse, confident, stylish and accomplished\u201d (Americana-UK), \u201ca revelation\u201d (Pittsburgh In Tune) and \u201can opus worthy of national attention\u201d (Playback: STL).\n\nIn March 2016, The Singer and The Songwriter released their sophomore EP, Ballads for Trying Times, produced by Griffin Rodriguez (Beirut). This latest release is being praised as \u201ca delectable listen, an emotional journey down a sullen, yet hopeful trail. Garcia and Tran bring together songs that appear written just for the listener, and no one else.\u201d (Playback: STL). The songs on the EP are described as \u201cbaroque lullabies that move along with an ease and fluidity that showcases their musical maturity and sensibility.\u201d (The Deli LA) The deeply personal record highlights the duo\u2019s strengths as writers and performers: \u201cGarcia's rich, warm voice wraps around you like the softest quilt and Tran's subdued guitar shines at all the right moments, creating somber tracks that are more than palatable and necessary.\u201d (Bitch Media)\n\nIn October 2017, the duo released their third collection of songs, DIRECTIONS. The Huffington Post says the album \"radiates gorgeously contagious melodies, palpitating rhythms and luscious harmonies and, of course, Garcia\u2019s unparalleled voice.\" In February 2018, the song, \"Give Love\" was nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Song at the 16th Annual Independent Music Awards. The duo is currently touring nationally. Of their performance at the 2018 Kansas City Folk Festival, Playlist Play writes: \"The duo creates soft melodic songs, that could just as easily exist as poems. Beautiful and full of soul and emotion, the quaint pair swept the audience away; first time listeners and long-term fans.\"\n\nIn October 2019, the duo partnered with High Plains Public Radio for the HPPR Music Ambassador Tour, a multi-city listening room tour, aiming to bring high-quality live music to the small towns and rural communities in the high plains region of the US. The HPPR Ambassador program increases community exposure to the arts and, through these intimate performances, provides these audiences with access to world-class musicians.\n\nThe duo is currently writing and recording their next full-length studio album, Dreams!

Anything more formulaic would quickly dispel the free spirit embodied in the music.\n\nPrecision is king with DSO, which position the stage plot based on the year of Grateful Dead show to be performed, adapting phrasing, voice arrangements, and even arranges specific musical equipment for the various eras of Dead music performed.

Continuously performing shows and withholding a heavy appearance schedule, Tritt is proving to be unstoppable.\n\nThe highly abbreviated Tritt timeline started when the young Marietta, Georgia native incorporated his lifelong influences of Southern rock, blues and gospel into his country during a honky-tonk apprenticeship that led him to Warner Bros. in 1989. Over the course of a decade, Travis released seven studio albums and a greatest hits package for the label. His 1990 debut Country Club and its succession of hits put him in the vanguard of the genre's early '90s boom, dubbing him as one of \u201cThe Class of \u201889,\u201d which included country music superstars Garth Brooks, Clint Black and Alan Jackson; all whom dominated the charts in the early \u201890s.\n\n\u201cCountry Club,\u201d \u201cHelp Me Hold On,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Somebody,\u201d and \u201cDrift Off to Dream\u201d peaked at numbers two and three on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts; all which led for Tritt to win Top New Male Artist award from Billboard and the CMA Horizon Award (now known as the New Artist Award). Additionally, in 1991, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) marked Tritt\u2019s debut album Country Club as certified platinum.\n\nTwo years after his debut, Travis\u2019 sophomore album, It\u2019s All About to Change, was released. Literally speaking, this album changed everything when the album shipped three million copies and all four of its singles reached the top five on the country music charts. Along with his first album, this release became triple-platinum certified by the RIAA.\n\nAt the same time, his conspicuous lack of a cowboy hat and musical assertiveness set him apart. The next series of albums, seven of which are certified platinum or higher, scored him more hit singles and led him to amass more than 30 million in career album sales, two Grammys, three CMA Awards and a devoted fan base that has filled venues coast-to-coast.\n\nHe's been a force in sports appearances, having performed at the 1996 Olympics, two Super Bowls, a World Series Game, the opening of the Georgia Dome, the final Braves game at Atlanta-Fulton Country Stadium and, in 2013, the NCAA men's basketball championship.\n\nIn 2012, Tritt formed his own label, Post Oak Recordings and shortly after released his album, The Calm After... Most recently, Tritt released a new project, a special live 2-disc CD and DVD, titled A Man and His Guitar \u2013 Live From The Franklin Theatre. The release, shot and recorded at the historic Franklin Theatre in Franklin, Tenn., spotlights Tritt\u2019s distinctively soulful voice and his exceptional guitar prowess in an intimate theater setting.\n\nIn late 2014 and throughout 2015, Tritt's compilation album, Very Best of Travis Tritt, that was originally released in 2007, saw a sales resurgence as it topped the SoundScan Top 200 Catalog Country Albums chart for over 60 consecutive weeks with 15 weeks spent at No. 1 and 35+ weeks notched in a Top 5 position, while earning RIAA certified gold status by selling over 500,000 copies. The 20-track album features some of Tritt\u2019s biggest hits, including \u201cIt\u2019s A Great Day To Be Alive,\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s A Quarter,\u201d and \u201cAnymore.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Travis Tritt, visit his website TravisTritt.com and follow him on and Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.", "otherInfo": "Travis Tritt\nPre-sale code is TRITT"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "C.W.

Case in point: power-packed R&B as delivered by soulful singer/songwriter Avant. The masterful crooner is back on point with his seventh album, Face the Music (Feb. 5, 2013). Inspired by the R&B legends\u2014Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Frankie Beverly & Maze, Luther Vandross and Kenny \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds\u2014who have been guiding lights in Avant\u2019s career, the project marks the singer\u2019s first release on the Capitol/EMI-distributed independent label Mo-B. But the set does more than just pay homage to R&B masters. Thanks to Avant\u2019s inventiveness, Face the Music cooks up a tantalizing blend of contemporary and traditional sounds. \u201cIt\u2019s a taste of new school and old school,\u201d explains Avant. \u201cYou might hear a piece of, say, Stevie Wonder or Babyface, then I spin right back around and offer up some new age R&B. It\u2019s a well-rounded album with something for everyone. At the end of the day, Face the Music is about who we are and what we live by; it\u2019s about respecting that as well as the music.\u201d Jumpstarting the buzz about the forthcoming album is lead single \u201cYou & I,\u201d Avant\u2019s long-anticipated reunion with duet partner Keke Wyatt. Already a top 10 hit on Billboard\u2019s Adult R&B chart and currently climbing the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs tally, the searing love ballad revisits the natural magic Avant and Wyatt conjured on their first hit together, \u201cMy First Love.\u201d \u201cKeke was only 16 when we did \u2018My First Love,\u2019\u201d recalls Avant. \u201cI\u2019d never heard a voice like that coming from someone so young. She still possesses that same amazing spirit and soul when she sings.\u201d Avant traveled to Chicago to record Face the Music, writing every song on the 12-track set. Production collaborators included Grammy Award-winning duo Tim & Bob (Boyz II Men, TLC, Bobby V), who contributed three songs, and the trio Monopoly. The latter is comprised of Avant, Dre Hen and Kajun. Kajun, a promising newcomer signed to the L.A. Reid Music Publishing Company, produced the Ludacris hit, \u201cSex Room.\u201d In addition to hit single \u201cYou & I,\u201d Face the Music\u2019s highlights include the mid-tempo charmer \u201cBest Friend\u201d and the passion-filled \u201cMore.\u201d Another standout, \u201cWish That I Could Love You,\u201d skillfully lays out the dilemma between settling down with a significant other and still wanting to play the field. It\u2019s this skill set\u2014the ability to turn real-life situations into melodic short stories, made memorable by Avant\u2019s nuanced tenor\u2014that gives the singer his distinctive edge. \u201cI grew up on the Babyfaces and the Luthers; they made me who I am,\u201d says Avant. \u201cI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a blueprint to music, but there are certain things you have to stick by. Melody comes first for me then the story. The trick is to find a different way to tell a story every time so it feels new.\u201d Like many R&B singers, Avant got his start singing in the church choir. After attending Cleveland School of the Arts, he became the first act signed to NBA legend Magic Johnson\u2019s MCA-distributed label, Magic Johnson Music (MJM). Avant\u2019s 2000 MJM debut album, My Thoughts, spun off the Billboard No. 1 R&B hit \u201cSeparated.\u201d That was followed by the top five hit \u201cMy First Love,\u201d a cover of the 1983 Ren\u00e9 & Angela classic featuring Wyatt. Avant returned the favor on Wyatt\u2019s 2001 album debut, Soul Sista, pairing with her on the No. 4 hit \u201cNothing in This World.\u201d After scoring platinum with My Thoughts, Avant released two more platinum-certified albums, Ecstasy (2002) and Private Room (2003). He also added several more top 10 singles to his arsenal, including \u201cMakin\u2019 Good Love\u201d and \u201cRead Your Mind.\u201d Fourth album Director\u2014distributed through Geffen and the singer\u2019s final MJM project\u2014was released in 2006. It featured the hit \u201c4 Minutes.\u201d Two years later, Avant segued to Capitol for his self-titled fifth album, which yielded the top 20 single \u201cBreak Ya Back.\u201d Rounding out Avant\u2019s catalog are 2010\u2019s The Letter and the 2011 hits compilation Icon: Avant, both on Verve Forecast.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Goose (USA)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8968625.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Folk, Funk, Indi, Reggae, Jazz, Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Goose is an indie groove band based out of Norwalk, Connecticut.

It was also in Houston where jazz pianist Bob James \u201cdiscovered\u201d him and brought him on tour, which led to five successful albums with Columbia Records, including Cache, Kirk\u2019s first #1 album. As well, Kirk and Bob received a Grammy nomination for their collaboration album, Joined at the Hip. After moving to Los Angeles, Kirk became an in demand session player for top artists like, Barbara Streisand, Al Jarreau, Luther Vandross, Larry Carlton, Quincy Jones and most notably, Whitney Houston, amongst many others. It\u2019s his sax heard on the mega-hit, \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d Kirk soon followed that career high point with his phenomenal hit album released on Warner Bros. Records, For You, perhaps the most successful of over 25 solo recordings to date; others include his eclectic, and much lauded, Gospel According to Jazz series, (Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4). In addition to his many solo projects, Kirk is a member of the popular soul/jazz group, BWB, which features Kirk as the \u201cW\u201d of the group with Rick Braun (trumpet) and Norman Brown (guitar).\n\n\nAn ordained minister, Kirk has earned a Masters of Art in Religion. It\u2019s in this spirit that he serves his community in various ways when his touring schedule allows. There is also his daily fifteen minute podcast, Bible In Your Ear (BIYE), in which he invites you to listen along as he reads through the Bible in a year. In addition to music and ministry, Kirk has a passion to educate young, aspiring musicians and is currently engaged as a music professor at Visible Music College in his hometown of Memphis.\n\n\nKirk is the recipient of numerous awards and acknowledgements for his musical excellence including three Dove Award nominations, an NAACP Image Award nomination and has won two Stellar Awards-Gospel music\u2019s highest honor. A twelve time Grammy nominee, Kirk won his first Grammy award (2011)for Best Gospel Song (\u201cIt\u2019s What I Do\u201d\u2013\u2013featuring Lalah Hathaway) alongside life-long friend and gifted songwriter, Jerry Peters.\n\n\nIn a career spanning decades, Kirk has a sound that is uniquely his; it is a sound that leaves an indelible imprint on the listener.", "otherInfo": "Ray Charles, a native son of Georgia, was a true American treasure. With a blend of the sounds of gospel, blues, jazz and country, he transcended racism and cultural upheavals to share the glory of his music around the world. Along the way he won every major award, from the Georgia Music Hall of Fame to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Inducted into the Rock n\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, he was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award the following year.\n\n\n\nNow a stellar cast of award-winning performers comes together to celebrate Ray\u2019s music: Emmy Award-winner Clint Holmes, 10-time winners of both Grammy Awards and Dove Awards the Gospel Hall of Fame vocal group Take 6, Grammy-nominated vocalist Nnenna Freelon, and multiple Grammy, Dove and Stellar Award winner Kirk Whalum.

Like most successful artists, he comes from humble beginnings. Raised in the farming community of Prickly Pole, just a few miles from the home where Bob Marley grew in Nine Mile, he spent most of his childhood farming alongside his father and four siblings. As a young child he played music on handmade instruments crafted together from bamboo and sardine tins, only getting the chance to try out proper instruments in church when someone with a real guitar would finally set it down. Realizing her brother\u2019s love for music, his sister with combined efforts from their mother, saved her money to buy him his first guitar. For high school he moved from the country to St. Ann\u2019s Bay, where he lived on the same street as Burning Spear, and enlisted in the Ocho Rios High School band. They came second in the All Schools Competition in Kingston, giving him the confidence to move to the city to pursue music.\nIt was his move to Kingston in 1992 that began his musical career. Rarely seen without carrying his guitar, he was given the nickname Danny Gitz. Along with the name, his skill and reputation as an outstanding guitarist began to grow. During the early nineties the legendary Sugar Minott took him under his wing where he eventually became Sugar\u2019s band leader. I-taweh attributes Sugar to making him the musician he is today- \u201cSugar was like a father to me. He was the roughest, but at the same time the kindest, sweetest person. On stage he would let you know in front of thousands of people if you were messing up, but at the same time when you had it he always let us know too and made you feel good. He had a real sense of pride in his music and he was the first real reggae star who as a youth made we feel we were good enough. No matter how good you are, if you don\u2019t get the chance to show it \u2013 what can you do? He was one of the first people who made me believe in myself as a serious musician.\u201d\nIn 1994 he became part of the band High Symbol and after a tour landed in Australia with them. It was in in Australia that I-taweh began singing lead vocals here and there, and gaining some confidence as a front man. In 1998 I-taweh became the youngest member of Count Ossie\u2019s original Nyabhingi group, Mystic Revelation of Rastafari. Until 2007 he extensively toured Europe with the group where they are well known for their traditional Jamaican folk music and workshops which they held at Universities. In France, he began collaboration with reggae group Broussai which led to studio sessions in hotel rooms and the beginnings of tracks that he later used on his first album Overload.\nNot only was I-taweh in demand for live performances, his incredible versatility and precision on guitar and bass kept him in high demand in the studio as well. During the 90\u2019s he recorded with artists such as: Sade, Capleton, Morgan Heritage, Sugar Minott, Luciano, Lenky Roy, and Iqulah.\nIt was with Everton Blender, as the guitarist for the Blend Dem Band, that he came to the U.S. during 2004. After the tour, he went on to be the bassist for the Yellow Wall Dub Squad, a major backing band for Jamaican artists in the U.S. Billed as Itawe and often referred to as the Reggae Lion, he quickly gained popularity as the singing bassist opening for artists such as Sister Carol, Prezident Brown, the Abyssinians, Yami Bolo, Half Pint, the Mighty Diamonds, and the Melodians.\nIn 2009, after 17 years of being a supporting musician, I-taweh took a hiatus from the road and began to pursue his solo album. In 2011 he released his independently composed, written, and produced first album named Overload under his own label Tap Nat MuziK. In December 2011 I-taweh performed songs from his debut release at his launch party at Wickie Wackie in Bull Bay, Jamaica, as part of a great journey through Jamaica's radio and media landscape. I-taweh formed the band the Reggae Lions for the launch event enlisting veterans Nambo Robinson on trombone along with Everton Gayle on saxophone and Time aka Count Ossie Jr. on percussion. Selections from the Overload album and the Overload single have received significant airplay on numerous stations in Jamaica and both have become a 2011-2012 hit, reaching #1 on the Hot 102 FM chart. In the U.S., the Overload album has been very well-received at traditional reggae radio, college and syndicated programs and was selected to be part of the Direct TV cable network's menu of reggae material where several songs are in regular rotation. There has been considerable attention at radio and TV for Overload and the song has become popular with people of all ages.\nWith his all-star band, the Reggae Lions, he is currently touring and captivating audiences all over the world with his moving lyrics, confident stage presence, and phenomenal talent. I-taweh\u2019s unique and original sound comes from his Jamaican roots influence combined with inspirations from his travels abroad. His music is diverse and reflects his passion for Human Rights and Social Justice. Whether performing acoustic guitar with a stand- up bass, or with his full ten piece band, he is quickly winning the hearts of his listeners everywhere and continuously leaves his audience wanting more!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Tanukichan", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8667485.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Panache's Valentine's Day Village of Love Planned Parenthood Benefit Show\n8 pm doors\n$20 adv / $25 doors\nall ages"}, {"Address": "1000 Great Hwy, San Francisco, CA 94121", "Artist": "Johnny Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.510542, 37.769815], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Johnny Smith at Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant: The occasional jazz bands that play at the Beach Chalet may try valiantly to compete for attention with the Chalet's menu (full dinner served until 11 p.m.), handcrafted brews, and striking coastal view - but with vistas of the Pacific Ocean as epic as these, the musicians face a losing proposition.

While some folks might have written-off Ginuwine as just another pretty boy destined to be a fad, he proved the naysayers wrong when he returned with the brilliant sophomore project 100% Ginuwine.

Though Ginuwine\u2019s presence has been missed on the charts during his absence, he has been doing much touring both domestically and overseas. As expected, the singer is no slouch when it comes time to take it to the stage. In 2007 a supergroup was formed that consists of successful R&B singers Tyrese, Ginuwine, and Tank. Their first song was a remix of Tank's \"Please Don't Go\". The trio also appeared on Slim Thug's single \"Let Me Grind\". In an interview, Tyrese said the group would be the \"ultimate R&B fan experience. Me, Tank and Ginuwine been talking about this forever. The reason why this makes sense is that besides all of us being R&B singers, we're all good friends. Every time I see Tank, every time I see Ginuwine, we all had good energy regardless.\" In 2008 Ginuwine announced on his MySpace blog that due to label and legal issues they will not be able to release an official TGT album at the moment. On September 22, 2012, Tyrese reveal on his Twitter page that the group has been officially signed to Atlantic Records. They are currently working on their debut album.

Luckily, the punk movement was opening up new avenues for music all over Britain, and also finding a spiritual kinship with protest reggae. Thus, the group wound up as an opening act for punk and new wave bands like the Clash, the Stranglers, Generation X, the Police, and XTC, and built a broad-based audience in the process. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Steel Pulse developed a theatrical stage show that leavened their social commentary with satirical humor; many of the members dressed in costumes that mocked traditional British archetypes (Riley was a vicar, McQueen a bowler-wearing aristocrat, Martin a coach footman, etc.). The band issued two singles -- \"Kibudu, Mansetta and Abuku\" and \"Nyah Love\" -- on small independent labels, when they then came to the attention of Island Records after opening for Burning Spear.\n\nSteel Pulse's first single for Island was the classic \"Ku Klux Klan,\" which happened to lend itself well to the band's highly visual, costume-heavy concerts. It appeared on their 1978 debut album, Handsworth Revolution, which was soon hailed as a classic of British reggae by many fans and critics, thanks to songs like the title track, \"Macka Splaff,\" \"Prodigal Son,\" and \"Soldiers.\" Riley departed before the follow-up, 1979's Tribute to the Martyrs, which featured other key early singles in \"Sound System\" and \"Babylon Makes the Rules,\" and solidified the band's reputation for uncompromising political ferocity. That reputation went out the window on 1980's Caught You, a more pop-oriented set devoted to dance tracks and lovers rock. By that point, Steel Pulse was keen on trying to crack the American market, and went on tour over Island's objections. Caught You was issued in the States as Reggae Fever, but failed to break the group, and they soon parted ways with Island.\n\nSteel Pulse moved on to Elektra/Asylum, which released an LP version of their headlining set at the 1981 Reggae Sunsplash Festival. Their studio debut was 1982's True Democracy, a generally acclaimed set that balanced bright, accessible production with a return to social consciousness. It became their first charting LP in America, making both the pop and R&B listings. The slicker follow-up, Earth Crisis, was released in 1984 and featured producer Jimmy \"Senyah\" Haynes subbing on guitar and bass for founding members Gabbidon and McQueen, both of whom left the group by the end of the recording sessions. They were replaced by guitarist Carlton Bryan and bassist Alvin Ewen for 1986's Babylon the Bandit, another Haynes-produced effort that ranked as the group's most polished, synth-centered record to date. It featured the powerful \"Not King James Version\" and won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album.\n\nIn 1988, Steel Pulse released State of Emergency, their most explicitly crossover-oriented album yet. They also contributed the track \"Can't Stand It\" to the soundtrack of Spike Lee's classic Do the Right Thing. In 1991, they released another heavily commercial album, the Grammy-nominated Victims, which featured the single \"Taxi Driver.\" Backing up the song's views, Steel Pulse filed a class-action lawsuit against the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging that drivers discriminated against blacks and particularly Rastafarians. Founding member Fonso Martin left that year, reducing Steel Pulse to a core trio of Hinds, Nisbett, and Brown. Their backing band still featured Ewen and was elsewhere anchored by guitarist Clifford \"Moonie\" Pusey, keyboardist Sidney Mills, trumpeter Kevin Batchelor, Saxophonist Jerry Johnson and Trombonist Clark Gayton.\n\nThe 1992 live album Rastafari Centennial marked the beginning of a return to the group's musical roots, and earned another Grammy nomination. The following year, they performed at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration, the first reggae band to appear at such an event. 1994's studio album Vex completed Steel Pulse's re-embrace of classic roots reggae, though it also nodded to contemporary dancehall with several guest toasters and a digital-flavored production. 1997's Rage and Fury continued in a similar vein, and was nominated for a Grammy. In 1999, the group released another collection of live performances, Living Legacy.\n\nFast forward a long seven years since their previous album, Rage and Fury, Steel Pulse would return yet again, this time with African Holocaust, and yet again have their ranks dwindled. Core members David Hinds (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Selwyn Brown (keyboards, backing vocals) are the only ones to remain from the band's original line-up, but they more than hold their own and they're joined by a deep roster of supporting musicians, a list too long to list. As always, the music is what's most important, and on that count, this Steel Pulse lineup indeed makes the mark. Granted, it did take them seven years to get the album out, but still it won a Grammy Awards Nomination for Best Reggae Album of the year. There's really not too much else to say about African Holocaust. Longtime fans will know what to expect. Newcomers should know a few things: above all, Steel Pulse are known for performing well-written, Afrocentric songs that are rebellious without being negative or inflammatory, and though the band membership has changed over the years, the type of songs hasn't, nor has the steady move away from dancehall that was apparent on the band's previous album. the message and music remain true to the band's principles and vision.\n\nSteel Pulse is one of Britain's greatest reggae bands, in terms of creative and commercial success. Steel Pulse started out playing authentic roots reggae with touches of jazz and Latin music, and earned a substantial audience worldwide. Their 1978 debut, Handsworth Revolution, is still regarded by many critics as a landmark and a high point of British reggae. By the late '80s, Steel Pulse had won a Grammy and were working full-fledged crossover territory.

There was the band with revolving lineups that existed from 1982 to 1988 and made four albums including \u201cThe Days of Wine and Roses\u201d and \u201cMedicine Show,\u201d both of which regularly show up on Best-Of lists and have influenced bands and delighted fans in the years since.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the band that reunited in 2012 and is closing in on its seventh year, longer than the run of Phase One, with nary a lineup change. This 21st Century version of the Dream Syndicate released \u201cHow Did I Find Myself Here\u201d in 2017 to universal acclaim, no small feat for a band reuniting after almost three decades.\n\nI mean, go ahead. Try to name a band whose reunion record stacks up against the music they made the first time around. Go ahead. We\u2019re waiting.\n\n\u201cI felt like we threaded the needle pretty nicely on the last album,\u201d says founder and singer/guitarist/songwriter Steve Wynn, \u201creferencing who we were and what we had done the first time around but also taking it all someplace new and fresh. It\u2019s a tough balance. Ignore your past and you\u2019re just using the band\u2019s name for convenience, mire yourself too much in the past and you\u2019re a parody\u2014you are your own Rutles. We did neither. We were proud of the record and it was really nice to see that our fans and newcomers alike felt the same way. We were able to go out and play shows of mostly new songs and it really made us feel good to see that the audience knew the record and it was what they had come out to hear us play.\u201d\n\nTherefore, with that reintroduction and a full year of touring behind them, the Dream Syndicate had the freedom to take it all somewhere new, to dig a little deeper, get outside of themselves a little bit. Their new album \u2018These Times\u2019 (May 3, ANTI-) feels like a late-night radio show that you might have heard as a kid, drifting off into dreams and wondering the next morning if any of it was real.\n\n\u201cThat was my favorite way to hear music\u201d says Wynn. \u201cRadio under the pillow, KPPC-FM in Pasadena playing the Persuasions, Van Morrison, Captain Beefheart, Miles Davis, Neil Young, Yes, Curtis Mayfield and Roxy Music.

There was the band with revolving lineups that existed from 1982 to 1988 and made four albums including \u201cThe Days of Wine and Roses\u201d and \u201cMedicine Show,\u201d both of which regularly show up on Best-Of lists and have influenced bands and delighted fans in the years since.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the band that reunited in 2012 and is closing in on its seventh year, longer than the run of Phase One, with nary a lineup change. This 21st Century version of the Dream Syndicate released \u201cHow Did I Find Myself Here\u201d in 2017 to universal acclaim, no small feat for a band reuniting after almost three decades.\n\nI mean, go ahead. Try to name a band whose reunion record stacks up against the music they made the first time around. Go ahead. We\u2019re waiting.\n\n\u201cI felt like we threaded the needle pretty nicely on the last album,\u201d says founder and singer/guitarist/songwriter Steve Wynn, \u201creferencing who we were and what we had done the first time around but also taking it all someplace new and fresh. It\u2019s a tough balance. Ignore your past and you\u2019re just using the band\u2019s name for convenience, mire yourself too much in the past and you\u2019re a parody\u2014you are your own Rutles. We did neither. We were proud of the record and it was really nice to see that our fans and newcomers alike felt the same way. We were able to go out and play shows of mostly new songs and it really made us feel good to see that the audience knew the record and it was what they had come out to hear us play.\u201d\n\nTherefore, with that reintroduction and a full year of touring behind them, the Dream Syndicate had the freedom to take it all somewhere new, to dig a little deeper, get outside of themselves a little bit. Their new album \u2018These Times\u2019 (May 3, ANTI-) feels like a late-night radio show that you might have heard as a kid, drifting off into dreams and wondering the next morning if any of it was real.\n\n\u201cThat was my favorite way to hear music\u201d says Wynn. \u201cRadio under the pillow, KPPC-FM in Pasadena playing the Persuasions, Van Morrison, Captain Beefheart, Miles Davis, Neil Young, Yes, Curtis Mayfield and Roxy Music. It all fit together somehow, one hazy, psychedelic stew that held together mostly because of the late hour, the state of consciousness and the willingness to be absorbed by it all without filter or fear. Complete immersion in another world.\u201d\n\nSo, what does it sound like? If \u201cHow Did I Find Myself Here\u201d was a 10 pm record, all swagger and cathartic explosion, then \u201cThese Times\u201d is the 2 am sibling, moodier and more mercurial, the band acting as DJs of their own overnight radio station, riffing on an idea of what a Dream Syndicate album could be at this moment in time.

It was also during this time that the band\u2019s label stateside began lining up synchronization opportunities that sowed the seeds for what was to come.\n\n2008\u2019s self-titled album ushered in an era where the band truly grew a global fanbase, as the record remains their top-grossing title to date and the band was able to graduate to headliner status in large venues everywhere. Toward the end of the album\u2019s initial cycle, Hollywood and the entertainment world at large came calling in a major way, largely sparked by Brad Pitt and director Bennett Miller\u2019s passionate enthusiasm for the band. The duo initially paired THIS WILL DESTROY YOU\u2019s \u201cThe Mighty Rio Grande\u201d to five crucial acts in 2011\u2019s Moneyball, with Villa Del Refugio then going into Pitt\u2019s subsequent World War Z and Miller\u2019s next film Foxcatcher. The licensing landscape exploded from there, as the band and the first two albums were represented across all major sporting events (Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup, Wimbledon, ESPYS, et al), cultural shifts (the UFC\u2019s rollout package for Ronda Rousey), Hollywood\u2019s biggest night (see: Tom Cruise introducing the nominees and awarding \u201cBest Picture\u201d over \u201cThe Mighty Rio Grande\u201d at the 2012 Oscars), and numerous Emmy-award winning dramas on television.\n\n2011 saw a change in rhythm section and an experiment in the darker capacities of the band. Tunnel Blanket features the most raw and visceral material in the band\u2019s catalog. The band stayed on the road (including a meaningful run in direct support of Deftones), issued a triple live album (2013\u2019s Live In Reykjavik, Iceland), and began formulating what would become 2014\u2019s Another Language album, an exemplar of the band and producer John Congleton\u2019s studio prowess.\n\nFrom 2016-2018, the band was able to successfully stage special tenth anniversary shows and tours celebrating Young Mountain and self-titled at high-capacity, sold out gigs around the globe, punctuated by being hand-picked by The Cure to perform in front of tens of thousands at the band\u2019s fortieth anniversary concert in London\u2019s historic Hyde Park. On the front end of that cycle, Galindo and King also managed to successfully pull off writing and recording the ambitious score to the most talked-about new restaurant of 2018, Los Angeles, Calfornia\u2019s Vespertine.\n\nTHIS WILL DESTROY YOU will return to stages this fall on a North American headlining tour. Slated to commence on October 16th in Phoenix, Arizona, the trek will wind its way through over two dozen cities, coming to a close November 17th in San Diego, California. See all confirmed dates below.

Kenji\u2019s DJ style is characterised by unmistakable romantic, spacey, and eclectic selection from his famously extensive record collection. His label Crue-L Records has been at the forefront of Japanese alternative music since its inception 28 years ago.

The label was launched as a platform for music produced by Eug\u2019s immediate circle of friends, and although eight years on the scope is now unmistakably international, that sense of community remains. The discography, which by the end of 2019 will comprise of 21 releases, features more than 20 contributing artists including Soulwax, Tim Sweeney, Jacques Renault, Earth Boys, Mark E, Velvet Season & The Hearts of Gold, Eric Duncan and Force of Nature. There is no definitive sound attached to the label, but rather each release is carried out as a focussed individual project, receiving its own distinct direction and treated with the utmost care and attention to detail. A long time DJ, Eug took on the role of \u201cparty promoter\u201d due to not finding the exact party he wanted to frequent. He would start the party FACE in 2007, aiming to bridge the gap between San Francisco\u2019s bar and club scenes. After outgrowing its small dive bar origins, Eug moved the party into larger club venues where he has hosted notables such as DJ Harvey, James Murphy, Massive Attack, 2Many DJ\u2019s, Jamie XX, Daniele Baldelli and many more. Regardless of the size and nature of the venue, the music policy has always been about mixing things up and offering plenty of variety. This philosophy of musical diversity and anything goes, would eventually birth the FACE party mantra - \u201cIts not a genre, it's a feeling\u201d.JEREMY CASTILLO (Club Lonely | SF)https://soundcloud.com/jeremy_castilloClub Lonely resident, Soo Wavey familia, and all around house fiend, Jeremy Castillo plays house the way it's meant to be heard -- loud.

from a source. \"warmth emanated from the fire\" synonyms: originate, stem, derive, proceed, spring, issue, emerge, flow. Biography: Emanate (Mioli Music // San Francisco) Emanate (Emily & Nate) fell in love with the mystique of electronic music at an early age. Nathan Vain knew right away what his future passion held when he acquired his first turntables at the age of 17. Emily Fox took a different route starting her journey in the music scene as an organizer and promoter. This endeavor lead to landing Nathan his first residency at a popular after hours spot back in 2001. A few years down the road and a desire for their success growing strong they moved to San Francisco together and started producing music as Emanate. Nathan enhanced his knowledge of music and the industry working at DanceRecords(dot)com from \u201804 to \u201809 as a Content Manager. That was followed by a stint interning at the Mothership / Dirtybird labels. He also spent some time at the DJTechTools office working with midi controllers and software. Emily has developed her understanding of Electronic music culture by throwing various events throughout San Francisco over the years. She also spent some time as a member of (a few) bands where she was writing songs, singing and playing keyboard. Emily\u2019s next logical step became DJing, as a way to expand her talents and performance needs. Following the path of natural evolution they started up their own label Mioli Music in 2010 (Move It Or Lose It). Since 2010 they\u2019ve released music as Emanate and individually. They have also signed various international artists on Mioli. Both Emanate and Mioli had a breakout year in 2013 when Kollektiv Turmstrasse charted their remixes of Lily Ackerman\u2019s \u201cAfrica\u201d and also their remix of TrAck\u2019s \u201cStay\u201d on Resident Advisor. Being featured, charted and played in DJ sets along with the likes of Stimming, Adriatique, Bonobo and David August was a milestone that validated their hard work and dedication, it also alerted the world of their arrival. A relocation to Berlin in early 2014 helped formulate and solidify their craft and sound. While in Berlin Emanate produced and released their debut album \u201cAlliance\u201d and played their first Live Show. The Alliance album was well received and featured on various music magazine websites and dance music blogs but also recognized by Emanate as an immensely developmental experience. With their follow up EP \u201cThrough It / Switchiz\u201d getting as much buzz as it has it looks like 2015 will be a door opening year for Emanate. From Techno, Tech House to Deep House you can expect a clever blend and balance of deep and edgy music.

TAKIMI (Crue-L, Being Borings | TYO)https://crackmagazine.net/article/mixprofile/unfold-kenji-takimi-leedsKenji Takimi has been an most important and prolific underground figure in Japan for decades, and one of the true pioneers of the left field disco/dance music worldwide as a DJ as well as a producer. Kenji\u2019s DJ style is characterised by unmistakable romantic, spacey, and eclectic selection from his famously extensive record collection. His label Crue-L Records has been at the forefront of Japanese alternative music since its inception 28 years ago. From his remixes of Nina Kraviz, Cornelius,Hiroshi Fujiwara,Sebastien Tellier, Cut Copy, Phil Manzanera (Roxy Music),Dimitri From Paris, Boris and countless more, to his studio work with dance favourites Theo Parrish, DJ Harvey and many more.EUG (Public Release | SF)https://soundcloud.com/eugUnder the unofficial tagline \u201cA label for music, culture and home to degenerates\u201d, San Francisco based independent record label Public Release Recordings was founded by Eugene \u201cEug\u201d Whang in 2009. The label was launched as a platform for music produced by Eug\u2019s immediate circle of friends, and although eight years on the scope is now unmistakably international, that sense of community remains. The discography, which by the end of 2019 will comprise of 21 releases, features more than 20 contributing artists including Soulwax, Tim Sweeney, Jacques Renault, Earth Boys, Mark E, Velvet Season & The Hearts of Gold, Eric Duncan and Force of Nature. There is no definitive sound attached to the label, but rather each release is carried out as a focussed individual project, receiving its own distinct direction and treated with the utmost care and attention to detail. A long time DJ, Eug took on the role of \u201cparty promoter\u201d due to not finding the exact party he wanted to frequent. He would start the party FACE in 2007, aiming to bridge the gap between San Francisco\u2019s bar and club scenes. After outgrowing its small dive bar origins, Eug moved the party into larger club venues where he has hosted notables such as DJ Harvey, James Murphy, Massive Attack, 2Many DJ\u2019s, Jamie XX, Daniele Baldelli and many more. Regardless of the size and nature of the venue, the music policy has always been about mixing things up and offering plenty of variety. This philosophy of musical diversity and anything goes, would eventually birth the FACE party mantra - \u201cIts not a genre, it's a feeling\u201d.JEREMY CASTILLO (Club Lonely | SF)https://soundcloud.com/jeremy_castilloClub Lonely resident, Soo Wavey familia, and all around house fiend, Jeremy Castillo plays house the way it's meant to be heard -- loud. With a nod to the classic midwestern house sound, the SF native beats up the dance floor with everything from classic to contemporary jacking house, NJ/NY garage, intimate italo disco vocal cuts, and hidden gems awaiting the right moment of the evening. Wherever he's at, you'll find him behind the decks dropping fog machine floor fillers for the heads, freaks, and everyone in between.STEVE C (Maas and Stacks | SF)Everything you\u2019ve heard is true...- - - -21+ | No Refunds | ATMs on siteSound by Funktion-One (Official)Stay connected: publicsf.com/connectTicket transfers: bigneon.comPublic Works - The Loft161 Erie Street | SF, CA 94103"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Brian Williams", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7258626.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "During a Neath playing career which spanned 16 years Williams played for the club more than 250 times.

Chasing Summer is the third project to date from the R&B impresario born Sir Darryl Farris, and marks his first release under the partnership between Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) and RCA Records. This album follows his 2018 debut LP November \u2014 which also served as his coming-out party on the roster of TDE, a stacked lineup that counts fellow musical luminaries like Kendrick Lamar and SZA in its midst \u2014 SiR is wasting no time in expanding his lovingly languid and sensual sound. Even in the constantly-innovating genre of R&B, SiR has stood head and shoulders above his peers, and Chasing Summer showcases the artistry that elevated him to the position he currently holds.\n\nAfter the release of November, SiR hit the road hard on a back-to-back-to-back tour schedule that saw him reaching audiences far and wide more than ever before. \"We didn't have any time to do anything but perform, shake hands, and kiss babies,\" he marvels. \"We had a lot of fun, and I learned a lot about myself and people in general.\" And the thematic inspiration for Chasing Summer came from those experiences on the road \u2014 SiR's interactions with others around the world, as well as what he learned about himself in the aftermath. \"It's about the duplicity that's my life,\" he explains. \u201cI walk through some of the situations I've encountered and talk about some of the things that have happened to me.\"\n\nTravel is the name of the game here, from the bag tags featured on Chasing Summer's front cover to the passport-styled imagery on the back \u2014 not to mention the album's marking of the latest stop in an artistic journey that SiR's continuing to take. \"It's an evolution,\" he states regarding the album's sound and style. \"I have my own sound that's been locked in for the last five years, but I take a lot of risks from what I'm saying and how I transition from song to song. There's a lot of growth.\"\n\nThere's a yearning at the center of Chasing Summer as well \u2014 the type of internal conflict that all ages relate to, as the seasons change and hearts become more carefree: \"I thought I was gonna find freedom on the road\u2014the freedom to do what I wanted. It's the lifestyle of summer\u2014kids think of being out of school, and adults think of taking vacation and doing what they want. It's the lifestyle they dream of\u2014where they can enjoy life and not have to worry so much about the everyday grind. On the road, I felt like I was chasing summer for sure.\"\n\nWork on Chasing Summer took place over the last four years in SiR's personal studio (\"I'm hands-on with everything\"), with some songs dating well before the auspicious debut that was November. \"We re-cut and re-mixed songs to make everything sound cohesive sonically,\" he explains on the effort to keep things fresh. Along with SiR's deft studio hand, production was contributed from TDE heavy-hitters like Kal Banx, Taebeast and Sounwave, along with notable producers such as Boi-1da, Michael Uzowruru and LordQuest; on the features end, a wide range of music's finest adds some spice to the broth, from Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne to Jill Scott, recent TDE signing Zacari, Sabrina Claudio, Smino and Kadhja Bonet.\n\nLamar features on the opening track and first single \"Hair Down,\" a butter-smooth cut featuring SiR's distinctive vocals that was written on the road with the TDE crew. \"I was having a tough time adjusting to what was going on,\" he explains regarding his mindset behind writing the song. I write as my therapy, and I needed to write a record to instill confidence in myself. I wanted to write a record that I knew the fans could enjoy that also had a message behind it, which is to be comfortable about being yourself.\"\n\nOver the muted squall and knocking drums of \"You Can't Save Me,\" SiR details the type of complicated encounter that inspired much of Chasing Summer: \"I wanted the cake, but I definitely couldn't eat it,\" he laughs while explaining the lyrical inspiration. \"It's about a young man who wants what he can't have. There's a mutual respect there, but also a hint of disappointment and regret about how things turn out. It paints a beautiful picture on both sides.\"\n\nThen there's the aqueous \"Still Blue,\" which features Scott in an artistic reunion years after SiR co-wrote for the R&B icon earlier in his career. \"At first, it was just gonna be an interlude, but everyone loved it so much that we were trying to figure out what to do to extend it,\" he explains. I decided to send her music and let her know I wanted to be part of the project, and she accepted. Her work ethic is crazy. It was an honor to have her pull up and bless this project.\"\n\nAmidst the helping hands, however, Chasing Summer is pure, unadulterated SiR \u2014 a true reflection of where he is in the here and now, as well as an impressive expression of musical and personal reflection. \"A lot of times, artists will say one thing and mean a whole other thing,\" he ruminates. \"On this album, I was just telling my truth. I try to leave things up to interpretation at times, but now I want my fans to know I'm not holding back when it comes to who I am.\" And Chasing Summer proves that continuing to dive into SiR's unique mindset is its own reward.", "otherInfo": "Teknical Funk and the Rooster present\nANGELS AND DEVILS\nMain Room: \"Where Angels and Devils collide\"\nFreQ Nasty (LA)\nTek Freaks (Teknical Funk, SF)\nMr. Bounceman (The Bounce ArtCar, Santa Cruz, CA)\nDJ Loomer (Cruz Coalition, LA)\nDJ B33SON (EPR, SF)\nLounge: \"Lust or love?\"\nLiquid Love Drops (Jocelyn, Club Exoctica, Bay Area)\nFreQ Nasty\nElectrique Thumbprint (Symbiosis, Eclipse)\nZara\nDazzle Room:\n\"Nirvana, a safe Haven for Angels to sing pure and true\"\nUltraviolet (Trap City, SF)\nVNDMG (Saturate Records, SF)\nChantski (Duck Pond, SF)\nAbove DNA:\n\"Where some Lovers Lie and True Love Conquers all!\"\nBilly Casazza (Opulent Temple, Bay Area)\nBrian Williams (Opulent Temple, Bay Area)\nDJ Cue (Airpusher, SF)\nStrick9 - (DuckPond, SF)\nSir Rock (Recreation, SF)\nBuy tickets: https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2020/02-14d.html\nhouse. future bass. breaks. techno. electro. world beat. trap.\n10pm - 5am.\n18+ with ID.\n$20, $25, limited advance;\n$30 after;\n$30 door with costume;\n$40 without.\nRSVP: https://www.facebook.com/events/133638531021364"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "DJ Cue", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-hop, Breaks/breakbeat, Hip Hop, Electronic, Rap, Techno", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Teknical Funk and the Rooster present\nANGELS AND DEVILS\nMain Room: \"Where Angels and Devils collide\"\nFreQ Nasty (LA)\nTek Freaks (Teknical Funk, SF)\nMr. Bounceman (The Bounce ArtCar, Santa Cruz, CA)\nDJ Loomer (Cruz Coalition, LA)\nDJ B33SON (EPR, SF)\nLounge: \"Lust or love?\"\nLiquid Love Drops (Jocelyn, Club Exoctica, Bay Area)\nFreQ Nasty\nElectrique Thumbprint (Symbiosis, Eclipse)\nZara\nDazzle Room:\n\"Nirvana, a safe Haven for Angels to sing pure and true\"\nUltraviolet (Trap City, SF)\nVNDMG (Saturate Records, SF)\nChantski (Duck Pond, SF)\nAbove DNA:\n\"Where some Lovers Lie and True Love Conquers all!\"\nBilly Casazza (Opulent Temple, Bay Area)\nBrian Williams (Opulent Temple, Bay Area)\nDJ Cue (Airpusher, SF)\nStrick9 - (DuckPond, SF)\nSir Rock (Recreation, SF)\nBuy tickets: https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2020/02-14d.html\nhouse. future bass. breaks. techno. electro. world beat. trap.\n10pm - 5am.\n18+ with ID.\n$20, $25, limited advance;\n$30 after;\n$30 door with costume;\n$40 without.\nRSVP: https://www.facebook.com/events/133638531021364"}, {"Address": "144 Taylor St,, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Boots and The Kats", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8000872.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.41066, 37.783936], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Funk, Soul, Electro", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Piano Fight", "moreBioInfo": "Boots and the Kats is an original funk and soul band with some electo and dance influences from the San Francisco Bay Area", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "401 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94613", "Artist": "Miguel Migs", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10104324.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.403705, 37.77731], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Deep House, Dance Music, Electronic, Soulful House, Nu Disco", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Endup", "moreBioInfo": "MIGUEL MIGS BIOGRAPHY\n\nMiguel Migs grew up in Northern California on his parent\u2019s diverse collection of classic rock, blues, funk, soul and reggae records \u2013 which helped set the tone for his musical inspirations. He infuses these creative influences into his own sound, which combines this wide range of styles, blending them together into his own unique artistry.\n\nMigs emerged from the 90\u2019s deep house underground scene to become the kind of artist who transcends the stylistic limitations of a genre so very few can. His musical journey began after picking up a guitar in his early teenage years and his first outlet was writing songs and playing in Dub/Reggae bands. Although Migs always loved and listened to all different styles of music, in the early 90\u2019s he connected to the soulful sounds of Deep House. By the mid \u201990s he began experimenting with producing electronic dance music. And by the time the new millennium dawned, a string of releases and remixes on numerous leading indie dance labels earned him an enviable reputation among discerning dance music fans worldwide. As Petalpusher, he\u2019d also become a stalwart of the hugely influential Naked Music stable with his original productions, remixes and compilations.\n\nBut even bigger things were to follow.\n\nRead full bio here: http://miguelmigs.com/bio", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "316 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "DJ Galexy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8044920.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413792, 37.771362], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Deep House, Tech-House, Electro House", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Audio Nightclub", "moreBioInfo": "As a DJ, Galexy shares an eclectic vision that pulls from his various homes with Western upbringing and Black Rock desert heritage.\nHe doesn\u2019t restrict himself to a unique musical universe.

Over the last couple of years, the man originally turned on to the dance by Derrick Carter has fomented his own groove driven, emotive brand of house that now resonates around the world. Turning heads right from the off were his compilations on Deep Down and Defected, which found Sonny adding his remix flair to a bunch of classics, and after that came sophomore effort After Parties & Aeroplanes. Again a collaborative affair featuring the likes of Doorly, Gene Farris and Cajmere, it was a more jacking, sharp-edged treat designed for maximum dance floor impact, but was also stuffed with unforgettable vocals that agin saw Sonny stepping up his game.\n\n2016 saw the already influential artist stepping up yet again, this time by making his brilliant entry into the hallowed Defected In the House series. His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "Dom Dolla & Sonny Fodera"}, {"Address": "900 Marin St, San Francisco, CA 94124", "Artist": "Dom Dolla", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9377005.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.386006, 37.749454], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: House, Electronic, Deep House, Tech House", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Midway", "moreBioInfo": "ARIA award nominated Melbourne producer Dom Dolla, has seen a meteoric rise following the release of his global house hit \u2018Take It\u2019.

The video also received copious amounts of love from rage and the blogosphere.

In March she released new single \u2018How Could You Believe That\u2019 - a reflection on feeling powerless in supporting a friend who finds themselves stuck in a toxic relationship \u2013 and will release her self-titled debut EP on Friday June 17.

He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\n\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\n\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\n\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\n\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\n\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\n\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\n\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\n\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\n\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

They say there\u2019s an innate bond between siblings, a relationship is forged that can last a lifetime. Now, take that intuitive understanding and translate it into music; magic can happen. This is exactly the case for the brothers of Lime Cordiale, whom growing up within a creative, musical family on Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches, it was natural for the pair to make music together.\n\nLime Cordiale express their feelings that people need to break the rules in order to progress, with Oli stating \u201cyou don't have to take the conservative route. You don't need to necessarily plan out your life in your twenties or thirties\u201d. With the brothers compassionate and progressive awareness, the band are focussed on using their love of music to keep Sydney\u2019s music scene alive, along with the support from their surrounding communities and the Australian community as a whole.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the pair are passionate, and overly sensitive to the effect humans have on Australia\u2019s environment after being raised on an island home and in coastal areas while growing up. The band\u2019s vegan lifestyle and plastic free rider may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes, but their response is simply - \u201cfuck \u2018em\u201d.\nIn addition to the hectic schedule and life-band balance, Louis is an avid artist holding regular showcases, but notes that whether he is cutting lino or painting, this side of his life is kept secluded, \u201cLino cutting is a very time-consuming art form, requires a lot of attention and I find myself doing it alone\u201d says Louis. His art form though does cross over to band-life, with Louis designing all album art, posters and merchandise and states that the creative process can take time to think up ideas and sometimes his work can get so out of control he has to go into hiding, but he calls it \u201cmeditative and an escape\u201d and likes the process itself over the end result.\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t busy playing shows, cutting footage for films or designing some form of artwork, Oli and Louis return to their roots, the ocean. Though they love being close to the CBD, sometimes the inner-city pressure means they need to get back to the freedom that the ocean can give, Oli tells \u201cyou can be working in the dirt and grind of the city just behind you, but out there on the waves the world is yours\u201d.\n\nLime Cordiale received no airplay from triple j, FBI or commercial radio with the release of their debut album \u201cPermanent Vacation\u201d in Oct 2017, but this essentially underground band was in no need of the tastemaker radios support. Lime Cordiale were happy touring Australia, brewing a strong following along the way. With the release of their single \u201cDirt Cheap\u201d (Nov \u2013 18) the band exploded to the charts of triple j, then after only 3 short months the single placed #86 on triple j\u2019s infamous Hottest 100 countdown.\n\nIn Feb 2019, Lime Cordiale released their latest single \u201cMoney\u201d to accompany their fast selling tour of the same name. The extensive run of shows includes Melbourne, New Zealand and Sydney, and will continue in April to Tasmania, Adelaide, Western Australia and regional New South Wales. So far selling out every show (bar one) they\u2019ve performed (14/20 sold out) and over 5300+ tickets sold. Meanwhile the single was succeeding by its own right, featuring on Spotify\u2019s New Music Friday, iTunes\u2019 Best of the Week and by week 2 was #1 most played on triple j.\n\nThe road ahead looks bright and busy for Sydney based band Lime Cordiale, with a new album just over the horizon and a long-awaited European tour set to unite their international audiences.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "420 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Led Zeppelin II", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9628785.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.409593, 37.787565], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Classic Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "August Hall", "moreBioInfo": "LED ZEPPELIN 2 - THE LIVE EXPERIENCE brings you the excitement of Led Zeppelin \"In Concert\" by re-enacting the live improvisation & onstage interaction that earned Led Zeppelin their legendary status for performing.

No era para menos: todo su entorno respiraba y transitaba alrededor de la m\u00fasica: sus padres famosos cantantes (Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal y Junior), sus dos hermanos mayores integrantes de un popular\u00edsimo dueto juvenil (Antonio y Carmen). As\u00ed las cosas, fue algo natural que su familia la invitara a grabar a los 3 a\u00f1os su primera canci\u00f3n: No estar\u00e1s m\u00e1s sola. A pesar de su talento innato sus padres decidieron que su peque\u00f1a ni\u00f1a viviera una infancia normal y cursara sus estudios de manera regular. Pero siempre se las ingeni\u00f3 para combinar el agresivo curr\u00edculo educativo biling\u00fce que llevaba con clases de canto y danza. Toda la brillantez art\u00edstica que ha caracterizado desde siempre a su Madrid natal, tambi\u00e9n reforz\u00f3 lo vivido en su casa. A los doce a\u00f1os debut\u00f3 en el reconocido programa de TV, Noches de Gala y, terminada la escuela, Luis Sanz, el mismo productor que descubriera a su madre en los 1959, la invit\u00f3 a participar en una popular serie de televisi\u00f3n de su pa\u00eds (\u201cEn plena forma\u201d). Su naturalidad frente a las c\u00e1maras, combinada con su belleza tan impresionante como natural, la convirtieron enseguida en la candidata perfecta para campa\u00f1as publicitarias de su pa\u00eds. Siendo una adolescente todav\u00eda, film\u00f3 varios comerciales de ropa para la televisi\u00f3n. Con el tiempo, estas ofertas se fueron extendiendo y, en \u00e9pocas m\u00e1s recientes, ha sido el rostro para campa\u00f1as publicitarias en Am\u00e9rica Latina de grandes firmas como Avon, Degree y Gillette, por citar algunas. A principios de los 90\u2019s su mam\u00e1 la invit\u00f3 a participar en una gira de conciertos por Am\u00e9rica Latina en calidad de corista: \u201cVer a grandes masas de gente corear sus temas y manifestarle su cari\u00f1o fue algo que me marc\u00f3 para siempre.\u201d Casi al mismo tiempo, su padre tambi\u00e9n le revel\u00f3 otra parte importante de su nueva carrera: la grabaci\u00f3n de un disco. \u201cAntes de tener siquiera la oportunidad de grabar un disco, \u00e9l me revel\u00f3 todo lo que implicaba un proyecto de estos: desde las t\u00e9cnicas de grabaci\u00f3n, hasta los equipos\u2026 \u00a1Qu\u00e9 gran privilegio!\u201d En el 2004, lleg\u00f3 la oportunidad de presentar su primer disco, \u201cShaila\u201d, una colecci\u00f3n de 10 temas refrescantes con el que present\u00f3 su primera gran pasi\u00f3n: la m\u00fasica pop. Dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, con \u201cRecordando\u201d, no s\u00f3lo le rend\u00eda un homenaje a su madre interpretando los grandes \u00e9xitos de m\u00fasica ranchera que ella hab\u00eda inmortalizado, tambi\u00e9n dej\u00f3 ver cu\u00e1l era el otro gran g\u00e9nero que le encantaba: el ranchero. Ese \u00e1lbum se convirti\u00f3 en un disco de triple platino en Espa\u00f1a. El pr\u00f3ximo disco se llam\u00f3 \u201cTanto Amor\u201d, en el 2006. \u201cFue un \u00e1lbum muy pop y hasta cierto punto biogr\u00e1fico pues representaba todo lo que sent\u00eda como reci\u00e9n casada. Fue un disco maravilloso, que fue nominado al Grammy Latino.\u201d A ra\u00edz de la popularidad alcanzada en el 2008, Shaila D\u00farcal recibi\u00f3 la invitaci\u00f3n del Presidente de Estados Unidos, George W. Bush, para cantar en la Casa Blanca durante la celebraci\u00f3n del Cinco de Mayo. \u201cInterrump\u00ed brevemente mi luna de miel para estar all\u00ed. Pero vali\u00f3 la pena porque fue muy emotivo cantar con mariachis all\u00ed.\u201d Con \u201cCoraz\u00f3n Ranchero\u201d, en el 2009, marc\u00f3 su regreso a la m\u00fasica vern\u00e1cula: \u201cEscog\u00ed muy cuidadosamente los temas, y no me equivoqu\u00e9 porque el disco fue nominado por primera vez al Grammy americano, adem\u00e1s de haber estado nominado al Grammy Latino.\u201d Ahora, en el 2011, Shaila lanza un disco de m\u00fasica ranchera. El t\u00edtulo del \u00e1lbum est\u00e1 directamente relacionado con sus fans: \u201cSe llama \u201cASI\u201d, porque \u201cASI\u201d, de esta manera es que quiero agradecerle los fans que me han acompa\u00f1ado todos estos a\u00f1os. Este homenaje, \u201cASI\u201d, es para ellos.\u201d \"Los temas cuentan con los arreglos de Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, creador del Mariachi Sol de M\u00e9xico. Como ya se puede ver en el primer sencillo (Conv\u00e9nceme), este disco marca mi crecimiento musical.

But behind the geography and moniker is a band of meticulous and literary songwriters matched by a specific brand of brooding, anthem-riding balladry and orchestral indie rock. Murder By Death\u2019s path began in the early 2000s as most Midwestern college-town groups do, by playing to small crowds at ratty venues and frenzied house parties. While many of their formative-year scene-mates failed to make it much further than campustown\u2019s borders, Murder By Death translated their anonymous beginnings into a 10+ year career founded on a bedrock of five full-length albums, tireless D.I.Y. touring and performing ethics, and, most importantly, a dedicated, cult-like fanbase. Since the band began in 2001, their audience has blossomed due in part to extended tours alongside similarly hardworking musical kin such as Against Me!, Gaslight Anthem, Lucero, William Elliott Whitmore, Ha Ha Tonka, and others. Through more than 1,000 performances across the United States, Canada and Europe, Murder By Death has gained word-of-mouth devotees and support from the likes of media outlets like SPIN Magazine, who said of the band, \u201cThey brawl like Johnny Cash\u2019s cellmates or dreamily swoon like Nick [Cave], stomping saloon floorboards in 4/4 time as grand strings fade into high noon.\u201d What resonates most with supporters is the band\u2019s energetic, unique, and altogether consistent sound and conceptualized vision. The personnel and ingredients of the group consist of Sarah Balliet\u2019s throaty cello melodies, singer/guitarist Adam Turla\u2019s booming baritone vocals and brawny guitar strumming, drummer Dagan Thogerson and bassist Matt Armstrong\u2019s locked-down, post-punk rhythm section interplay, and Scott Brackett\u2019s (formerly of Okkervil River and Shearwater) multi-instrumentalist bag of tricks (including piano, trumpet, accordion, mandolin, vocals, percussion). The overriding sound is an amalgamation of textures ranging from dark and desolate to upbeat and brightly melodic, all of it landing somewhere under the orchestrated indie rock umbrella. The other mainstay signature element of Murder By Death\u2019s identity has been built by the overriding concepts behind each individual album. Every successive effort conjures up fresh imaginative and tactile worlds \u2013 whether it\u2019s the battle between the Devil and a small Western town (Who Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them?, 2003), an arid land of death and redemption (In Bocca al Lupo, 2006), or just songs inspired by a retreat into the Tennessee mountains (Good Morning, Magpie, 2010). On September 25, the band releases their newest full-length and Bloodshot Record\u2019s debut Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon. The album was written throughout 2011 in a basement in southern Indiana, and recorded in winter 2011 in Dallas, TX with producer-in-demand John Congleton (Explosions in the Sky, St Vincent, Black Mountain). \"Just remember what old Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake.

And his growing fan base includes none other than Beyonc\u00e9, who selected James to appear in her \u201cRun the World\u201d video. James\u2019 real-deal approach to music and\u2014more important\u2014the craft of singing are the main attractions on his upcoming mix tape and album of the same name: \u201cMade to Love.\u201d Both mark the singer/songwriter\u2019s debut on Mercury/Island Def Jam via New Age Rock Star Records (NARS), the label helmed by award-winning producer Danja (Mariah Carey, Keri Hilson) and long-time collaborator / mixing engineer Marcella Araica (Madonna, Pink, Timbaland). \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fad for me,\u201d declares James. \u201cI\u2019m willing to go wherever with this because music is everything to me. This is my world and how I see it. My music speaks for me in a way that\u2019s relatable and truthful.\u201d \u201cHonest is the best word to describe Luke,\u201d adds Danja, who began working with James nearly four years ago. \u201cEvery message in his songs is sincere. And Luke\u2019s voice is another obvious factor. Putting all of that together, he possesses a universal connection that touches everyone. He\u2019s an undeniable force.\u201d That connection hits home on James\u2019 lead single, \u201cI Want You.\u201d Packed with interesting breaks and tempo shifts, the sparse yet bright track pulsates with an infectious, hip-hop-influenced beat. That foundation provides the perfect complement to James\u2019 pure, arresting falsetto as he sings: \u201cI was just a broken record of one-night stands /Til you came along with your beautiful song \u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about the voice,\u201d says Danja. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what he\u2019s captured on every record. Production doesn\u2019t matter. No matter how sparse or grand I make it, he takes control and makes it about him.\u201d James\u2019 innate talent as a singer/songwriter was nurtured in one of music\u2019s legendary outposts, New Orleans. An only child, he grew up listening to a wide array of influences thanks to his single mother: everyone from Marvin Gaye and Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes to Willie Nelson and Alabama. James\u2019 oh wow moment occurred when he was 11 years old and watching the amateur talent segment on TV\u2019s \u201cShowtime at the Apollo.\u201d One of the contestants began singing Donny Hathaway\u2019s version of writer Leon Russell\u2019s \u201cA Song For You.\u201d \u201cI got chills,\u201d recalls James. \u201cAnd I get that feeling all over again whenever I think about that performance. At the time, I\u2019d never said I wanted to be a singer; I just knew I wanted to entertain. And I\u2019d never heard of Donny. But when my mother found her copy of one of his records, I knew then that I wanted to reach people that way.\u201d While in high school in 2001, James joined a trio that started performing around New Orleans, opening for such acts as Brian McKnight. That\u2019s when James first met his longtime manager Frank Gatson. When things with the trio didn\u2019t work out, James moved to Los Angeles after graduation\u2014on the advice of Gatson\u2014and began singing background for R&B singer Tyrese. It was through the singer that James met production duo the Underdogs and signed with their label as part of a singing duo: Luke & Q. When Luke & Q decided to go their separate ways, James began honing his skills as a songwriter after hooking up with producer Danja nearly four years ago. Since then, he has collaborated on songs for Brown, Bieber, Spears, Keri Hilson and Brandy and worked alongside such other producers as Kadis and Sean and the Messengers. Inspired by those collaborations, he rediscovered his footing as a singer in his own right. \u201cI found the feeling again where I felt something fresh could come out,\u201d says James. \u201cWriting songs helped me figure out what my lane was as far as being a solo artist. And I\u2019ve also learned something else: If I don\u2019t feel it, I can\u2019t do it.

No stranger to challenges, this four-man collective from Kentucky tackled their obstacles and, in the process, their self-honest work emerged in form of 5 studio albums and 10 mix-tapes. As usual, Nappy Roots examine our alienable rights, reason, and truth through lyrical originality and voyage.\n\nSince Nappy Roots entered the music scene in 1998, they have remained real, humble, talented guys with inherent, undeniable southern swagger. After the international success of Watermelon, Chicken, & Grits, selling over 3 million albums, the members of Nappy Roots were flying high while still acutely aware of how far it could be to the bottom should they fall. It is that practical and genuine presence of mind that helped them sustain touring as a group these last ten years. Building a vastly loyal fan-base nationwide, fans and friends can be used interchangeably when referring to their army of followers.\n\nFor most people, it is normal to only share intimate moments with friends, but for the members of Nappy, it is no different when in their living room, studio, or on stage, as they possess the gift of honesty and deliver that message with charisma. That truthfulness is especially reflected in this compilation inspired and written for this moment in time.\n\nAfter severing ties with Atlantic Record and going independent, it was inevitable change was his own for solo efforts. Nappy Roots had no choice but to keep it moving and did so as smoothly as possible. As the saying goes, \u201cthe show must go on,\u201d and so it has, obstacles included.\n\nWith a heavy heart and no major label record deal, Nappy Roots knew they had to remain in pursuit of their destiny and, thus, Nappy Roots Entertainment Group was formed. The members of Nappy Roots were facing foreclosures and a mountain of stress in the jobless economy, but still they remained positive and pushed on, while never forgetting where they came from and what they had accomplished. With fans constantly communicating with the members online and at shows, the guys realized they weren\u2019t the only ones having trouble.\n\nWith the release of their tenth mix-tape \"SH!T'S BEAUTIFUL\" and the departure of Big V from the group, as he left to pursue a solo career, Nappy Roots forges forward. Between touring and recording, the four-man group focuses on consistently putting out quality hip-hop.\n\nA weak man with no vision, no diligence behind the vision, and no faith behind the diligence would have given up, but Skinny Deville, Fishscales, B.

Over the past two decades they have evolved into what The Guardian called \u201cone of the world\u2019s finest Afrobeat bands\u201d while enjoying equal renown for their cross-genre collaborations with legends of popular music. With a heavy balance of experience and new blood, the group leaps into 2020 with their new Daptone Records full-length \u201cFu Chronicles.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1998 by saxophonist Mart\u00edn Perna, early incarnations of the group included several members of The Dap-Kings including bassist / producer Gabriel Roth, guitarist Binky Griptite, keyboardist Victor Axelrod, conguero Fernando \u201cBugaloo Velez,\u201d and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi. As the group expanded, it absorbed younger musicians from the Daptone family including bassist Nick Movshon (El Michels, Black Keys) and other musical natives and transplants from downtown Manhattan and North Brooklyn music scenes.\n\nIn 1999, Perna and Roth dropped in at an atelier / dojo belonging to Duke Amayo. They invited him to a neighborhood concert and then reached out to him later as an emergency substitute for a show. Amayo soon became a fixture in the group, first on percussion, then later on vocals, vibraphone, and keyboards and moving to center stage as the group\u2019s frontman and creating the Afro-Spot, the band\u2019s headquarters as well as the home of the first Daptone Records studio.\n\nOver the next few years, the band performed several times a month throughout NYC at the Afro-Spot, at benefits, lofts, block parties, and at their Lower Manhattan weekly residency called \u201cAfricalia\u201d with regular appearances by friends including Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and The Sugarman Three. After their second release, \u201cTalkatif\u201d (2002, Ninja Tune), the group began touring heavily throughout North America and Europe including performances at Glastonbury, Montreux Jazz Festival, Coachella, Bonnaroo, and the Newport Jazz Festival. Over the years, expanded their travels to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South America, and most recently, Hong Kong.\n\nIn the late 2000s, after nearly ten years of road touring, Antibalas was chosen by choreographer Bill T Jones, to serve as the band for the Tony-award winning Broadway musical \u201cFela.\u201d Around the same time, the band began to draw the attention of the Roots. The two groups joined with Public Enemy to perform a live version of the entire \u201cIt Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back\u201d at the 2009 Roots Picnic as well as the Red Bull Battle of the Bands, as well as numerous guest appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\n\n\nAntibalas has also served as the house band for several star-studded tribute shows at Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theater paying tribute to the music of Aretha Franklin, David Byrne, Paul Simon, and Billie Holiday, backing dozens including Allen Toussaint, Cee Lo Green, Sharon Jones, Santigold, and Angelique Kidjo.\n\nOver the years, different members have traded production and composition duties from album to album. On the new album\u2014\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d\u2014Amayo leads us through a thrilling sonic journey of kung fu meets Afrobeat, weaving together the strands of Edo and Yoruba cultural memory from Nigeria with his training and study in Chinese martial arts.\n\nRecorded in the Summer of 2018, over seventeen musicians and singers crammed into the storied Daptone House of Soul in Bushwick to record the massive body of work. With live versions and arrangements stretching up to thirty minutes, Perna, Amayo, and Roth worked tirelessly to preserve the hypnotic power of the long-form live arrangements into six concise and powerful album tracks.\n\n\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d will be the eighth studio album from Antibalas, who have been releasing music over four decades; Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1 (1999), Talkatif (2002), Who Is This America?

These were slow-growing ideas fed by a certain acid-bitter poetry (Gregory Corso and John Lennon, for two) and by strands and lines unraveled from casually encountered prose or reportage.

Not necessarily his memories, though they creep in often, too. Rather, he mulls over the idea of memory itself: its resilience, its haziness, how it slips away as we try to hang on, the way it resurfaces despite our best efforts to forget.\n\nMemory is the common thread running throughout the Columbus folk-punk band's fourth album, Pillar of Na, arriving in August 31st via ANTI- Records. Following 2015's critically lauded Such Things, the new album's name is rooted in remembrance, referencing the Genesis story of Lot's wife who looks back at a burning Sodom after God instructs her not to. She looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. \"Na,\" meanwhile, is the chemical symbol for sodium. \"Nah\" is a passive refusal and the universal song word. It means nothing and stands for nothing. It is \"as it is.\"\n\nLike Lot's wife, Little cannot help but revisit where-and how-he grew up. Raised in church in southeastern Appalachian Ohio, he took up preaching when he was still a teenager, sometimes in small country settings and other times to congregations of thousands. But these days he's more interested in listening.

Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Indubious was forged in the fires of pain and destruction. Evton and Skip, brothers and bandmates born with Cystic Fibrosis and convinced by doctors of their impending death from an early age, have emerged as a powerful force for change and the future of conscious music. Their only choice has always been mind over matter, and time has proven that their unbending positive outlook, combined with an inspiring message of love and hope, has not only helped them overcome personal hardship, but catapulted their music onto the world stage with an unstoppable momentum.\n\nCurrently based in Oregon, Indubious has released four albums over the past few years, including Wake The Lion which was produced by EDM/Dub/Reggae pioneer Gaudi. Their new album From Zero, which dropped on 7-1-17, debuted at #6 on the Billboard Reggae Chart and #8 on iTunes Reggae Chart, features legendary guest artists including Dancehall icon Sizzla, Vaughn Benjamin (formally of Midnite and Akae Beka), and Reggae/R&B singer Zahira Soul. From Zero is a mix of conscious Dancehall and Roots Reggae with top level production. All songs were written, produced, and engineered by Indubious, and released on their own label Righteous Sound Productions.\n\n\u201cSimply put, Indubious is my favorite band of 2017, and From Zero is my favorite album of 2017 - and it truly\ndeserves to be yours too.\u201d review by Russel A. Trunk via annecarlini.com\n\n\u201cFor me, that\u2019s one of the most original, refreshing pieces of reggae music i\u2019ve heard in a long time. I think it\u2019s really special.\u201d David Rodigan on BBC in regards to the song See Sharp off of From Zero.\n\nArmed with impressive instrumental skill, powerful harmonies, and an electrifying stage presence, Indubious is destined to change the face of music. They have developed a steadily rising reputation as ambassadors of the West Coast Reggae movement. Leaving audiences stunned and amazed whilst shattering any preconceived notions of genre and style, they recruit fans from all walks of life, affectionately called \"Indubians.\"\nIndubious has performed worldwide on international tours and at many prestigious festivals including Wakarusa, Gathering Of The Vibes, Reggae On The River, Sulafest in India, Sierra Nevada World Music Festival, California Roots Festival, Beloved, Britt Festivals, The Oregon Country Faire, Reggae In The Hills, Northwest World Reggae Festival, Earthdance, Gaia Festival, plus club and concert hall tours from Seattle to San Diego. They have shared the stage and toured with many influential names such as Black Uhuru, Matisyahu, Blondie, Michael Franti, Stephen Marley, Rebelution, Junior Reid, and Pato Banton, to name a few.\n\nThe widely acclaimed Indubious album Wake The Lion received featured placement on Beatport, iTunes, Amazon, and numerous media outlets. Indubious' unique sound was brought vibrantly to the surface by the legendary composer/producer Gaudi, showcasing Wake The Lion as a textural journey into the world of Rootstronica. Lush synths, deep bass, and visionary lyricism encompass the entire record, blurring the lines between roots, dub, dancehall, and heavy dance psychedelia. Vibrationally rich and musically brilliant, the album champions a revolutionary sound and pushes the boundaries of reggae music.\n\nThe band and their legion of fans have adopted the motto \u201cLive Indubiously,\u201d which means living life without doubt or fear, and with faith in the fact that we are all here for a reason. \u201cOur gift is music,\u201d says Indubious, \u201cand our mission is to reconnect the people of the world with rightful living. We wish to speak the truth in an effort to inspire others to do the same, to raise the positive vibrations of our planet, and\nto help others express the true loving nature within us all.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $15 Adv & $17 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "13118 CA-9, Boulder Creek, CA 95006", "Artist": "Groovy Judy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8601389.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.121553, 37.124359], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Pop, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul, Funk", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Joe\u2019s Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Groovy Judy puts a new face on the late 60\u2019s, early 70\u2019s sound that made the Bay Area what it is.

Hunter, the band\u2019s only original member, switched from guitar/vocals to drums, and the band never skipped a beat. Tristan, who was at one point the band\u2019s fill in bass player, took on the key roles of guitarist and primary songwriter. The two brothers enlisted the services of bassist/vocalist Alex Kouninos, and later guitarist/vocalist Brian Gellman to round out the sound. The new band quickly developed their own style, with unique three part vocal harmony permeating their recordings, and live performances.\n\nSince the overhaul, Decent Criminal has released a 7\u201d split in 2015, a self-titled debut LP in 2016, and has most recently released their sophomore LP \"Bloom\u201d via Dodgeball Records in 2017.

It had been over twenty years since the singer-songwriter had graduated from Montgomery Blair High School, yet his adolescent dreams, hopes, fears, anxieties and emotions the singer faced as a kid began flooding back; suddenly, the singer felt transported back into his teenage self. Growing up in suburban Maryland, Hutchinson\u2019s teenage years were filled with the type of alienation and private angst recognizable to most anyone who\u2019s ever been 16. Twenty-plus years later, the singer was finally ready to write about it.\n\nThe result: Class of 98, a 90\u2019s alt-rock-inspired autobiographical record that chronicles the singer-songwriter\u2019s adolescence.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to understand myself,\u201d Hutchinson says. \u201cWriting this record allowed me to get into the time machine and go back and look around my old life and report from my current point of view. That was fun. The problems were waiting for me: Who likes me? Why doesn\u2019t this person want to be around me? Why don\u2019t I understand myself?\u201d\n\nAfter experimenting with a series of genres like Americana/soul and jazz on his last few albums Modern Happiness and Before and After Life, the singer-songwriter turned to the pop-punk alt-rock of his youth for the riff-heavy Class of 98, taking inspiration from bands like Green Day, Oasis, and Weezer. \u201cThat music is in my guitar DNA,\u201d says the singer. \u201cI love 90\u2019s music, and this type of sound was so formative for me.\u201d To help round out his sound, Hutchinson recruited Justin Sharbono (formerly of Soul Asylum) to offer his distinctive (and period appropriate) guitar playing on the album. Hutchinson also enlisted the sonic guidance and mixing talents of Paul Kolderie, who\u2019d made great 90\u2019s records with bands like Radiohead, Hole, The Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom and The Pixies.\n\nFor Hutchinson, taking such an imaginative leap with a concept as specifically personal of Class of 98 was an artistic risk he knew he needed to take. \u201cI don\u2019t think people want me to keep making the same record, as much as anyone might think they do,\u201d he says.\n\nThe opening track \u201cRock Out Tonight\u201d sets the scene with a narrative that evokes the high-drama restlessness of a group of teenagers aimlessly driving around the suburbs in a Ford Taurus. The song, says the singer, is about \u201cwanting to be rebellious, but having no idea how to do so.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, cinematic songs like \u201cDrunk at Lunch\u201d and \u201cCooler Than You\u201d show a darker underbelly of Hutchinson\u2019s high-school introversion, echoing a theme that the singer-songwriter has been tackling in his work ever since releasing his chart-topping debut LP Sounds Like This, in 2007. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in asking questions in my songs: who\u2019s cool, who gets to decide, and where do I fit into all of that?\u201d he says.\n\nBut the emotional centerpiece of Hutchinson\u2019s latest, and the song that was the most difficult to write, is \u201cMy Old Man,\u201d written in the wake of his father\u2019s passing, after years of living with Myotonic dystrophy. More than anything else on the album, the deeply personal song gets at the album\u2019s central tension of writing from the teenage perspective while simultaneously embodying the adult point of view.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily get along with my dad in high school,\u201d says the singer. \u201cWe were in different places in our lives and he had different things to worry about. I tried to sing this song from my perspective back then as well as my perspective now, where I\u2019ve made peace with him.\u201d\n\nTaken as a whole, Class of 98 arrives as Hutchinson\u2019s most playful yet distinctive work, one that will surely resonate with longtime fans of the singer\u2019s pop-rock hits like \u201cRock & Roll,\u201d \u201cTell the World,\u201d and \u201cWatching You Watch Him.\u201d For Hutchinson, the experience of delving back into his high school youth helped him learn a lot: about his upbringing, about parenthood, and about himself.\n\n\u201cI like the 90\u2019s way better,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I\u2019m not living in them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Eric Hutchinson"}, {"Address": "420 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "LedZeppelin2", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8172765.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.409593, 37.787565], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Classic Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "August Hall", "moreBioInfo": "LED ZEPPELIN 2 - THE LIVE EXPERIENCE brings you the excitement of Led Zeppelin \"In Concert\" by re-enacting the live improvisation & onstage interaction that earned Led Zeppelin their legendary status for performing.

Expect Dr. Whale to come out with a very strong San Francisco debut.https://soundcloud.com/timstorer259 SET TIMES:Doors: 99-10: Joon B2B Giro10-12: Dr Whale12-2: OMAS---------------21+ | No Refunds | ATMs on siteSound by Funktion-One (Official)Stay connected: publicsf.com/connectTicket transfers: bigneon.comPublic Works 161 Erie Street | SF, CA 94103"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Saratonin", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7089380.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Sparkly Gangsta Mermaid", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Thanks to growing up in a musical family, Calgary born DJ and vocalist Saratonin became familiar with the live stage at a very early age.

Yet the common thread that runs through Craig\u2019s broad musical canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. Carl Craig has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader, guided by his tendency toward forward\n\nthinking.\n\n\n\nCraig released his first track in 1989. One of his earliest mentors and first collaborator was Derrick May, whose imprint Craig also released some of his early music on.\n\n\n\nIn 1991, wanting pure artistic freedom, Craig set up his own label Planet-E and released \u20184 Jazz Funk Classics\u2019, under the moniker 69, as the label\u2019s first release. From here his wild exploration of sound intensified\u2026\n\n\n\nA Gemini true to form, with a mind that never sits still, Craig has released a diverse range of experimental and groundbreaking music under a plethora of aliases including 69, BFC, C2, Innerzone Orchestra (\u2018Bug in the Bassbin\u2019 was credited as the spark that inspired the evolution of drum\u2018n\u2019bass), No Boundaries, Psyche, Paperclip People, Tres Demented, Urban Tribe and many more. He has also produced albums for the legendary Detroit Jazz collective Tribe as well as orchestrator / pianist Francesco Tristano and French producer Agoria.\n\n\n\nLive he has collaborated with Les si\u00e8cles orchestra at Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris. A meeting of techno and classical music, the concert was described as \u201chistorical\u201d, Craig went on to repeat the formula in Milan and Germany. He regularly performs live as experimental outfit Trio with Moritz Von Oswald and Francesco Tristano, sometimes as Narod Niki alongside Villalobos, Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Zip and others, and regularly does part live and part DJ with Luciano. Additionally he\u2019s\n\ntaken to occasionally bringing keyboardists like Mike Banks (UR), Amp Fiddler and Tristano into the DJ booth with him for special one-off gigs. He also improvised live to an Andy Warhol film at the Unsound Festival in New York. In 2011, Craig went live as 69 for the first time ever, fusing masks, darkness and the music of 69, Craig created 69\u2019s own entity and previewed the show to a few select festivals and clubs around the world.\n\n\n\nHis remixes discography boasts some of the most desirable names in music \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Junior Boys (nominated for a Grammy Award), Gavin Russom & Delia Gonzalez, Theo Parrish, Tori Amos, Can, Goldfrapp, Friendly Fires, Caribou, Tiga, Unkle, Yello and more.\n\n\n\nAs well as an outlet for his own productions, his Planet-E imprint has given a home to a wide range of Detroit-based artists including Francesco Mora Catlett, Naomi Daniel, Flexitone, Jason Hogans, Kenny Larkin, Monty Luke, Moodyman, Mike Agent X, Oliverwho Factory, Ezana Harris, Recloose, Reference, Kevin Saunderson, Big Tone, Tribe, Urban Tribe, and Chaz Vincent.\n\n\n\nStaying strong to his Detroit roots, where he still lives today, Craig helped launched the Detroit Electronic music Festival in 2000 and remains a strong force at the festival today. He has also created and launched his non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation: \u201cThe concept is to find ways to re-educate kids about what\u2019s interesting musically that you can\u2019t get on the radio\u2026 To develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of Detroit music being diverse and interesting, to spot out the most talented young musicians coming out of high school and lend small financial grants to encourage music education at a higher level.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen Craig explains his philosophy, his wry sense of humor seeps into his explanations of far-reaching concepts that merge worlds together. \u201cI have a very special career. When I feel that I\u2019m tired of going on the road I can go in the studio. When I\u2019m tired of concentrating on the studio I can go on the road. I can work with concert pianists, jazz musicians or rock guys. Very few people\n\nhave that range of interests. Very few people juggle a career that they choose specifically.\u201d No one else can pull it all together quite like Carl Craig.", "otherInfo": "Carl Craig @ Audio SF"}, {"Address": "101 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "The Garden Party", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Rock & Roll", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Garden Party w/ Sunshine Jones, Benjamin K, Rachel Torro"}, {"Address": "1025 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Tainted Love", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7913132.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.415665, 37.803702], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: ONLY THE VERY BEST OF THE 80S", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Bimbo's 365 Club", "moreBioInfo": "SAN FRANCISCO'S ORIGINAL 80'S TRIBUTE BAND!!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "101 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Benjamin K", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8418285.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, Electronic, House, Sex, R&b, R&b/soul, Deep House, Breaks, Love", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "\"It's a booty shakin sort of a thing.

What started off as a house party and bedroom dj project has now escalated to one of the best known djs around. He has played everywhere with a sound system and always brings the party. He's shared the stage with the likes of J.Phlip, Brenmar, Christian Martin, Eliot Lipp, Ardalan, Ana Sia, Michael Menert, Fort Knox 5, Dj Abilities, and every local in between. With a wide library and vast knowledge of music varying from jackin house to old school breaks to bass driven electronica to O-face hip-hop he plays what makes the feet hop and booties drop. Often describing his music as \"all about sex,\" bring your towel and gold bond, because it's gonna get sweaty.... But it aint just about dj'ing. BK's been well known for his abilities to throw parties like no one's business. It's been an infatuation since a child, to provide all aspects, all sides, all factors needed to form nights that no one soon forgets. Including party planning, booking, graphic design, and promotion. With annual nights beginning with BK Value Meal at The Summit and College Night at The Starlight that then soon escalated to larger theme nights. With plenty of solo promoted parties within his distant history. He later helped create and form local party powerhouse crew Mountain Mayhem, it's aim to build, bring, and host a major sound camp at Burning Man and beyond. With a couple years under their belt now, and parties within town such as Boomtown, Moustache Ride, Pajamma Jammy Jam, Walk of Shame, and two years of Burning Man, they've proved they take having fun Seriously, and have only just begun.

Crooked is known for his work horse mentality, and high energy DJ sets, but has never been one for the industry politics.

In 2007, they brought a piece of home with them by founding KNYEW (acronym for \u201cKeeping New York Every Where), a successful clothing brand, the first of its kind to be seen in Las Vegas. Similarly, both D-Miles and Jaime Da Great grew up in the LA. Jaime, while making a huge name for himself in the sneaker industry, has shifted his focus into becoming a full time DJ. D-Miles climbed the ranks by opening for the industry\u2019s hottest DJ\u2019s and making a name for himself in the process.

He is equally at home playing with jazz veteran Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish sean-n\u00f3s singer Roisin El Safty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata.

His four beautifully crafted solo albums and two co-led releases have garnered widespread critical acclaim.\nFor Turrisi, tradition and improvisation are not different countries but two sides of the same mountain. Turrisi\u2019s musical traditions - formal and folkloric - span the centuries and a large swathe of the history of European migration. This kaleidoscopic vocabulary - always in flux - provides the grist to Turrisi\u2019s improvisational mill and the rough material from which he crafts his uniquely original, haunting music.\nHis ability to rework ancient melodies and rhythms through a contemporary jazz prism marks him out as one of the most striking voices to have emerged on the European jazz scene in the past decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "119 Utah St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Seth Troxler", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9756537.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.406803, 37.768186], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Techno, Sexiness", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "The Great Northern", "moreBioInfo": "Seth Troxler is as widely regarded for his encyclopaedic knowledge of early Chicago house and minimal techno through to obscure indierock and ambient psychedelia, as he is as a cultural commentator, art curator, restaurateur and entrepreneur. Descended from a family of cowboys and Baptist preachers, he\u2019s part African- American, part Egyptian, part Cherokee Indian but while his heritage is all- American his global outlook, and unique way of viewing the world through the prism of contemporary music culture, transcends his Mid-Western origins.\n\nBorn in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and raised in suburban Detroit, Seth learnt the art of DJing initially from his stepfather (then a college Radio DJ) and later working behind the counter in legendary Detroit record store \u2018Melodies & Memories\u2019. It wasn\u2019t until he made the brave decision to seek new-beginnings in mid- 2000s Berlin that his DJ career really found its feet. Moving to Berlin fresh out of his teens, just as the minimal techno movement was kicking off, was the making of Seth and since then he hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nSince moving from Detroit to Berlin, and more recently London then Ibiza, ten years ago, Seth has established himself as one of underground electronic music\u2019s most iconic figures, equally at home playing to the smoke-filled dancefloors of some of the world\u2019s most discerning nightclubs, such as fabric, Nortstern, De School or Output, as he is headlining the world\u2019s largest festivals, like Glastonbury, Lowlands, Roskilde or Tomorrowlands. Right from the word go Seth has been as passionate about food and contemporary art as he is about music and these two interests have resonated at all points in parallel alongside his music career. A multi-faceted polymath: he has held residencies at talismanic music institutions such as DC10 (Ibiza), fabric (London) Trouw (Amsterdam), and Output (NYC), runs three record labels, owns a successful restaurant \u2018Smokey Tails\u2019 and is just about to unveil a new project that sits firmly at the intersection between futuristic electronica, contemporary art and technology. In 2013 he was voted number one DJ in the world in Resident Advisor\u2019s prodigious \u2018Top 100 DJs\u2019 poll. In 2016 he was member of an expedition to the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro lead by renowned Australian neurosurgeon Charlie Teo that raised over $1million for brain cancer charities.\n\n\u201cI live to work on projects and build ideas that sit at the point where art, commerce and ideas meet.

Now, with the creation of his new label, Unisex Records, and his forthcoming LP Heroin Disco, he announces himself again as one of the most original and insightful artists working in the genre. Always creating music toward the values of inclusivity, radical self-expression, the strange and uncanny, Monaco stands as a powerful and positive force against the homogeneity of mainstream dance music, asking everyone to wave their freak flags high along with him.\n\nOn Mating Call, Monaco created a series of personas to explore various facets of his personality. On his last album, Half Naked, he stripped these characters away, writing his most personal music yet. But with 2018\u2019s Heroin Disco, Monaco turns his attention outward: he explores the excesses and emptiness of contemporary America, the relationship between pleasure and self-destruction \u2014 inviting the listener at each moment to both enjoy pleasure, and wonder what is at stake in that enjoyment.

What they have inevitably divulged through their accomplishments is that when a Bay Area rave specialist and a British transplant with a classical music background come together, the resulting dynamism is no illusion. Manny Alferez and Phil Collis have artfully dedicated the focus of their wizardry to a shared passion for electronic music, and Sleight of Hands beams as a beacon of fresh disco-laden house sounds that is here to stay. Neither Manny nor Phil was a stranger to the electronic music game. Manny staked his everlasting claim in the Bay Area community in 1990 as a key promoter and DJ, roles for which he took on the abbreviated appellation of M3, short for \u201cMakes Me Move\u201d. The M3 sound began as a fluid, down-tempo approach and eventually evolved to become a funk-charged expression of house and tech-bangers for which he is so well-known today. Manny quickly developed his own legendary party brand known as Green Gorilla and progressed to sharing the decks with industry icons such as Marshall Jefferson, Derrick Carter, Cajmere, Mark Farina, and Rick James. A well-deserved social buzz led M3 to notoriety which would land him bookings across the globe; this further developed Manny\u2019s acumen for rhythm and cultural finesse, which set the stage for his bond with multifaceted performing arts crackerjack, Phil Collis. Growing up with the sounds of Beethoven, Abba and Queen meant Phil\u2019s musical destiny would be one with diverse chapters. By the early age of seven, he was already heralded a child prodigy and performing classical piano music to audiences across the UK. By the age of nine Phil was inducted into the esteemed Royal Academy of Music and by the age of twelve he had already been tapped for his acting abilities starring in roles alongside Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Liam Neeson. But it was electronic music that would truly capture his heart and he strove to achieve transition. Finally, it was at one of Collis\u2019 appearances that a deranged and confused fan unleashed a physical attack after failure to perform \u201cSussudio\u201d; this would serve as the tipping point to inspire an artistic identity change, and Phil promptly funneled his efforts into founding his first band, Bachelors of Science. Like M3, Phil\u2019s earlier approach to electronic music was a silky one, and Bachelor\u2019s of Science quickly became one of the pioneers of the \u201cliquid funk\u201d genre while experimenting with a soulful approach to drum n\u2019 bass. Upon moving to San Francisco, Phil quickly became engrossed in the captivating house beats oozing from the subwoofer that was the Bay Area, instantly pointing him to Green Gorilla and M3. When each of them realized that the other was stupidly awesome, shared visions prevailed and a collaborative enterprise was born. With best-selling remixes completed for international superstars Groove Armada and Dirty Vegas, the duo has made quite an industrious mark in a very short period of time. The impact of holding multiple #1 spots on Beatport proved prosperous, landing Sleight of Hands 2013 performance slots at world-renowned festivals such as Outside Lands and Coachella. Their magical musical approach to stylistic fusion makes listeners realize that the synergetic skills of Manny and Phil are anything but bluff. Today, relentless dedication in the studio along with a solid DJ residency at world-renowned SF nightlife staple, Monarch, continues to launch Sleight of Hands toward intergalactic success. For their next trick, they will feature a series of releases on illustrious underground record label, Smoke n\u2019 Mirrors. First in line is their premier twelve-inch EP, a trippy deep house number called \u201cAll Night\u201d, followed by \u201cSometimes\u2019 and \u201cSeal the Deal\u201d, two garage-infused chuggers with just enough grime to set off a dance floor. It can only be projected that there is plenty more mystifying amazingness to come from this enchanting doublet in the near future, so keep your ears open and your eyes sharp. Cards are officially out on the table and the stakes are high, so you\u2019d better be watching.

Stevie Coyle has a long and illustrious career as an entertainer that began well before birth and Glenn Houston's well decorated history in music is best known to berry heads for his founding role of powerhouse Americana quintet, Houston Jones. As individuals, both are renowned players in music circles. Now they have joined forces, to the delight of California audiences, to become a right-handed, right-side up fingerpicking and left-handed upside down flatpicking twosome. Mostly acoustic. Some electric. Much serendipity.\u201d\n\nSTEVIE COYLE (late of the whiz-bang string band The Waybacks) is one lucky bum. His dad ran a radio station in southern California and brought home all the promo LPs that didn't fit the Spanish-language format. The Ventures' Guitar Freakout and Alvin & The Chipmunks Play The Beatles' Hits both came home on a single fateful day.\n\nIt didn't hurt, either, that string-meister David Lindley played in a bluegrass band that rehearsed right next door and gave Stevie his very first lessons, or that his dear Granny was a pianist in the heyday of vaudeville, or that his sainted mother was a whiz in mandolin orchestras of the 1930s. Not even several years of playing Folk Masses on Sundays could quash his musical spirit.\n\nAfter securing degrees in Theatre and Theology at Santa Clara University he hit the road for 3 years with The Royal Lichtenstein Circus. Once back home, he signed on as actor / stage manager for San Jose Rep. He announced killer whale shows. His best friend was an elephant.\n\nHe and pal Roy Zimmerman have worked closely in several collaborations over the years, including folk tribute / parody band The Foremen and comedy duo The Reagan Bros. The boys were regulars at The Comedy Strore and The Improv. Stevie appeared on Cheers, in many television commercials and had a recurring role on The Young And The Restless.\n\nHey, wake up!! We're almost done.\n\nSafely back in the Bay Area, he continued his acting career, doing commercials, voiceovers and films, and played in the folk duo The Frontmen. He co-founded The Waybacks in 1999 and fronted that band through 2007. They released 4 albums in that time, played major festivals like Merlefest, Grey Fox, Floydfest and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, toured Australia and collaborated with Lloyd Maines, Michelle Shocked and Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead.\n\nStevie's gone feral and solo now. He's busily booking festivals, venues and house concerts. He's also released his first solo CD, Ten-In-One, produced by guitar guru Walter Strauss\n\nGLENN HOUSTON (nee Pomianek) has been voted Best Guitarist by the Northern California Bluegrass Society, is a past judge of the National Flatpicking Guitar Championship Competition in Winfield, Kansas, and was the founding lead guitarist of the Waybacks, co-founder and long-time lead guitarist for Bammie (Bay Area Music Award) winners Hearts on Fire, and more recently co-founder and long-time lead guitarist for the powerhouse Americana quintet Houston Jones. Most recently, Glenn has teamed up with former Waybacks band mate Stevie Coyle to form the duo \u201cThe Quitters,\u201d a mostly acoustic celebration of fingerstyle and flatpick mastery. Glenn also has recently joined Susie Glaze in performances of the quintet edition of The New Folk Ensemble.\n\nOriginally from New Jersey, Glenn\u2019s guitarist influences range from Albert King and Michael Bloomfield to Doc Watson and James Burton. These influences show in his well-balanced mastery of both acoustic and electric guitar.\n\nOver the years, Glenn has shared billing with such luminaries as Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard, the Tubes, the David Grisman Quintet, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Bela Fleck, Tim O\u2019Brien, Hank Williams Jr., Steve Earle, John Hartford, Earl Scruggs, Doc and Merle Watson, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Delbert McClinton. Glenn has been the lead guitarist for country great Johnny Paycheck, and has performed and recorded with Grammy winner Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott. With his strong background in electric blues, Glenn has performed with blues legends Mark Naftalin (Paul Butterfield Blues band) and Nick Gravenites (Electric Flag) in tribute to Mark and Nick\u2019s late band mate, blues great Michael Bloomfield.\n\nGlenn\u2019s classical music background includes choral vocal performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic (Zubin Mehta conducting, Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, at Carnegie Hall and the United Nations General Assembly [the U.N.\u2019s 25th anniversary celebration]), and the Boston Symphony (Erich Leinsdorf conducting, Brahms\u2019 Requiem, at Carnegie Hall).", "otherInfo": "Tune in to KKUP 91.5 FM or https://kkup.org/listen-online Sunday, February 16th.

But behind the geography and moniker is a band of meticulous and literary songwriters matched by a specific brand of brooding, anthem-riding balladry and orchestral indie rock. Murder By Death\u2019s path began in the early 2000s as most Midwestern college-town groups do, by playing to small crowds at ratty venues and frenzied house parties. While many of their formative-year scene-mates failed to make it much further than campustown\u2019s borders, Murder By Death translated their anonymous beginnings into a 10+ year career founded on a bedrock of five full-length albums, tireless D.I.Y. touring and performing ethics, and, most importantly, a dedicated, cult-like fanbase. Since the band began in 2001, their audience has blossomed due in part to extended tours alongside similarly hardworking musical kin such as Against Me!, Gaslight Anthem, Lucero, William Elliott Whitmore, Ha Ha Tonka, and others. Through more than 1,000 performances across the United States, Canada and Europe, Murder By Death has gained word-of-mouth devotees and support from the likes of media outlets like SPIN Magazine, who said of the band, \u201cThey brawl like Johnny Cash\u2019s cellmates or dreamily swoon like Nick [Cave], stomping saloon floorboards in 4/4 time as grand strings fade into high noon.\u201d What resonates most with supporters is the band\u2019s energetic, unique, and altogether consistent sound and conceptualized vision. The personnel and ingredients of the group consist of Sarah Balliet\u2019s throaty cello melodies, singer/guitarist Adam Turla\u2019s booming baritone vocals and brawny guitar strumming, drummer Dagan Thogerson and bassist Matt Armstrong\u2019s locked-down, post-punk rhythm section interplay, and Scott Brackett\u2019s (formerly of Okkervil River and Shearwater) multi-instrumentalist bag of tricks (including piano, trumpet, accordion, mandolin, vocals, percussion). The overriding sound is an amalgamation of textures ranging from dark and desolate to upbeat and brightly melodic, all of it landing somewhere under the orchestrated indie rock umbrella. The other mainstay signature element of Murder By Death\u2019s identity has been built by the overriding concepts behind each individual album. Every successive effort conjures up fresh imaginative and tactile worlds \u2013 whether it\u2019s the battle between the Devil and a small Western town (Who Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them?, 2003), an arid land of death and redemption (In Bocca al Lupo, 2006), or just songs inspired by a retreat into the Tennessee mountains (Good Morning, Magpie, 2010). On September 25, the band releases their newest full-length and Bloodshot Record\u2019s debut Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon. The album was written throughout 2011 in a basement in southern Indiana, and recorded in winter 2011 in Dallas, TX with producer-in-demand John Congleton (Explosions in the Sky, St Vincent, Black Mountain). \"Just remember what old Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake.

Formed by Daniel Linton and John O'Brien on the 15th anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, the group was named as a reflection of their aggressive and rebellious sound. An attitude not commonly found in Electronic Dance at the time, it differentiated them from the worldwide DJ pack. However it was taken; their approach achieved the group multiple successes early on, including becoming North American tour support for MSTRKRFT and the Bloody Beetroots in 2008. That same year they landed on the lineup of Australia\u2019s Global Gathering Festival alongside Kraftwerk, Mark Ronson and DJ Sasha, exposing them to a global audience.\n\nLA Riots have reinvented a sound that melded influences of techno, house and drum n\u2019 bass. The fans received his productions with open arms, the world took note, LA Riots had arrived. They accomplished what eludes so many in the genre; maintaining his underground credibility while remixing some of music's premier pop and rock labels. So far, the formula has worked. They have crafted the title track on Kylie Minogue\u2019s \u201cBoombox\u201d Album, remixed multi-platinum rock icons Weezer and pop-dance phenom Lady Gaga (\"Born This Way\"), all while working on top-selling Sony Playstation games. Not to mention remixing tracks for a diverse roster of DJ/artists including Tiesto, Laidback Luke and Sidney Samson.\n\nOver the years, their broad musical scope has led to plays from the likes of Tiesto, Justice and Afrojack to name a few. These accolades from fellow DJs has put him on the speed dial of A&R teams to shine up pop and rock remixes for major labels such as Warner Bros., Virgin, Tommy Boy and Interscope. LA Riots production is varied, but his quality control and precision in the studio creates a big room sound that translates the party straight to the dance floors.\n\nIt is those same high-profile productions that has prompted them to land even higher profile gigs. In 2009, they toured with The Crystal Method (\u201cDivided by Night\u201d) and a second outing with MSTRKRFT. As well as appearances at Chicago\u2019s Lollapalooza, ULTRA Music Festival in Miami (2008 & 2009), Electric Zoo, I\u2665Techno and Belgium\u2019s Pukklepop Festival. Additionally, Beatport named them as \u201cBreak Out Stars\u201d at the 2010 Winter Music Conference.\n\nTheir recent successes on the charts have been mirroring his success touring as well. Beginning the year with a #1 Billboard Remix and sold out European Tour, LA Riots returned to the Ultra Music Festival in Miami, landed a residency at XS Nightclub in Las Vegas and was featured on the 1st ever Identity Festival Tour across the US.\n\nIn 2016 LA Riots have been studio heavy releasing on Borgore\u2019s BUYGORE label with \u201cStay With Me\u201d featuring Calvin Harris vocalist Ayah Marar, \u201cFREAKS\u201d on Will Sparks Label Bourne out of Australia, a Remix of Rain Man feat Oly \u201cBring Back Summer\u201d on Steve Aoki\u2019s Dim Mak. Not to mention several more release in the works including their remix of multi-platinum songwriter Diane Warren\u2019s \u2018This Is For My Girls\u2019 charity release featuring Missy Elliott and Kelly Rowland coming out on Motown.\n\nLA Riots are definitely ones to watch and if you are lucky you might just get them to #StartARiot in your town.\n\nLA Riots Management Contact:\nzach@searchmgmt.co", "otherInfo": "Kandi Love, & PLUR Alliance present\nSO STOKED: FOR LOVE\nMain Room:\nJerome Isma-Ae In Search of Sunrise\nTour\nLA Riots\nAsian Trance Mafia\nAngel\nPsychic Monkey\nPinky and friends (Kandi Up)\nLounge:\nA.N.T.\nWilly Wonksta\nBig B\nD-Jace\nAbove DNA:\nHosted by: Mystic Ventures Collective\nFaerie Court:\nQueen Titania\nLord Oberon\nFae folk\nWitches\nImps\nChangelings\nDazzle Room:\nHosted by: Doesitbang?\nLucy Stoner\nNick Drexler\nPlease\nKenai\nGrlgod\nLove doesn't flee.

He is equally at home playing with jazz veteran Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish sean-n\u00f3s singer Roisin El Safty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata. And at heart, he is a jazz improviser.\n\nTurrisi, it\u2019s safe to say, is a musical polyglot par excellence and it\u2019s natural that he feels at home in multiple musical settings for his vocabulary is a colorful weave of early music, pan-Mediterranean modal melodies and European flavored jazz.\n\nIn spite of his numerous collaborations it\u2019s as a leader that Turrisi has earned his spurs.

Singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer, 22 year old Angel is quite possibly the UK Pop and R & B industry\u2019s best kept secret. West London bred Angel began much like many do, as a gifted child, unquenchably enthusiastic and rather uniquely, as one fifth of a family singing group along with his siblings. Known as The Charles Family, the group consisted of Angel and his siblings Tahirah, Sariah, Akelle and Kassa. The group were testament to a strong genetic musical aptitude and a passionate father who managed their early careers. The Charles Family came to prominence as a result of a BBC One documentary- One Life (2004), which followed the family\u2019s musical journey. Initially signed to Warner Music, the dynamic family group soon parted ways with the label, though by that point it was apparent that Angel had developed a thirst for making music, coupled with an undeniable talent that propelled him to go solo. Young Sirach went about experimenting with his sound, and was particularly compelled to take up producing the music, he would sing. Angel recalls, \u201cI started producing from about 10 years old, I was fascinated with music and creating it from scratch so I\u2019d use anything available to me, Atari Video Music, Cubase, it was all a case of trial and error[\u2026] it was important to me to be able to create what I was going to sing over, and laying it all down: kick, snare, strings, percussion all before I sing over it means there\u2019s a lot of heart to my music\u201d. Angel drew his main influence from his father, former manager and talented musician Tendai Charles, a professional keyboardist who accompanied an array of Reggae music talents including Bob Marley and Dennis Brown. \u201cMy dad was and still is my biggest inspiration\u201d Angel asserts, \u201cfrom a young age I saw him fulfilling his passion and the prospect of doing music everyday for the rest of my life didn\u2019t seem out of my reach.\u201d Taking it upon himself to study music in his own time, Angel took to listening to Donny Hathaway, from whose music he picked up lessons in song writing, R & B singer Brandy Norwood, whose vocal arrangements and delivery Angel would revel in, plus the record production expertise of maestros Quincey Jones and Rodney Jerkins. The study, alongside his natural gifts paid off, as Angel at just 22 now boasts the ability to write, compose and produce his songs from scratch. A talent that was identified by Universal Music who in late 2009 signed Angel to Universal Publishing as a songwriter. Angels\u2019 knack with words has seen him pen songs used by UK urban acts such as Roll Deep and Devlin, as well as him composing pop pieces for the likes of JLS and Cheryl Cole. When conceptualising his own songs, Angel draws heavily from his own experiences. Not content with making fickle music, for a throwaway culture, Angel\u2019s strength lies within his ability to make music that resonates with people\u2019s lives. \u201cI\u2019m quite the story teller\u201d he states, and nothing is more demonstrative of this perhaps than Angel\u2019s lead single off his forthcoming debut mixtape \u2018Patience Is A Virtue\u2019. This aforementioned track is Julie, an infectious, electronic driven club track, which tells the story of a relationship gone sour. Having been penned and produced entirely by Angel, he feels it\u2019s the perfect introduction to who he is as an artist. The \u2018Patience Is A Virtue\u2019 mixtape is an extended allegory of Angel\u2019s musical journey so far, from being part of his family group, through to the BBC documentaries on their lives, the continual perfecting of his craft over the years, to this point as an accomplished songwriter and musician. The first mixtape is to be followed by a second, entitled \u20187 Minutes Before Time\u2019 followed by Angel\u2019s eagerly anticipated debut album \u2018About Time\u2019. For Angel, his music is cathartic, and though he makes no claims to being a squeaky clean Pop Prince (which is underlined by the tinge of irony in his name, Angel) he aims to inspire, as Angel fondly recalls, \u201cThe nicest things anybody said about my music was that they put it on when the have a headache or feeling stressed and it always soothes the headache away, for me that\u2019s a big deal the idea of music healing pain, it can\u2019t get much better than that.\u201d www.thisisangel.com www.twitter.com/thisisangel www.youtube.com/thisisangelvevo", "otherInfo": "Kandi Love, & PLUR Alliance present\nSO STOKED: FOR LOVE\nMain Room:\nJerome Isma-Ae In Search of Sunrise\nTour\nLA Riots\nAsian Trance Mafia\nAngel\nPsychic Monkey\nPinky and friends (Kandi Up)\nLounge:\nA.N.T.\nWilly Wonksta\nBig B\nD-Jace\nAbove DNA:\nHosted by: Mystic Ventures Collective\nFaerie Court:\nQueen Titania\nLord Oberon\nFae folk\nWitches\nImps\nChangelings\nDazzle Room:\nHosted by: Doesitbang?\nLucy Stoner\nNick Drexler\nPlease\nKenai\nGrlgod\nLove doesn't flee.

Carlos Xavier is his name and singing is his game!\n\nCarlos engages his audience with his pure, passionate vocals. Backed by his band and his years of musical experience Carlos is able rise up and shine. His music has taken his groups all over the world. He has played with Los Mocosos at the East Coast Blues and Roots Festival in Australia as well as throughout the Caribbean as a cruise ship entertainer. Carlos has toured throughout the United States as well as Canada.

I made an album to make you dance, laugh, sing, cry and simply to enjoy listening to. A must for DJ\u2019s and salsa music lovers.\n\nWhen I fell in love with salsa, about 22 years ago, it became my dream to make a salsa album. Especially using the musicians and producers that made the style of salsa that I loved. I never believed it would happen but it did. With this album I plan to bring that style of salsa back that I heard many years ago and make it relevant to today, all while making it my own.\n\nI grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a melting pot of cultures so I had many genres of music in my ear. My song writing style shows that and I\u2019m very proud of it. A first generation born American to parents born in Nicaragua, my Latin roots will always be who I am, and I feel fortunate to have grown up in an era where many styles of urban music were being brought to life.

It had been over twenty years since the singer-songwriter had graduated from Montgomery Blair High School, yet his adolescent dreams, hopes, fears, anxieties and emotions the singer faced as a kid began flooding back; suddenly, the singer felt transported back into his teenage self. Growing up in suburban Maryland, Hutchinson\u2019s teenage years were filled with the type of alienation and private angst recognizable to most anyone who\u2019s ever been 16. Twenty-plus years later, the singer was finally ready to write about it.\n\nThe result: Class of 98, a 90\u2019s alt-rock-inspired autobiographical record that chronicles the singer-songwriter\u2019s adolescence.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to understand myself,\u201d Hutchinson says. \u201cWriting this record allowed me to get into the time machine and go back and look around my old life and report from my current point of view. That was fun. The problems were waiting for me: Who likes me? Why doesn\u2019t this person want to be around me? Why don\u2019t I understand myself?\u201d\n\nAfter experimenting with a series of genres like Americana/soul and jazz on his last few albums Modern Happiness and Before and After Life, the singer-songwriter turned to the pop-punk alt-rock of his youth for the riff-heavy Class of 98, taking inspiration from bands like Green Day, Oasis, and Weezer. \u201cThat music is in my guitar DNA,\u201d says the singer. \u201cI love 90\u2019s music, and this type of sound was so formative for me.\u201d To help round out his sound, Hutchinson recruited Justin Sharbono (formerly of Soul Asylum) to offer his distinctive (and period appropriate) guitar playing on the album. Hutchinson also enlisted the sonic guidance and mixing talents of Paul Kolderie, who\u2019d made great 90\u2019s records with bands like Radiohead, Hole, The Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom and The Pixies.\n\nFor Hutchinson, taking such an imaginative leap with a concept as specifically personal of Class of 98 was an artistic risk he knew he needed to take. \u201cI don\u2019t think people want me to keep making the same record, as much as anyone might think they do,\u201d he says.\n\nThe opening track \u201cRock Out Tonight\u201d sets the scene with a narrative that evokes the high-drama restlessness of a group of teenagers aimlessly driving around the suburbs in a Ford Taurus. The song, says the singer, is about \u201cwanting to be rebellious, but having no idea how to do so.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, cinematic songs like \u201cDrunk at Lunch\u201d and \u201cCooler Than You\u201d show a darker underbelly of Hutchinson\u2019s high-school introversion, echoing a theme that the singer-songwriter has been tackling in his work ever since releasing his chart-topping debut LP Sounds Like This, in 2007. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in asking questions in my songs: who\u2019s cool, who gets to decide, and where do I fit into all of that?\u201d he says.\n\nBut the emotional centerpiece of Hutchinson\u2019s latest, and the song that was the most difficult to write, is \u201cMy Old Man,\u201d written in the wake of his father\u2019s passing, after years of living with Myotonic dystrophy. More than anything else on the album, the deeply personal song gets at the album\u2019s central tension of writing from the teenage perspective while simultaneously embodying the adult point of view.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily get along with my dad in high school,\u201d says the singer. \u201cWe were in different places in our lives and he had different things to worry about. I tried to sing this song from my perspective back then as well as my perspective now, where I\u2019ve made peace with him.\u201d\n\nTaken as a whole, Class of 98 arrives as Hutchinson\u2019s most playful yet distinctive work, one that will surely resonate with longtime fans of the singer\u2019s pop-rock hits like \u201cRock & Roll,\u201d \u201cTell the World,\u201d and \u201cWatching You Watch Him.\u201d For Hutchinson, the experience of delving back into his high school youth helped him learn a lot: about his upbringing, about parenthood, and about himself.\n\n\u201cI like the 90\u2019s way better,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I\u2019m not living in them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Jose, CA", "Artist": "Keak da Sneak", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.8261, 37.2751], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Back Bar SoFA", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors: 8:00 pm / Show: 8:30 pm, 21+ Event"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Saintseneca", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8747480.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Alternative, Indie Rock, Indie Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "Saintseneca's Zac Little has been thinking a lot about memory. Not necessarily his memories, though they creep in often, too. Rather, he mulls over the idea of memory itself: its resilience, its haziness, how it slips away as we try to hang on, the way it resurfaces despite our best efforts to forget.\n\nMemory is the common thread running throughout the Columbus folk-punk band's fourth album, Pillar of Na, arriving in August 31st via ANTI- Records. Following 2015's critically lauded Such Things, the new album's name is rooted in remembrance, referencing the Genesis story of Lot's wife who looks back at a burning Sodom after God instructs her not to. She looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. \"Na,\" meanwhile, is the chemical symbol for sodium. \"Nah\" is a passive refusal and the universal song word. It means nothing and stands for nothing. It is \"as it is.\"\n\nLike Lot's wife, Little cannot help but revisit where-and how-he grew up. Raised in church in southeastern Appalachian Ohio, he took up preaching when he was still a teenager, sometimes in small country settings and other times to congregations of thousands. But these days he's more interested in listening. And questioning.\n\nMusically, Pillar of Na is Saintseneca's most ambitious album to date, with Little aiming to incorporate genre elements he'd rarely heard in folk. \"I wanted to use the idiom of folk-rock, or whatever you want to call it, and to try to do something that had never been done before,\" Little explains. \"To reach way back, echoing ancient folk melodies, tie that into punk rock, and then push it into the future. I told Mike Mogis I wanted Violent Femmes meets the new Blade Runner soundtrack. I'm looking for the intersection between Kendrick Lamar and The Fairport Convention.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2700 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Little Miss Nasty", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8930161.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413521, 37.765699], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Metal, Classic Rock, Punk, Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Jolene\u2019s Bar and Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "The Drop Dead Foxes of Rock & Roll \u201cLittle Miss Nasty\u201d have been taking the nation by storm!\n\nThese feisty Sex Kittens have been busy leaving their mark on stages across the entire country along with continuously Sold Out shows at ongoing West Coast Residencies in several cities.\n\nNothing can stop these Badass Babes on a mission.

Like most successful artists, he comes from humble beginnings. Raised in the farming community of Prickly Pole, just a few miles from the home where Bob Marley grew in Nine Mile, he spent most of his childhood farming alongside his father and four siblings. As a young child he played music on handmade instruments crafted together from bamboo and sardine tins, only getting the chance to try out proper instruments in church when someone with a real guitar would finally set it down. Realizing her brother\u2019s love for music, his sister with combined efforts from their mother, saved her money to buy him his first guitar. For high school he moved from the country to St. Ann\u2019s Bay, where he lived on the same street as Burning Spear, and enlisted in the Ocho Rios High School band. They came second in the All Schools Competition in Kingston, giving him the confidence to move to the city to pursue music.\nIt was his move to Kingston in 1992 that began his musical career. Rarely seen without carrying his guitar, he was given the nickname Danny Gitz. Along with the name, his skill and reputation as an outstanding guitarist began to grow. During the early nineties the legendary Sugar Minott took him under his wing where he eventually became Sugar\u2019s band leader. I-taweh attributes Sugar to making him the musician he is today- \u201cSugar was like a father to me. He was the roughest, but at the same time the kindest, sweetest person. On stage he would let you know in front of thousands of people if you were messing up, but at the same time when you had it he always let us know too and made you feel good. He had a real sense of pride in his music and he was the first real reggae star who as a youth made we feel we were good enough. No matter how good you are, if you don\u2019t get the chance to show it \u2013 what can you do? He was one of the first people who made me believe in myself as a serious musician.\u201d\nIn 1994 he became part of the band High Symbol and after a tour landed in Australia with them. It was in in Australia that I-taweh began singing lead vocals here and there, and gaining some confidence as a front man. In 1998 I-taweh became the youngest member of Count Ossie\u2019s original Nyabhingi group, Mystic Revelation of Rastafari. Until 2007 he extensively toured Europe with the group where they are well known for their traditional Jamaican folk music and workshops which they held at Universities. In France, he began collaboration with reggae group Broussai which led to studio sessions in hotel rooms and the beginnings of tracks that he later used on his first album Overload.\nNot only was I-taweh in demand for live performances, his incredible versatility and precision on guitar and bass kept him in high demand in the studio as well. During the 90\u2019s he recorded with artists such as: Sade, Capleton, Morgan Heritage, Sugar Minott, Luciano, Lenky Roy, and Iqulah.\nIt was with Everton Blender, as the guitarist for the Blend Dem Band, that he came to the U.S. during 2004. After the tour, he went on to be the bassist for the Yellow Wall Dub Squad, a major backing band for Jamaican artists in the U.S. Billed as Itawe and often referred to as the Reggae Lion, he quickly gained popularity as the singing bassist opening for artists such as Sister Carol, Prezident Brown, the Abyssinians, Yami Bolo, Half Pint, the Mighty Diamonds, and the Melodians.\nIn 2009, after 17 years of being a supporting musician, I-taweh took a hiatus from the road and began to pursue his solo album. In 2011 he released his independently composed, written, and produced first album named Overload under his own label Tap Nat MuziK. In December 2011 I-taweh performed songs from his debut release at his launch party at Wickie Wackie in Bull Bay, Jamaica, as part of a great journey through Jamaica's radio and media landscape. I-taweh formed the band the Reggae Lions for the launch event enlisting veterans Nambo Robinson on trombone along with Everton Gayle on saxophone and Time aka Count Ossie Jr. on percussion. Selections from the Overload album and the Overload single have received significant airplay on numerous stations in Jamaica and both have become a 2011-2012 hit, reaching #1 on the Hot 102 FM chart. In the U.S., the Overload album has been very well-received at traditional reggae radio, college and syndicated programs and was selected to be part of the Direct TV cable network's menu of reggae material where several songs are in regular rotation. There has been considerable attention at radio and TV for Overload and the song has become popular with people of all ages.\nWith his all-star band, the Reggae Lions, he is currently touring and captivating audiences all over the world with his moving lyrics, confident stage presence, and phenomenal talent. I-taweh\u2019s unique and original sound comes from his Jamaican roots influence combined with inspirations from his travels abroad. His music is diverse and reflects his passion for Human Rights and Social Justice. Whether performing acoustic guitar with a stand- up bass, or with his full ten piece band, he is quickly winning the hearts of his listeners everywhere and continuously leaves his audience wanting more!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Kelley Stoltz", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Alternative, Indie, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ezra Furman"}, {"Address": "2500 Embarcadero, Oakland, CA 94606", "Artist": "Los Nuevos Cadetes", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.23782, 37.77517], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Just Dance Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2500 Embarcadero, Oakland, CA 94606", "Artist": "Grupo Bahia", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.23782, 37.77517], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Just Dance Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1419 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Bohemian Knuckle Boogie", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433317, 37.782618], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Sheba Piano Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Bohemian Knuckleboogie at Sheba Piano Lounge: Don't let the hokey exterior fool you, this place offers a comfortable, even classy setting in the heart of the Fillmore.

Sounds pretty unpromising don't it? Especially in an era in Hop-Hop where your success is determined off of who you know instead of what your talent can actually offer. It could at times seem impossible, I mean..where would you start? Most people would lose confidence, fold under pressure, be easily misguided or simply give up. Not in this case.\n\nBorn Shaunrick Sims on March 3 in the central valley of California, Hip-Hop Artist/Song Writer/Producer/Actor/ Priceless Da ROC (or simply known as Priceless) moved back and forth between Jamaica Queens, NY and Lompoc, CA until his stepfather received military orders to move to Washington, DC. Moving from state to state introduced Priceless to new cultures, lifestyles, different genres of music and also forced him to meet new people and make new friends, which ultimately helped his communication skills.\n\nImmediately after graduating from High School, Priceless moved back to California in hope of starting a rap career in Los Angeles. After only a year of being there, Priceless got wrapped up in gang activity, drugs, women, robberies and eventually was homeless. Dropping to under 100 pounds, sleeping outside, bouncing from trap house to trap house in hope of finding a place to stay for the night, Priceless realizing this wasn't the path he wanted to take his life, flew back to Washington DC.\n\nAfter a year of working, getting his act together, learning how to mix, master and produce his own music, Priceless figured it was time to give California another shot, this time to San Francisco. Within his first 3 years of moving to SF, Priceless was featured on MTV2, was apart of the bay area's popular underground \"Team Backpack Cyphers\", produced for Def Jam Recording artist Juelz Santana (Track Tittle \"King Of New York\") was the first artist from San Francisco to become the Freestyle Friday Champion on BET's 106&Park, was announced on the top 10 \"Bay Area Freshmen Of The Year\" list in 2012 as well as helping land the #1 record of the year spot on 106.1 Kmel in San Francisco for top 100 songs on 2012 in the bay area (Slow Down, With Clyde Carson) and most notably.. Creating the popular J12 dance and Gas Paddle wich then spiraled into the new style of dancing & culture in the bay area known as \"Gettin Saucy\",\n\nWith millions of views on YouTube, throwing the wildest parties in the bay area (which are known to reach capacity), Priceless Da ROC is not only showing he is diverse by making hit club songs, R&B tracks, spitting high energy punchlines in battles/cyphers around the world, he's also showing that with hard work and determination anything is possible. Now, representing for the bay area as one of the brightest up-and coming stars, Priceless is showing that he has no signs of slowing down and that its safe to say..this time.. he's here to stay.", "otherInfo": "\"THE BAY VS LA \" BIGGEST COLLEGE PARTY OF THE YEAR!"}, {"Address": "2344 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Bigtop", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/286448.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.434294, 37.763629], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Beaux", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Big Top\" at Beaux:"}, {"Address": "5104 Hopyard Rd, Pleasanton, CA 94588", "Artist": "The SOULKorean Comedian", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9117674.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.905155, 37.698093], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Spoken, karoake, ted talk", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Tommy T's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Eric Shun The SOUL Korean Comedian tells his story as a Stand-Up Comedian.

Everything you leave behind opens up space for something new in your life.\u201d\n\nThat was certainly the case with Little\u2019s remarkable new album, \u2018aloha.\u2019 Written in only eight days and recorded at Paris\u2019s iconic Studio Ferber, the entire project was an exercise in letting go, in ceding control, in surrendering to fate. While Little still plays nearly every instrument on the album himself, he put his songs in the hands of an outside producer for the first time here, collaborating with French studio wizard Renaud Letang (Feist, Manu Chao) to create his boldest, most self-assured statement yet.\n\nEqual parts vintage and modern, the collection blends classic soul, old-school R&B, and adventurous indie sensibilities into a timeless swirl fueled by gritty instrumental virtuosity and raw, raspy vocals. It\u2019s an ambitious work of vision and reflection, to be sure, but more than that, it\u2019s an ecstatic testament to the freedom that comes from torching the map and trusting the currents of life to carry you where you belong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always produced myself in the past,\u201d explains Little, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to get caught up in an endless quest for perfection when you do that. Working with Renaud let me see my work from an outsider\u2019s perspective, and that helped me get out of my own way.\u201d\n\nBorn Aaron Earl Livingston to a preacher and a teacher in Los Angeles, Little first came to international prominence with his self-titled debut, released in 2015 on ANTI- Records. While Little\u2019s collaborations with The Roots and RJD2 had already helped him make a name for himself by that point in his adopted hometown of Philadelphia, critics on both sides of the pond were quick to recognize the unique power of Little\u2019s solo recordings, which stripped the past for parts that could be reconstituted into something wholly new and original. NPR hailed Little\u2019s \u201cimpeccably crafted songs\u201d as \u201chonest and unpretentious,\u201d while The Independent proclaimed him \u201ca formidable talent,\u201d and Vice declared that he was \u201cdissolving the barrier between R&B and rock 'n' roll one tearjerker at a time.\u201d\n\nSongs from the record racked up roughly 30 million streams on Spotify alone, and the album landed Little dates with everyone from Leon Bridges and Kelis to Shakey Graves and Mumford & Sons alongside festival appearances at Bonnaroo, Newport Folk, and more. Never one to rest on his laurels, Little showed off his production chops the following year, earning a GRAMMY Award for his work helming Mavis Staples\u2019 acclaimed \u2018See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,\u2019 and in 2017, he released a critically lauded sophomore album, \u2018New Magic,\u2019 which Paste said \u201cdid for the blues what Sharon Jones did for soul music.\u201d\n\nBy now, it\u2019s probably clear that Son Little likes to keep busy. In order to create \u2018aloha,\u2019 though, Little knew he\u2019d have to do the unthinkable: sit still. The next thing Little had to let go of was even more challenging. Just weeks before he was set to begin assembling the album demos in Petaluma, California, his hard drive fried, taking with it nearly a dozen detailed demos for new songs. For a meticulous planner like Little, it was a devastating blow, one that left him with no choice but to start over.\n\n\u201cLosing all that material felt like a nightmare at the time, but I\u2019ve since learned to see it as an opportunity,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t lost all those songs, I never would have written all the new stuff that became \u2018aloha.\u2019\u201d\n\nBeginning again with what was essentially a blank slate, Little penned much of the new album in Petaluma, in a tiny house and it\u2019s adjacent barn. He let the songs take him on a journey of self-exploration there, examining the kind of big-picture questions that emerged from his subconscious in the quiet stillness: What am I doing? How did I get here? Who do I really want to be?\n\n\u201cI let the dust settle after a hectic year, and stopped worrying about the music for a minute,\u201d explains Little. \u201cI tried to just tune in to what was happening in my mind, to just be present in my body. It was liberating.\u201d\n\nThat sense of liberation is clear from the very beginning of \u2018aloha,\u2019 with album opener \u201chey rose\u201d showcasing Little\u2019s freewheeling way with words and lean, swaggering delivery. Inspired by the sense of infatuation that comes with new love, the track sets the stage for an album full of unflinching self-examination and daring sonic fusion. Little injects trippy psychedelia into Sam Cooke soul on the slow-burning \u201cabout her. again.,\u201d channels Prince and Michael Jackson on the breezy \u201c3rd eye weeping,\u201d and marries sparse, distorted guitar tones with clean, dense vocal harmonies on the infectious \u201cmahalia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat song\u2019s an apology delivered at the start of a relationship, instead of the end, when it all falls apart\u201d says Little, who often collapses time and space in his writing by combining characters and scenes from throughout his life. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking a lot about how I find myself repeating the same mistakes in different areas of my life. I find myself drawn over and over to the same qualities in different people, and sometimes the dynamic can become toxic. Pointing the finger is easy. I\u2019m trying to be better at acknowledging my part of the problem.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the power of our own self-destructive tendencies is a recurring theme on \u2018aloha.\u2019 Little mourns the suicide of a beloved uncle on \u2018suffer\u2019, using addiction and mental illness as a lens to explore forgiveness and empathy, laments the rapidly deteriorating world his two children are set to inherit on \u2018o clever one,\u2019 and meditates on the dangers of succumbing to passion at the expense of reason on \u201cbelladonna.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lightness that comes from being so deeply in love with a person or an idea,\u201d says Little. \u201cBut there\u2019s a danger that comes with it, too. It\u2019s like a drug: a little bit and you feel incredible; too much and it kills you.\u201d\n\nIt would be easy to feel helpless in the face of such inexorable forces, to feel as if we are prisoners of fate rather than masters of our own destiny, but Little instead finds peace in perseverance on the album. \u201cHallelujah,\u201d he sings on the gorgeous \u2018neve give up,\u2019 \u201cthough I\u2019m battered and blue / feel like I\u2019m born to lose\u2026Never will I give up.\u201d\n\nIt is a potent reminder that letting go doesn\u2019t mean giving in; in fact, quite the opposite. Letting go can be an act of defiance, of growth, of empowerment. Letting go requires a leap of faith, and, in Son Little\u2019s case, that faith has been richly rewarded. Whether that means this album represents the end of one chapter or the beginning of the next is impossible to know just yet, but in either case, there\u2019s really only one thing to say: aloha.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always produced myself in the past,\u201d explains Little, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to get caught up in an endless quest for perfection when you do that. Working with Renaud let me see what I was doing from an outsider\u2019s perspective, let me see the songs from a bird\u2019s-eye view.

While Little had already made a name for himself in his adopted hometown of Philadelphia for his collaborations with hip-hop legends The Roots and electronic pioneer RJD2, critics on both sides of the pond were quick to recognize the unique power of his solo recordings. They didn\u2019t simply revive sounds from the past, but rather stripped them for parts and reconstituted them into something wholly new and original. NPR hailed Little\u2019s \u201cimpeccably crafted songs\u201d as \u201chonest and unpretentious,\u201d while The Independent proclaimed him \u201ca formidable talent,\u201d and Vice declared that he was \u201cdissolving the barrier between R&B and rock 'n' roll one tearjerker at a time.\u201d\n\nSongs from the record racked up roughly 30 million streams on Spotify alone, and the album landed Little dates with everyone from Leon Bridges and Kelis to Shakey Graves and Mumford & Sons alongside festival appearances at Bonnaroo, Newport Folk, and more. Never one to rest on his laurels, Little showed off his production chops the following year, earning a GRAMMY Award for his work helming Mavis Staples\u2019 acclaimed \u2018See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,\u2019 and in 2017, he released a critically lauded sophomore album, \u2018New Magic,\u2019 which Paste raved \u201cdid for the blues what Sharon Jones did for soul music.\u201d Little hit the road for dates with Dr. Dog and X Ambassadors behind the record in addition to crisscrossing the country for extensive headline touring (much of it featuring Jade Bird as support) and festival performances at Hangout, Sasquatch, and Pilgrimage among others.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Balto", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9837109.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Mon Feb 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-17", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Alt Country, Folk Rock, Rocknroll, Roots Rock, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "\"Balto sound like the kind of band you\u2019d want playing in the background as you cruise down the highway with a road soda clutched in your hand.\" - What Youth\n\nBalto plays unbridled American Rock and Roll - steeped in both the mythology of the great folk storytellers and the legendary Motown groovers.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world.

Enormous worm-like creatures burrow through the Vale and often carry with them helpless victims, where they are left to die. Vale Of Pnath is a five-piece extreme metal band from Denver, CO originally formed in 2006 by guitarist Vance Valenzuela, bassist Alan Paredes, drummer Jeremy Portz and vocalist David Lercher. Guitar virtuoso Mikey Reeves-Juarez joined the lineup and two years later the band recorded a blistering 4-track EP with Dave Otero (Cattle Decapitation, Cephalic Carnage, Allegaeon) where upon it\u2019s self-release was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews within the technical and melodic death metal community. In 2009, Tribunal Records reached out to the band and re-released the self-titled EP. In 2010, Ken Sarafin (Sarafin Concepts) takes over on vocal duties and the band signs with Willowtip Records. \u201cThe Prodigal Empire\u201d was released worldwide in 2011 with massive outpouring of support from the tech death community. The band began to develop a following as they regularly gigged locally and regionally before Ken had to step down, unable to commit to touring as he was focused on his career in art & graphic design. Enter longtime friend of the band Stevie Boiser (Calculating Genocide, Dissonance In Design) and new full-time drummer Eric W. Brown (Inferi, Destroyx3, Swashbuckle). The band embarks on several tours throughout the US supporting acts such as Vital Remains, Gorod, Abiotic and Enfold Darkness. Mikey left the band in 2014 and was replaced briefly by the prodigious Harrison Patuto (Dissonance In Design), before Harrison needed to leave the band world to concentrate on other efforts. Stevie also said good-bye to shift his focus elsewhere, leaving a void in the Pnath and open positions for both guitar and vocals. Eloy Montes (Flub) fills the spot on guitar, and fresh blood Reece Deeter (Apotheon) shows up in the nick of time to offer his vocal talents and willingness to adapt to new surroundings. In December 2015, Vale Of Pnath heads back over to Flatline Audio to record the second-full length effort with Dave Otero. \u201cVale Of Pnath II\u201d is the band\u2019s most melodic and technical effort yet, and thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign, will be released on June 2016 via Willowtip Records.

Native from Bordeaux, France, GOROD released 5 albums and 2 EP who were, for each one, warmly welcomed by fans and music medias around the world, that gave the band this current fame. GOROD is a real live act, showing impressive instruments skills and ultimate precision on stage. The band toured Europe several times with top-notch international acts (Morbid Angel, Obscura, The Faceless, Cattle Decapitation, Immolation, Job For a Cowboy, Havoc, etc), played 2 times at Hellfest, crushed the stage at Summer Breeze OA and Brutal Assault OA, toured the USA where they played 2 times at the mighty Maryland Deathfest, and travelled there for a month as headliner of the Bloodletting North America Tour in 2013 and also toured Canada for four weeks in 2016. It\u2019s appearance to the biggest metal festival in South East Asia, Jakarta Hammersonnic International Festival and a Japanese Tour definitely contributed to set the band as an impressive and respected live act. \"A Perfect Absolution\" (2012) is regarded as the band's masterpiece to this day showing GOROD at the top of their game. The album was voted as best French metal album of the year in France in N\u00b01 french webzine \"VS Webzine\". \"A Maze of Recycled Creeds\", October 16th 2015, received impressive reviews.

Six virtuosic voices united in crystal clear harmony, against a backdrop of syncopated rhythms, innovative arrangements, and funky grooves that bubble into an intoxicating brew of gospel, jazz, R&B, and pop. With praise from such luminaries as Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Brian Wilson, Ella Fitzgerald and Whitney Houston, the multi-platinum selling sextet has toured across the globe, collaborated across genres, and is recognized as the pre-eminent a capella group in the world.\n\n\n\nWith the popularity of televised vocal competitions such as the explosive a cappella show The Sing Off and the mania over singing driven comedy-dramas like Glee and Smash, Take 6 is the original torchbearer. Two major recent events reminded everyone of this as Take 6 triumphed among a gathering of stars including Celine Dion, Lionel Richie, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Nicks, Ne-Yo, and more. At Walmart's 50th Anniversary celebration, Take 6 captivated the audience with their rendition of the Louis Armstrong hit, What A Wonderful World. Showing the global reach of this phenomenal group, Take 6 closed the show with Ladysmith Black Mambazo to a standing ovation! Two weeks later at the behest of legendary Producer Phil Ramone, Take 6 thrilled a sold-out audience at the Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards performing with and honoring legendary singer-songwriter Ben E. King on his classic \"Stand By Me.\" As a group that knows no musical bounds, they then brought the house down with their tribute to folk icon Woody Guthrie with This Land Is Your Land.\n\n\n\nTake 6 has come a long way from their days at Huntsville, Alabama's Oakwood College where McKnight formed the group as The Gentleman's Estate Quartet in 1980. When tenor Mark Kibble heard the group rehearsing in the dorm bathroom, he joined in the harmonies and performed on stage that night. When Mervyn Warren joined shortly afterward, they took the name Alliance. Yet, when they signed to Reprise Records/Warner Bros. in 1987, they found that there was another group with the same name, so they became Take 6. Says McKnight: \"Take 6 was all about a democratic process of sitting in a room together and throwing a couple of hundred names at each other and Take 6 was the one that got the most yay votes [laughing.] It pretty much was a play on the Take 5 jazz standard and the fact that there are six of us in the group, so it became Take 6.\" Their self-titled debut CD won over jazz and pop critics, scored two 1988 Grammy Awards, landed in the Top Ten Billboard Contemporary Jazz and Contemporary Christian Charts, and they've never slowed down.\n\n\n\nWhat makes the music and the group last this long? The answers are direct and simple: faith, friendship, respect, and love of music. Such qualities garnered them awards beyond musical category - a Soul Train Award and two NAACP Image Award nominations. From their exceptional live performances to their recordings, these qualities remain at the heart of the Take 6 phenomenon.\n\n\n\nOne, Take 6's recent recording on Shanachie, is notable for three reasons. First, it's the group's return to their spiritual heritage. Second, it is their first project without Cedric Dent, who retired from full-time touring with the group last year. \"Cedric had taken a position with MTSU (Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, TN) which didn't allow him to go out on the road during the school year and kind of limited him only to the weekends and that's if it worked for the schedule,\" says Kibble. \"So we decided it was best to find a person to step in and cover him when he couldn't be there. Third, it introduces Khristian Dentley as a full-time permanent member of Take 6. Kibble continues, \"We actually had a pool of three people we used over the years. Khristian was one of those people called on to step in. He did it beautifully and had a lot of energy. In standing in for Cedric, we were able to learn his personality and he was able to learn the music. After 7 years, Cedric decided to go full time into academia and when he did, Khristian was already primed to step in behind him.\"\n\n\n\nAs Take 6 celebrates their 25th Anniversary with a brand new show, they'll share the memories in the music of the past 25 years as well as reveal what the future holds!\n\n\n\nFor more information visit: http://www.take6.com", "otherInfo": "Georgia on My Mind: The Music of Ray Charles"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Joep Beving", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9717431.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: Neo-Classical, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "On April 7 Joep Beving's second album called \"Prehension\" will be released worldwide under the Deutsche Grammophon label.\n\n\n\n\u201cSolipsism\u201d is the debut album of composer and pianist Joep Beving. The title refers to the philosophical idea that reality only exists in one\u2019s mind. Everything outside of it, the external world and the minds of others, cannot truly be known and hence does not exist. Beving\u2019s music is an experiment in existential communication, a belief in an absolute aesthetic, to prove that a universal and metaphysical reality does exist.\n\n\n\nBeving has been one with the piano from an early age. He was forced to end his musical studies at the conservatory and instead continued at university to get a degree in social sciences. However, his love for his instrument never perished. Where once his goal was to hit as many notes per minute as physically possible, his style of playing has changed over the years, searching for a particular aesthetic essence. His path was illuminated by a piano that Beving inherited from his grandmother when she passed away in 2009. This German instrument insisted on a more gentle touch and a gracious pace, which eventually led Beving to adapt to a more classical vocabulary to tell his story.\n\n\n\nJoep Beving is a composer and musician, but to the international advertising community he is mostly known as the face of music agency MassiveMusic. After having worked on numerous national and international commercials over the past 10 years, it is time for Beving to let the music speak for himself. In the past year he has composed and recorded his first solo album at home in the still of night. The album is filled with introspective and often filmic piano compositions. Music stripped to its bare essentials, representing a quest for essence and beauty. His album titled \u201cSolipsism\u201d will be launched on Thursday the 19th of March, in the presence of a select audience in a unique location in the centre of Amsterdam.\n\n\n\nThe production and release of the album (digital & vinyl) was completely independent.

The versatile songstress quickly followed that with a third stunning turn, this time with The World Famous Count Basie Orchestra to celebrate their new Mack Avenue recording on which she can be heard. Concord Records will release a new recording by Freelon \u2013 her first brand new recording in four years! Most recently, Freelon could be heard returning to television: the Emmy-Award winning show Mad Men featured Freelon\u2019s voice on their Oct. 11, 2009 episode and Freelon made a touching appearance with trumpet-legend Clark Terry on In Performance At The White House to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. At the 43rd annual GRAMMY Awards telecast from Los Angeles, she inspired an enthusiastic standing ovation from 20,000 music-industry insiders and celebrities when she took to the stage. Prior to that stirring appearance, Freelon\u2019s performances for the legendary Julie Andrews at the Society of Singers\u2019 \u201cElla Awards,\u201d Variety\u2019s The Children\u2019s Charity (as a featured vocalist at the Stephen Sondheim Tribute at Carnegie Hall), Jerry Lewis\u2019 Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy Telethon and at the most famous jazz festivals around the globe have all been rousing successes. No wonder\u2014for anyone who has heard and seen Freelon sing knows she is a skillful interpreter of even the most familiar chestnuts. Concord Records released two Freelon-centered recordings in 2008, the first entitled \u201cBetter Than Anything: The Quintessential Nnenna Freelon\u201d celebrating her ever-expanding appeal and artistry; and the second recording \u201cThe Monterey Jazz Festival 50th Anniversary All Stars,\u201d featuring Freelon in spectacular duets and group performances with Terrence Blanchard and James Moody. On her Grammy-nominated (for Best Jazz Vocal Performance) release, \u201cBlueprint Of A Lady: Sketches of Billie Holiday\u201d (2005), Freelon paid tribute to the quintessential jazz vocalist Billie Holiday. As inventive as ever, Freelon turned these Holiday-associated songs and fulfilled Billie Holiday\u2019s message to all artists: \u201cNo two people on earth are alike, and it\u2019s got to be that way with music or it isn\u2019t music.\u201d With her own band, and with Ronald K. Brown & his dance troupe EVIDENCE, Freelon turned this into a multi-media music and dance offering unlike any show previously seen! Freelon is a winner of both the Billie Holiday Award from the prestigious Academie du Jazz and the Eubie Blake Award from the Cultural Crossroads Center in New York City. Born and raised in Cambridge, MA, educated in Boston at Simmons College, Freelon grew up on the sounds of music in the church and of jazz, especially big band music, courtesy of her father. Recently Freelon has teamed up with the World Famous Count Basie Orchestra, creating new music, new arrangements, and a new standard of big band vocalizing founded on musical genius, sensitive melodic renderings, and powerhouse swing. Freelon tips her hat to the fantastic vocalists who have performed with the orchestra, including Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn, adding to the scintillating Basie sounds in the new material designed and arranged for her unique style. Freelon is renowned leader in the education and healthcare fields, has served as National Spokesperson for Partners in Education, and conducts workshops, clinics, and master classes. Her workshops, from \u201cSound Sculpture\u201d to the groundbreaking \u201cBabysong,\u201d teach adults and children that you too can change the world \u2013 even one person at a time \u2013 but it takes dedication and perseverance, the substance of Freelon\u2019s educational activities. The messages in Freelon\u2019s activities go far beyond technique; they reach into the very soul of the person listening and encourage, in fact motivate, them toward constructive change and the creation of positive energy. \"Be sure to check out Nnenna Freelon... very hip music\" - Aretha Franklin", "otherInfo": "Georgia on My Mind: The Music of Ray Charles"}, {"Address": "427 Mendocino Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95401", "Artist": "David J (Official)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9911684.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.715214, 38.441851], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: Goth, Folk, Acoustic, Jazz, Avant Garde, Rock, Alternative, Blues", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Lost Church -", "moreBioInfo": "www.davidjonline.com\nwww.bauhausmusik.com\nhttps://www.patreon.com/davidj", "otherInfo": "David J (Bauhaus, Love and Rockets) will be playing select dates in support of his new album 'Missive To An Angel From The Halls Of Infamy And Allure', a highly ambitious and intensely personal, self deprecating, confessional song cycle, which he sees as a culmination of everything he has created thus far.

Internationally recognized trumpet player and composer-producer-entrepreneur Dan Rosenboom embraces the chaos and seeks to endow us with hope and joy along the way.\n\nRosenboom, a musician at the forefront of Los Angeles' ever-thriving creative music scene, boasts an international reputation for boundary-pushing projects and relentless productivity. A trumpet virtuoso equally at home in improvised and classical music, the prolific musician has been featured on stages and festivals all over the world, and has been described as \u201ca phenomenon\u201d by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe highly decorated Rosenboom was born on May 7, 1982 in Berkeley, CA to a composer-performer father who was a trailblazer of early computer music and a mother who was an avant- garde vocalist, designer, and visual artist. From these roots, Rosenboom developed an approach to music and trumpet playing that is highly personalized yet grounded in a global and forward-thinking sensibility.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, I was surrounded by people who were examining and redefining what we consider art to be,\u201d Rosenboom said. \u201cThat has had a lasting impact on me, and gave me a true and deep love of exploration through the artistic creative process.\u201d\n\nEarly on, the musician also acquired an interest in music that reflects cultural and social movements. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was always interested in music inspired by what was happening in the world at large,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s become an ongoing theme in my music: responding to culture.\u201d\n\nRosenboom\u2019s explorations into avant-garde music and what he calls \u201cthe intersection of intellectualism and spirituality\u201d deepened while he earned an undergraduate degree at the prestigious Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY in 2004, and graduate degrees at UCLA and California Institute of the Arts in 2006 and 2007, respectively.\n\nIt was at the latter institutions that his love for improvisational music permanently took root, and around that time he entered Los Angeles\u2019 creative music scene. Working closely with LA icon Vinny Golia, and with his own Balkan jazz-rock group PLOTZ, and improv band DR. MiNT, as well as many other projects, Rosenboom\u2019s route into the jazz world was circuitous, to say the least. However, over the last decade, he\u2019s solidified his place as a pillar in LA\u2019s music community, and has produced more than 25 albums, both under his own name and with various bands.

As a bandleader, he has brought his music to such renowned festivals as the Monterey Jazz Festival, Angel City Jazz Festival, Jazzfestival Saalfelden and Jazz em Agosto.\n\nAs a Hollywood studio recording artist, he has worked with such notable film composers as John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Alan Silvestri, Danny Elfman, Alexandre Desplat, James Newton Howard, and many more. Moreover, Rosenboom has performed with many of the elite classical music groups in Los Angeles, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Los Angeles Opera, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Monday Evening Concerts, Southwest Chamber Music, the Long Beach Opera, and has toured as principal trumpet of the Dallas Brass, and as pop superstar Josh Groban\u2019s trumpet soloist.\n\nThroughout Rosenboom\u2019s myriad pursuits, he has always maintained a sense of optimism and possibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever experienced hopelessness as an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to maintain a sense of hope even when things are very dark - I\u2019ve always turned to art and music as a respite from all that.\u201d\n\nWith that said, Rosenboom\u2019s protest band Burning Ghosts tackles socio-political concerns head on.

Featuring an astounding lineup of heavy hitters and young firebrands, this is cutting-edge, electro-acoustic, high-octane conceptual jazz at its finest.\n\nDan Rosenboom - Cornet, Trumpet, Compositions\nGavin Templeton - Saxophone\nJake Vossler - Guitar\nJerry Watts, Jr. - Bass\nGary Novak - Drums\n\nwww.danrosenboom.com\n\n\u201cA singularly creative voice whose unique aesthetic encompasses an array of idiosyncratic influences...a lyrical virtuoso with a commanding tone, whose expansive trumpet technique is saliently paralleled in his diverse writing...an artist on the rise.\u201d\n\u2013Troy Collins, All About Jazz\n\nIn a time marked by unpredictability and absurd realities, music imbued with spontaneity and improvisation seems especially relevant. Internationally recognized trumpet player and composer-producer-entrepreneur Dan Rosenboom embraces the chaos and seeks to endow us with hope and joy along the way.\n\nRosenboom, a musician at the forefront of Los Angeles' ever-thriving creative music scene, boasts an international reputation for boundary-pushing projects and relentless productivity. A trumpet virtuoso equally at home in improvised and classical music, the prolific musician has been featured on stages and festivals all over the world, and has been described as \u201ca phenomenon\u201d by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe highly decorated Rosenboom was born on May 7, 1982 in Berkeley, CA to a composer-performer father who was a trailblazer of early computer music and a mother who was an avant-garde vocalist, designer, and visual artist. From these roots, Rosenboom developed an approach to music and trumpet playing that is highly personalized yet grounded in a global and forward-thinking sensibility.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, I was surrounded by people who were examining and redefining what we consider art to be,\u201d Rosenboom said. \u201cThat has had a lasting impact on me, and gave me a true and deep love of exploration through the artistic creative process.\u201d\n\nEarly on, the musician also acquired an interest in music that reflects cultural and social movements. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was always interested in music inspired by what was happening in the world at large,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s become an ongoing theme in my music: responding to culture.\u201d\n\nRosenboom\u2019s explorations into avant-garde music and what he calls \u201cthe intersection of intellectualism and spirituality\u201d deepened while he earned an undergraduate degree at the prestigious Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY in 2004, and graduate degrees at UCLA and California Institute of the Arts in 2006 and 2007, respectively.\n\nIt was at the latter institutions that his love for improvisational music permanently took root, and around that time he entered Los Angeles\u2019 creative music scene. Working closely with LA icon Vinny Golia, and with his own Balkan jazz-rock group PLOTZ, and improv band DR. MiNT, as well as many other projects, Rosenboom\u2019s route into the jazz world was circuitous, to say the least. However, over the last decade, he\u2019s solidified his place as a pillar in LA\u2019s music community, and has produced more than 25 albums, both under his own name and with various bands. He is also the founder of visionary creative music label Orenda Records, whose roster encompasses dozens of artists.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest unifying factors in my music is the eschewing of genre constraints in favor of interesting and often unusual grooves, melodies, harmonies, textures, and sounds,\u201d Rosenboom said.\n\nAs a composer, he has been recognized with grants and awards from the American Composers Forum, ASCAP, the Meet the Composer Foundation, and the Yvar Mikhashoff Trust for New Music.

On the one hand, Doucet dredges up ancient Cajun tunes with medieval French roots, and on the other, plays flamboyant fiddle with Beausoleil. Aside from Beausoleil, singer and fiddler Doucet has performed and recorded with the more purely traditional Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band. He is as passionate about Cajun tradition as he is eager to drop-kick it into the 21st century, and for that reason, Doucet has earned the applause of both purists and plebians who just want to boogie.\nFollowing a family tradition, Doucet played music from his earliest years, mastering banjo at the age of five and guitar at eight. Like others of the era, he was influenced by rock music, although Cajun music was ever-present. Doucet played in folk-rock bands with his cousin, Zachary Richard, at the age of 12, then joined a Cajun rock group. In 1974, he and Richard visited France and after his return to the U.S., he learned violin, which quickly became his principal instrument.

J.Morgan matches these songs with cinematic videos that are anything but average. Over the past few years, J.Morgan has been consistently headlining his own shows and supporting touring artists like Andre Nikatina, J.Lately, Equipto, and Berner. Hip hop music is J. Morgan\u2019s passion, and you can hear and feel that on every track.\nJ.Morgan, born Jonathan Albert Morgan, is an American rapper from the San Francisco Bay Area. Jonathan entered the hip hop scene under the alias J-Doe (John Doe) in 2010 with his debut mixtape, Money Be Da Motivation, presented by Goldtoes Entertainment. He is better known for his more recent releases as J.Morgan such as Human, Demons, Livin' Lyrics and a variety of self written/produced music videos cleverly paired with captivating songs. J-Doe's name switch came in 2015 and was motivated by his growth as an artist. The name change was symbolic in the sense that J.Morgan had found himself and was no longer J-Doe (an unidentifiable person) and essentially separating the old art from the new. J.Morgan was fascinated by music and performing arts at a very young age. He started writing lyrics in elementary school but wouldn't learn to develop them into songs until his high school years at Cappuccino High School. There he would partake in endless freestyle sessions with other kids and he started to emerge himself in the local Hip Hop scene of the San Francisco area. It wasn\u2019t until he graduated from high school that he got the chance to be in professional environments where he honed his song writing skills. Since 2010, he has released mixtapes, solo albums and collaborative works with various hip hop artists from the USA and Canada. J.Morgan has been described as a \u201cprolific rhyme slinger\u201d with a \"musical diary of sorts; his songs are honest and personal and they touch on matters close to the heart.\" His 2010 mixtape Money Be Da Motivation, featured Bay Area legend San Quinn. His 2011 mixtape More Bars In More Places included the popular song Vodka In My Coffee which resulted in his first professional music video filmed and cut by 4Reel Films (Josh Blacman). From 2012-2014 he released 6 collaborative albums with recording artist and producer Heroe Diah Pyles titled J-Doe As Captain Morgan, Make It Count, The Way I'm Feeling Now, Read Between The Lines, Faded, and More Problems Than Money. In 2013 J.Morgan and Heroe opened up shows for Ras Kass, The Jacka, San Quinn, Berner, Sellassie and Love Rance. In 2015 he made the name switch to J.Morgan and started a new era of his music. He began working with producer/song writer Bryce Graven aka Shiesty which helped develope a distinct style and sound. Together they created J.Morgan's debut solo album Human. Shorty after the Human release Morgan traveled across the United States on the Bourne Madd Tour performing alongsid J.Lately, Telli Prego, and Hugo Monster. In 2016, J.Morgan was apart of events that included many emerging emcees along with Equipto and Locksmith. J.Morgan released a two part EP titled Demons and continued producing cinematic music videos like The Trap and Echo. J.Morgan was born April 6th 1989 in Daly City, California.

Ball, the 2018 Texas State Musician Of The Year, has won worldwide fame and countless fans for her ability to ignite a full-scale roadhouse rhythm and blues party every time she takes the stage. Her rollicking Texas boogies, swampy New Orleans ballads and groove-laden Gulf Coast blues have made her a one-of-a-kind favorite with music lovers all over the world. With each new release, her reputation as a profoundly soulful singer, a boundlessly talented pianist and a courageous, inventive songwriter continues to grow. Her love of the road has led to years of soul-satisfying performances at festivals, concert halls and clubs. The New York Times says, \"Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time.\" The Houston Chronicle says simply, \"She's as perfect as an artist can be.\"\n\nWith her new album, Shine Bright, Ball set out to, in her words, \"Make the best Marcia Ball record I could make.\" In doing so, she has put together the most musically substantial, hopeful and uplifting set of songs of her five-decade career. Produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and recorded in Texas and Louisiana, Shine Bright contains twelve songs (including nine originals), ranging from the title track's rousing appeal for public and private acts of courage to the upbeat call to action of \"Pots And Pans,\" a song inspired by renowned Texas political writer and humorist Molly Ivins. From the humorous advice of \"Life Of The Party\" to the poignantly optimistic \"World Full Of Love,\" the intensity of Ball's conviction never wavers while, simultaneously, the fun never stops. Shine Bright is exactly the album Ball set out to make. \"It is a ridiculously hopeful, cheerful record,\" she says, in light of some of the album's more serious subject matter. The secret, according to Ball \"is to set the political songs to a good dance beat.\"\n\nBorn in Orange, Texas in 1949 to a family whose female members all played piano, Ball grew up in the small town of Vinton, Louisiana, right across the border from Texas. She began taking piano lessons at age five, playing old Tin Pan Alley and popular music tunes from her grandmother's collection. But it wasn't until she was 13 that Marcia discovered the power of soul music. One day in New Orleans in 1962, she sat amazed as Irma Thomas delivered the most spirited and moving performance the young teenager had ever seen. A few years later she attended Louisiana State University, where she played some of her very first gigs with a blues-based rock band called Gum.\n\nIn 1970, Ball set out for San Francisco. Her car broke down in Austin, and while waiting for repairs she fell in love with the city and decided to stay. It wasn't long before she was performing in local clubs with a progressive country band called Freda And The Firedogs, while beginning to sharpen her songwriting skills. It was around this time that she delved deeply into the music of the great New Orleans piano players, especially Professor Longhair. \"Once I found out about Professor Longhair,\" recalls Ball, \"I knew I had found my direction.\"\n\nWhen Freda And The Firedogs broke up in 1974, Ball launched her solo career, playing clubs around Austin, Houston and Louisiana. She signed with Capitol Records in 1978, debuting with the country-rock album Circuit Queen. Creating and honing her own sound, she released six critically acclaimed titles on the Rounder label during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Ball\u2014collaborating with Angela Strehli and Lou Ann Barton\u2014recorded the hugely successful Dreams Come True on the Antone's label. At the end of 1997, Marcia finished work on a similar \"three divas of the blues\" project for Rounder, this time in the distinguished company of Tracy Nelson and her longtime inspiration, Irma Thomas. The CD, Sing It!, was released in 1998 and was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nMarcia Ball has appeared many times on national television over the years, including the PBS special In Performance At The White House along with B.B. King and Della Reese, Austin City Limits and HBO's Treme. She performed in Piano Blues, the film directed by Clint Eastwood included in Martin Scorsese's The Blues series which aired on PBS television nationwide in 2003. Marcia also appeared on The Late Show With David Letterman with The New Orleans Social Club, where she not only reached millions of people, but also helped to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. In 2012, she had a role in the independent film Angels Sing starring Harry Connick, Jr., Lyle Lovett and Willie Nelson. In 2017 she performed on NPR's A Jazz Piano Christmas, live from The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nBall joined Alligator in 2001 with the release of the critically acclaimed Presumed Innocent. The CD won the 2002 Blues Music Award for Blues Album Of The Year. Her follow-up, So Many Rivers, was nominated for a Grammy Award, and won the 2004 Blues Music Award for Contemporary Blues Album Of The Year as well as the coveted Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year award. Her next release, Live! Down The Road, released in 2005, also garnered a Grammy nomination, as did 2008's Peace, Love & BBQ (the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart). 2010's Grammy-nominated Roadside Attractions and 2014's The Tattooed Lady And The Alligator Man successfully grew her fan base even further. Altogether she holds ten Blues Music Awards, ten Living Blues Awards, and five Grammy Award nominations. She has been inducted into both the Gulf Coast Music Hall Of Fame and the Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. The Texas State legislature named her the official 2018 Texas State Musician. As her hometown Austin Chronicle says, \"What's not to like about Marcia Ball?\"\n\nSince joining Alligator, Ball has blossomed as a songwriter. Each album has been filled with fresh, original songs, never more so than on Shine Bright. Ball easily draws her listeners deep into her music with instantly memorable melodies and imaginative imagery. Her songs paint vibrant musical pictures richly detailed with recognizable characters, regional flavors, universal themes and colorful scenes, both real and imagined. Living Blues declares, \"Her originals sound like timeless classics and southern soul masterpieces that no one else can imitate.\"\n\nNow, with Shine Bright, Ball's new, aggressively hopeful songs are energized by Steve Berlin's inventive and exciting production, creating electrifying music that is daring, inspired, poignant and timely. The Boston Globe calls Ball \"a compelling storyteller\" who plays \"an irresistible, celebratory blend of rollicking, two-fisted New Orleans piano, Louisiana swamp rock and smoldering Texas blues.\"\n\nOf course, Ball will bring the party on the road, playing her new songs and old favorites for fans around the globe. \"I still love the feel of the wheels rolling,\" she says, \"and the energy in a room full of people ready to go wherever it is we take them.\" With both her new album and her legendary live performances, Marcia Ball will shine a light into the darkness, making the world a brighter place one song at a time.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Dylan LeBlanc", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8497642.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "Dylan LeBlanc\u2019s new Album \"Renegade\" out now via ATO Records!\nhttp://smarturl.it/dylanleblancrenegade", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "374 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Aaron Goldberg", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7448569.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.885984, 37.330601], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Piano Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Stritch", "moreBioInfo": "Aaron Goldberg is an American jazz pianist.

It could have been their only album; or it could have never been made at all. It\u2019s either a refined culmination of 15 years of collaborative music-making or the blunt instrument on which they cut their teeth. This chicken v. egg debate will be for historians to decide; fact is that if \u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp\u201d was a half-baked idea back in 2001, it has been reborn in 2016, fully baked.\n\nIn the waning days of our previous millennium, an envelope arrived at the Dr. Dog Bungalow. Initially misplaced among credit card solicitations and clothing catalogs, it had no postage and smelled of a fusty funk, as if it had once been wet. The return address said simply \u201cPhrases from the Psychedelic Swap.\u201d\nInside was a cassette tape. \u201cPlay me,\u201d it said. So they did, and they grew 10 feet tall \u2014 tall enough to reach the key but too big to fit through the door.\nPhrases, they learned, was a man who had been neither happy nor sad, neither success nor failure, during his time on Earth. He just kind of was. Or wasn\u2019t. Was or wasn\u2019t, depending. In his quest for satisfaction, he found himself susceptible to hollow promises. He drank Coke, but it did not make him smile. He used Old Spice, but beautiful women did not whistle at him. He wore Air Jordans, but jumped no higher. And one day he awoke from a beautiful dream to find himself still lying next to the wife he neither loved nor hated. Lying still, still lying. Same gray room, same gray life. He knew he had to slip away. It took only a slight turn of the wheel.\nLife in the Psychedelic Swamp, a refracted reflection of reality, gave Phrases all that he was looking for. Music took on new dimensions. Food tasted better. Love was sweeter. At least initially. The swamp was draped heavily with abstraction, where there was nothing too garbled, random or chaotic to be separated from the absolute need for meaning.\n\nBut soon the same old hollowness crept back into his soul. The romance of harvesting dry rot and herding acorn weevils under the swamp\u2019s moon-sun had dulled into a humdrum kind of workaday existence. He began to regret his decision to leave Earth for the Psychedelic Swamp. Things were not really better there, only different. Remember what the old swamp folks say: The bladderwort is always yellower on the other side of the schist. This was his epiphany. Life, flawed as it is, is meant to embraced.\n\nIt was this message, more or less, that came through on that funky old cassette tape in the mail. And \u201cPlay Me,\u201d didn\u2019t mean simply \u201cListen to Me,\u201d but literally \u201cPlay Me!\u201d It was a call to action, urging Dr. Dog to record a great pop album, to give meaning to Phrases, backed by oohs and ahhs and layered harmonies, to top the charts, capture the imagination and bring joy to the people.\nWhy us, the band wondered. They were so young, mostly just a cover band, sort of lost in their own verdant vegetative environment, fiddling around in the basement with a loose assemblage of chords and riffs, on equipment held together with duct tape and rust. They were not ready. To do justice to \u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp,\u201d they first had to find themselves as a band. They were flawed, reluctant messengers, like Spider-Man or Siddhartha, bestowed with a responsibility they did not yet accept. They needed to face the trials and tribulations of life on the road, to hone their skills as songwriters and performers.\nYears went by, and the band became bogged down in life of a recording-touring rock\u2019n\u2019roll operation. The tape was often lost, only to be found in dusty corners or falling out of a seldom used guitar case. Someday, the band vowed, we will get back to \u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp.\u201d\nThat day is now. Swamp is on. Phrases will be heard.\n\n\u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp\u201d is Dr. Dog\u2019s ninth album, and third studio release with the ANTI- label. Most of the songs were among the first ever written together by Scott McMicken and Toby Leaman along with the friends and cohorts that would evolve into Dr. Dog. This early endeavor helped shape their worldview of a label-defying, multi-hyphenated indie-psychedelic-rock-folk-basement-Americana-touring band. Many artists might cringe at the idea of revisiting the works of their younger selves. Not Dr. Dog. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked back at that time with anything other than real affection,\u201d McMicken said. \u201cThe original tape could have disappeared and never been heard again, and I still would have held it dear to my heart, because it was the closest I\u2019ve ever been to a true creative process.\u201d\nIf the seeds that were planted in \u201cThe Psychedelic Swamp\u201d helped give voice to many of Dr. Dog\u2019s songs over the years, this revisiting finds the fruit of 15 years of collaboration in full bloom. Fans will recognize the harmonies, the puckish wordplay and the introspection, but it\u2019s impossible to place these songs in the Dr. Dog chronology. The album opens with \u201cThe Golden Hind\u201d echoing the dreamy low-fi pops and whistles found on the album \u201cEasy Beat\u201d (2005), while the next song, \u201cDead Record Player,\u201d could just as easily been found among the smooth front-stoop soul of \u201cB-Room\u201d (2013). It\u2019s as if past, present and future Dr. Dog are collaborating in a kind of timeless recording studio. Even the songs within \u201cPsychedelic Swamp\u201d borrow from each other: Leaman\u2019s \u201cBring My Baby Back\u201d is a whole song sprung from a single line in \u201cEngineer Says.\u201d\nLeaman says this is not a rock opera with a traditional A-to-Z narrative arc, but rather a tapestry of Phrases\u2019 search for happiness. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable calling it a concept album, for sure,\u201d he says.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "330 Virginia Street, Vallejo, CA 94590", "Artist": "Jack Pollard", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8832271.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.257147, 38.102407], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz Blues and R&B", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Empress Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "As an entertainer and a showman, Jack brings a lifetime of experience to the stage.

Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Kandace Springs", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8744295.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, R&b/soul, Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "If Kandace Springs' new album Indigo sounds like something new, that's because it is. Simple while funky. Classic but contemporary. Straightforward in the way it breaks down complex ideas and genres. And, at the end of the day, undeniably human. That said, it isn't quite a rebirth for the Nashville-born artist, who after stints living in New York and Los Angeles has returned back home to Music City. She's long had that lithe and smoky voice and an intensely expressive mastery over the piano. For those paying attention, Kandace's second album finds her unleashing what was there all along, all at once, for the first time.\n\nFor Kandace it boils down to a question that connects past to present: \u201cWhat would Nina Simone do if she had the technology of today? You could never put Nina in a box\u2014she would do a blues followed a classical piece, a jazz standard and then a Beatles cover. This LP took a lot of inspiration from that\u2014it\u2019s a mix of everything that I am.\u201d Indigo offers a fairly plausible answer to that impossible query: songs that swirl classical composition with quiet-storm cool, jazz poise with hip-hop swing, tropical warmth with soulful depth, and earthen groove with airy psych. With all but two of the tracks here produced by the mighty drummer-producer Karriem Riggins\u2014the living bridge spanning Oscar Peterson and Diana Krall to Erykah Badu and J Dilla\u2014Indigo creates a vibe as familiar as it is previously unheard.\n\nTake \u201cIndigo Part 1,\u201d and \u201cIndigo Part 2,\u201d a pair of interludes that give the album its title, where allusions\u2014Rachmaninoff, Portishead, Sade\u2014emerge and melt into the liquid soundscape. It feels like magic. And then there's \u201cDon\u2019t Need The Real Thing\u201d with a breezy dancehall beat that'd sound at home in today's Top 40, except far more musical and almost hypnotic in its combination of plaintive bass and busy percussion. Kandace\u2019s versatility is underscored when one juxtaposes \u201cBreakdown,\u201d a pop ballad stunner that Kandace co-wrote with the track\u2019s producer Jamie Hartman (Rag'n'Bone Man), and \u201cUnsophisticated,\u201d a sultry jazz ballad that features Roy Hargrove's trumpet playfully intertwined with Kandace's voice and keys.\n\nAsk our heroine how Indigo became the name of the entire project and she replies, with an air of mystery, \u201cThe album is an exotic flower, its own kind.\u201d The more you listen, the more that makes sense. In fact, she could be describing herself.\n\nKandace grew up the bi-racial daughter of a soul singer in a country-western town. Her dad Scat Springs had his own band but also sang backup for an incredible array of musicians: Brian McKnight, Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Michael McDonald, Donna Summer. He did voices on Nashville radio too, while Kandace's mother had a full-time gig raising three talented daughters at home. Kandace's first passions were drawing and cars. \u201cMy dad gave me a Matchbox muscle car and my mom gave me a Barbie,\u201d she says. \u201cI drew a mustache on Barbie and never played with her again. I still have the Matchbox.\u201d\n\nShe collects, rebuilds, and resells cars to this day, but her plans to one day study automotive design were put on hold at age 10 when Scat brought home an upright piano (side note: Kandace still plans to pursue her dream of going to automotive school one day). She couldn't leave the keys alone, and soon mom started taking her to lessons, while dad let her tag along to sessions and led his own three-girl choir in the living room. \u201cHe'd make us do hymns but we hated it,\" Kandace laughs. \"We'd be singing and crying at the same time.\u201d\n\nHer father instilled in Kandace a love of the greats\u2014Nina of course, but also Ella Fitzgerald, Eva Cassidy, Luther Vandross\u2014and eventually they grew closer than ever through music. He helped her record a demo at 15 and got it into the hands of the production team Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken, who have written hits for the likes of Shakira, Christina Aguilera, and Kelly Clarkson, and are best known for discovering Rihanna as a teen and signing her to their production company SRP. They offered Kandace a deal but it was too much, too soon. \u201cMy dad said, \u2018If you sign with these guys, I'll never get the chance to make an album with you,\u2019\u201d says Kandace. \u201cI'm so glad I waited.\u201d She and Scat made that album when she was 17 and though it was never released, a piece of it appears on Indigo. Scat suffered a stroke in early 2017 that rendered him unable to sing, so she pulled one of his original vocals from their record and set it to new music. Powered by her signature Rhodes electric piano, \u201cSimple Things\u201d is the beating heart of this LP.\n\nWhen the time came, Evan and Carl got Kandace into Blue Note Records to audition for president Don Was. She performed a Bonnie Raitt song that he'd originally produced, and he was sold. Her 2014 self-titled EP found her teaming with cutting-edge hitmakers like Pop & Oak and won her late-night TV appearances on Letterman, Kimmel and Fallon, plus sets at festivals like Bonnaroo and Afropunk. Her 2016 full-length Soul Eyes took a different tack. Grown, stripped, and refined, it was essentially a live album\u2014solid, unfussy bedrock for future experimentation. All that history, and the fact that she featured on a couple Ghostface Killah cuts, made Karriem exactly the right person to work with Kandace to catalyze the best parts of various interests into something new.\n\n\u201cI love crossing genres and the direction on Indigo was to marry all the different things to tell her story,\u201d says Karriem, who tracked his drums at various studios while on the road with Krall, and chopped and reassembled his and Kandace's recordings into what you hear. \u201cIt sounds organic because everything was built around the songwriting. She says so much on the piano, and her voice is amazing\u2014it's the focal point of the whole sound. I kept it simple, added a little punch.\u201d\n\nKandace also co-wrote several songs with her longtime collaborators Evan and Carl including \u201cPiece of Me\u201d which finds Kandace channeling Sade to stunning effect. The three also wrote \u201cFix Me\u201d together, taking inspiration from Chopin\u2019s Prelude No. 4, and the groovy lament \u201cLove Sucks\u201d which was produced by Evan and Carl along with the UK\u2019s Jimmy Hogarth (Amy Winehouse, Corinne Bailey Rae).\n\nSome of Indigo's greatest songs are its most unadorned: \u201cBlack Orchid\u201d highlights the acoustic strum of guitarist-songwriter Jesse Harris (who struck Grammy gold with Kandace's early hero Norah Jones by penning her breakout hit \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why\u201d); a cover of The Stylistics' \u201cPeople Make the World Go Round\u201d drifts languidly over Karriem\u2019s drum programming; the remake of Gabriel Garz\u00f3n-Montano's \u201cSix Eight\u201d is molasses slow and crystalline pretty; and the Roberta Flack-popularized torch song \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\u201d (a crowd favorite at Kandace\u2019s live shows) radiates light from the white space between notes. That one was special for Kandace. \u201cPrince picked it for me to play for Purple Rain's 30th anniversary at Paisley Park in 2014,\u201d she says. \u201cHis band played behind me. He stood off to the right. It's something I'll never forget.\u201d That was Kandace's first big break. The legendary artist saw her on YouTube before she'd released a single note and invited her out. It's testament, again, to the power and potential that's been in Kandace this whole time.\n\nIf you listen closely, you'll hear a nod to Prince in the lyrics of \u201cFix Me,\u201d but the best tribute she could pay to him, Ms. Simone, and the humble legacy of the man who introduced her to music, her father, is by, as Karriem words it, \u201ccreating something that adds to the art form.\u201d With Indigo, an album that couldn't have been made by anyone but her, Kandace Springs does exactly that.\n\nFor more information contact Cem Kurosman at Blue Note Records\n(p) 212.786.8634 (e) cem.kurosman@umusic.com", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland presents Kandace Springs"}, {"Address": "850 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Darryl Kniffen", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9142313.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.403379, 37.797161], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Jazz Fusion, Jazz Instrument", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Cigar Bar & Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Drummer/composer/educator Darryl Kniffen leads the Billboard-charting jazz fusion group Planet Kniffen.

While she has been known as the \u201cLittle Folksinger,\u201d her music has embraced punk, funk, hip hop, jazz, soul, electronica and even more distant sounds. Her collaborators have included everyone from Utah Phillips to legendary R&B saxophonist Maceo Parker to Prince. She has shared stages with Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Pete Seeger, Kris Kristofferson, Greg Brown, Billy Bragg, Michael Franti, Chuck D., and many more. Her most recent album Binary was released in June 2017 on Righteous Babe Records and her memoir No Walls and the Recurring Dream \ufeffwas released in May 2019 by Viking Books.\n\nRejecting the major label system has given her significant creative freedom. She has referenced her staunchly-held independence in song more than once, including in \"The Million You Never Made\" (Not a Pretty Girl), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, \"The Next Big Thing\" (Not So Soft), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and \"Napoleon\" (Dilate), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label. After recording with Ani in 1999, Prince described the effects of her independence. \"We jammed for four hours and she danced the whole time. We had to quit because she wore us out. After being with her, it dawned on me why she's like that \u2013 she's never had a ceiling over her.\"\n\nHer lyrics are rhythmic and poetic, often autobiographical, and strongly political. \u201cTrickle Down\u201d discusses racism and gentrification, while \u201cTo The Teeth\u201d speaks about the need for gun control, and \u201cIn or Out\u201d questions society\u2019s traditional sexuality labels. Most recently, the 2016 single \"Play God\" has become a battle cry for reproductive rights. Rolling Stone said of her in 2012, \"The world needs more radicals like Ani DiFranco: wry, sexy, as committed to beauty and joy as revolution.\"\n\nOver the years she's performed at countless benefit concerts, donated songs to many charity albums, and given time and energy to many progressive causes. She has learned from and demonstrated beside Gloria Steinem, Jesse Jackson and Dennis Kucinich. In 2004, she marched in the front row of the March for Women's Lives along with Margaret Cho, Janeane Garofalo, Whoopi Goldberg, and many others, later performing on the main stage. She has beaten the drum for voter registration and turnout with \"Vote Dammit\" tours in multiple presidential election years, including most recently in 2016. She's currently on the board of Roots of Music, an organization that provides at-risk youth with support and musical education in New Orleans, and the creative council of EMILY\u2019s List, which helps elect pro-choice Democratic women to office.\n\nAs an iconic songwriter and social activist, she has been the inspiration for woman artists and entrepreneurs for over two decades. She has been featured on the covers of SPIN, Ms., Relix, High Times, and many others for her music and activism. She is the idol of empowered women who came of age in the 90s and continues to bring younger fans into her fold. From Alice Walker to Amy Schumer, Ani is respected by wordsmiths across milieux and generations. She blazed the trail for self-directed artist careers and has been cited by musicians from Prince to Bon Iver as an inspiration to release their own art outside of the major label system.\n\nAni has been the recipient of many honors and awards, including a Grammy for best album package (Evolve), the Woman of Courage Award from the National Organization for Women, the Gay/Lesbian American Music Award for Female Artist of the Year, and the Woody Guthrie Award. At the 2013 Winnipeg Folk Festival she received their prestigious Artistic Achievement Award, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Winnipeg. In 2017, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from A2IM (a nonprofit trade organization that represents independent record labels) and the Outstanding Achievement for Global Activism Award from A Global Friendship.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Party Nails", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8825836.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: alt pop", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Bottom Of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.partypartynails.com\n\nParty Nails\u2019 music lies between pop, alternative and electronic (and with nod to punk).

As friends in high school, guitarist Andrew MacKenzie, singer/melodica player Ryan Thaxter , bassist Sean Craffey, guitarist Cory Mahoney, and drummer Kyle Hancock shared a love of pop-punk and ska, bonding over bands like Black Flag, until they caught wind of Augustus Pablo\u2019s 1974 dub classic Ital Dub. This was the gamechanger that set the stage for their current musical approach: using introspective, spacious bass and drum grooves to anchor a thickly-textured interplay of instruments, vocals, and timbres. With their third album, Light Flashes, Dubbest is poised for national recognition.\n\n\n\nPolished to perfection over a three-year period, Light Flashes invokes the spark of inspiration the band felt working with veteran producer Craig \u201cDubfader\u201d Welsch of 10 Ft. Ganja Plant over at Rear Window Studios in Brookline, MA. As Andrew MacKenzie notes, \u201cIt is a powerful name to us, and it tends to catch one\u2019s attention, like an actual flashing light. It\u2019s a great fit for this album. The name and the artwork together help bring out the album\u2019s edge.\u201d They credit Welsch with taking their music to a higher level of musicianship and authenticity, noting how he draws out the best from each band member and employs a large stock of vintage instruments, such as a Hammond B3 organ and 1950s Fender Stratocasters, to convincingly evoke the 1970s glory days of roots reggae and dub. Kevin Metcalfe\u2019s mastering work cemented this old-school sound: he has provided the finishing touch on albums by U.K.\u2019s pop, rock, and reggae luminaries since the 1960s. On the musician front, the band was aided by stalwarts of the Boston scene, including Elliot Martin of John Brown\u2019s Body on backing vocals and 10 Ft. Ganja Plant\u2019s Mark Berney, Jared Sims, and Brian Thomas on horns and Steve D on synthesizer.\n\n\n\nThe album maintains a fresh and fascinating feel with its contrasting blend of catchy uptempo crowdpleasers and dub instrumentals that manage to stay sunny. Thanks to the professionalism of its recording and arrangements, it stands out as a worthy successor to the greats of yesteryear who guide the band\u2019s aesthetic: Toots and The Maytals, Augustus Pablo, and Gregory Isaacs, to name a few. Crowd favorite \u201cOne Thing\u201d closes their shows, but starts the album on the right foot, establishing its dub vibration. The next two tracks, \u201cSpend The Day\u201d and \u201cWeeping Heart,\u201d create a radio-friendly one-two punch through energetic grooves, soulful melodies, and lyrics meant for singing into a lady love\u2019s ear. Another love song, \u201cEnd Of The Road,\u201d is probably the album\u2019s oldest track and one of many to feature a three-part horn section imported from ska, here as an expression of heightened emotion. On the track, \u201cGive In,\u201d the horns join the bass line to deliver raw power meant to be cranked at high volume. Keyboards take center stage on the space jam \u201cLeaving,\u201d the instrumental \u201cEscape Route,\u201d and the live-show staple \u201cCross Pollination.\u201d Light Flashes closes with \u201cLeave In Dub,\u201d a track that proves why Welsch\u2019s nickname is \u201cDubfader\u201d; it also provides the perfect coda to the final song, \u201cBy Design,\u201d driven by Elliott Martin\u2019s stellar harmony vocals.\n\n\n\nDubbest has just launched an album release tour that will introduce them to the West Coast territory that put North American reggae on the map, home to heavy-hitters like Groundation, Slightly Stoopid, and Rebelution. Live shows give the band a chance to stretch their legs and revel in spontaneity. They like to expand the dub sections of songs to showcase each performer and surprise the crowd with obscure roots reggae tracks. As MacKenzie puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s always an exciting show because you never know what we\u2019ll play.\u201d The combination of this in-the-moment energy with Light Flashes\u2019s studio wizardry and songwriting prowess causes a combustion that propels the band\u2019s musical journey toward timelessness.", "otherInfo": "All Ages\nDoors 7:30pm\nShow 8:30pm"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Junior Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Mal Blum", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9469843.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Singer/songwriter, Folk", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club Crystal Cavern", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Mal Blum return to the Bay to celebrate their album 'Pity Boy', supported by Diners."}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "DJ Toure", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7263539.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "Rare is the Disc Jockey who combines intellect, business savvy, professionalism, and a suave sense of fashion with an innate love of most every musical genre but DJ Toure is that man.
