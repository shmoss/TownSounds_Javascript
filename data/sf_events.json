His latest studio album, Gotta Get Back, produced by Jano Rix of The Wood Brothers, and its companion release, Live At Mauch Chunk Opera House, further expand upon this reputation.\n\nGrowing up on a commune in rural North Carolina, the son of classically trained musicians, Seth Walker played cello long before discovering the six-string in his 20s. When his introduction to the blues came via his Uncle Landon Walker, who was both a musician and disc jockey, his fate was forever sealed. Instantaneously, Seth was looking to artists like T-Bone Walker, Snooks Eaglin, and B.B. King as a wellspring of endless inspiration. The rest is history. He's released seven albums between 1997 and 2015; breaking into the Top 20 of the Americana charts and receiving praise from NPR, American Songwriter, No Depression and Blues Revue, among others.\n\nIn addition to extensive recording and songwriting pursuits, Seth is consistently touring and performing at venues and festivals around the world. Along with headline shows, he's been invited to open for The Mavericks, The Wood Brothers, Raul Malo, Paul Thorn and Ruthie Foster, among others.\n\nSeth Walker is currently splitting his time between New Orleans and New York City after previously residing in Austin and Nashville. He\u2019s used those experiences wisely, soaking up the sounds and absorbing the musical lineage of these varied places. With a bluesman\u2019s respect for roots and tradition, coupled with an appreciation for\u2014and successful melding of\u2014contemporary songwriting, Seth sublimely incorporates a range of styles with warmth and grace. Perhaps Country Standard Time said it best: \u201cIf you subscribe to the Big Tent theory of Americana, then Seth Walker \u2013with his blend of blues, gospel, pop, R&B, rock, and a dash country\u2014just might be your poster boy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Paynkiller ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9077724.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Metal, Instrumental, Other", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Randy Paynter. 18 year old speed metal solo artist from New Jersey.

His first album \"So Long\" caught the attention of a major label. He signed with Lava/Atlantic and released his first record having only played a few live shows prior. This relationship lead Louque into 2 years of touring and selling his music to film.\n\nIt is often realized that less is more. Louque felt his own less-is-more calling and he separated himself from the fast changing music/major label industry.\n\nToday he travels and performs year round connecting on a more personal level with fans of his music. He performs solo at times, but often plays and travels with classical pianist Margaret Hebert, a native of Lafayette, Louisiana.

The two recently relocated from New Orleans to Lafayette.\n\nThe duo is currently booking East and West Coast tours for later this year. In the spirit of cultivating a more intimate connection through music, they seek unconventional venues such as barns, backyards, living rooms, old churches and beyond. A shared vision and collaboration with fans of LOUQUE\u2019s music is a key part of the experience.\n\nDustan continues to collaborate with many other musicians from around the country such as Nels Cline, who shared the stage with both he and Hebert at Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, TN and at New Orleans Airlift in 2017.

It would only be eight years later that Guns N' Roses would release their masterpiece, Appetite for Destruction, and in turn, open Brock's eyes to the possibility of a career in guitar soloing.\n\nBrock's first band, The Corporate Sugar Daddies, rose to cult status in the King George area of Virginia while he was in high school. The band released two albums, the breakout debut, Flow, and the follow up release, The Corporate Sugar Daddies. CSD broke up after being passed over for an appearance on NBC's Saved By The Bell - a crushing blow to the group that was already dealing with the pressures of being a hip, local high school act. The rejection from Saved by the Bell knocked the band down and they never really got up. The only thing left do was move on.\n\nAfter graduating from High School a year early, and finding that substitute teaching was not his bag, he decided to move South and go to college. Brock kissed King George goodbye and made his way to Savannah, GA for what would eventually become a turning point in his life. Brock enrolled in The Savannah College of Art and Design where he pursued and obtained a degree in video and film production as well as a minor in sound engineering.

They've played their shows, developed their sound, released their records and very quietly built a massive fan base in the process.\n\nWhat makes this band different from all the others is that their local fan base includes Bruce Springsteen, David Bryan, and Steve Cropper, all of whom have volunteered to perform on the band's album, Brotherhood.\n\nPrior to Brotherhood's release, Matt's talent was recognized globally when he got the nod to join rock legends Bon Jovi as their guitarist/backing vocalist on their 2015 stadium tour of the Far East.\n\nWhen some of your biggest supporters have sold over 200 million units, you know you're doing something right.\n\nIn addition to being a creative songwriter, Matt was recognized by the industry as a guitar great after winning a national guitar contest hosted by B.B. King and John Mayer through Guitar Center and Guitar World magazine. Matt beat out over 4,000 competitors to win the grand prize which consisted of multiple guitars, an endorsement from Gibson, a shopping spree at Guitar Center and a new car from Scion. This major accomplishment was the spark that jumpstarted his career and gave his band momentum for their future success.\n\nGrowing up on influencers ranging from Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Rory Gallagher, ZZ Top, Robin Trower, Joe Walsh, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Matt O'Ree Band has taken all these diverse elements and forged a new iron.\n\nMatt's writing is inspired by many life experiences and years of study from the ones that have written the book on how to play real guitar rock music. Not as a photocopy, but in a new light that hasn't been seen in quite some time. Now is the time for real music and real musicianship to make a resurrection.\n\nRecently, the band has been promoting two new singles \"Without You\" and \"Through Time With You\" co-written and produced by John Ginty, B3 Organ player for the Allman Betts Band and the Dixie Chicks. The songs are an indication that the band is moving in a new direction forming a powerhouse team, blending Eryn's soulful vocals with Matt's gritty vocals and unparalleled guitar. Together these two front an incredible sound where the audience can feel the sparks between them. The chemistry on stage is unstoppable.\n\nEryn is an accomplished artist in her right. She won awards such as the BELK Southern Musician Showcase/Blues Artist as well as Asbury Park's Top Female Vocalist and Top Blues Band. She is also the youngest artist to be inducted into the NJ/NY Blues Hall of Fame and one of only three females who have been inducted. She has performed or opened for artists such as Don McLean, Gregg Allman, Johnny Winter, Robert Cray, Dr. John, Shemekia Copeland, The Gin Blossoms, Little River Band, Marcia Ball, Walter Wolfman Washington, Eric Lindell, Sonny Landreth, The Radiators, Johnny A and so many more. She also recently sang backup vocals with the Smashing Pumpkins on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nTogether, the band takes their fans on a ride that hasn't been heard or seen at this level since the '70s. Their live show is like revisiting a Zeppelin concert at the Garden, and with Lex Lehman's smooth soulful bass, John Hummel's Bonham-esque drums, and Eryn's angelic and gutsy lead and backing vocals, Matt and company have built a foundation that can hold up the biggest house on the block.", "otherInfo": "Matt O\u2019Ree Band Live from Sofa Stage!\n--------------------------------\n\nMOB family- it\u2019s spring cleaning time!\nJoin Matt & Eryn 7pm EST for an acoustic Qtine house party and live Q+A from the comfort of your sofa.\n\nStreaming available on Facebook, YouTube, Mixer, and Twitch.\n\nVIRTUAL TIP JARS\n-------------------\nVenmo: @matthew-oree\nPayPal / Zelle: mattoree@mattoree.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Paul Potts LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616822.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Recording a live operatic song each day"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Workman Song LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6752498.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Alternative Folk, Alternative Country-rock, Psychedelic Pop, Singer-songwriter, Spiritual, Alternative Ccm, Jam Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Folk, Grunge, Alternative, Christian Alternative, Gospel, Art Rock", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Workman Song has all the hallmarks of the well-kept secret: an intimately folksy but oddly psychedelic labor of love from a prolific artist whose prodigious musical gifts exceed his powers of self-disclosure or self-promotion, and whose inexplicably diverse body of work shows a visionary of so many faces no one can agree who he is. When given a stage from which to sing, he simply soars. The soul-stirring wail of Brooklyn-by-way-of-Western Massachusetts singer-songwriter Sean McMahon belies the otherworldliness of his inspiration, while beautiful sonic landscapes change shape and color around it, ruthlessly bending genre, hopelessly without explanation. The Deli praises his work, \"a sound that transcends anything currently in the New York scene.\"\n\nIf Dylan could sing like Buckley, if Bowie could play guitar like Harrison, you'd have an idea of just how elusive the kind of musical and songwriting gifts are which McMahon commands over and above his peers.

The Workman moniker itself nods to Christian anarchist Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker.\n\nSo much for McMahon the songwriter, McMahon the mystic. McMahon the performer, on the other hand, is a powerful and unpredictable chameleon, at turns described as a \"half-ghost\" \"wraithlike presence,\"* a \"shaman-esque leading man\" with \"casual...neo-psychedelic hippy swagger,\"** and even \"that classic glam rock sex driven Robert Plant like force...with the voice of an angel and a screaming fisher cat combined.\"***\n\nMcMahon, as Workman Song, has released 5 EP's, 1 full-length mixtape, and has several singles on power rotation on Northeast radio.

The deep pockets and far reaching influence of a major record label were gone. And for the first time in many years, the duo found themselves looking at the real possibility of having to get \u201cday jobs.\u201d\n\nInstead, Clyne and Naffah regrouped - both metaphorically and literally - and started down their own path of independence. In 2019, that trek finds Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers celebrating 20 years of chart topping albums and sold out shows across the nation and around the globe. That\u2019s in addition to the band\u2019s annual four-day music festival in Mexico also celebrating its 20th year, and Roger\u2019s own award-winning, ultra-premium top-shelf tequila called Mexican Moonshine. All with 20 years of independence.\n\nIn 1999, singer/songwriter Clyne and drummer Naffah began assembling what wold become RCPM\u2019s debut album, Honky Tonk Union. In the beginning, it was just a couple of musicians with a story to tell. But the duo didn\u2019t want to wait around for another label to judge their music or tell them to \u201cdumb it down\u201d or dismiss them because \u201cwe just aren\u2019t sure what genre you fit in.\u201d Roger and PH simply wanted to keep delivering the music straight to the fans. Out on their own, the road was daunting and passed through what seemed like every small, dark club across the country. But the music of Honky Tonk Union found the people who understood that great songs weren\u2019t only what was being played on the radio.\n\nWith every tour stop the crowds grew a bit bigger, the buzz a little louder. More importantly, the relentless support of the fans enabled Honky Tonk Union to debut at #1 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart \u2013 something even The Refreshments never obtained. The success had Billboard executives calling Clyne in bewilderment asking, \u201cWho ARE you guys?!\u201d Honky Tonk Union hollered at \u201cthe industry\u201d that a band could make music on its own terms \u2013 and still matter.\n\nFrom the opening riffs of \u201cBeautiful Disaster\u201d with its nod to Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d to the band\u2019s signature song, \u201cGreen & Dumb,\u201d Honky Tonk Union is bound in the tradition of story songs that one can immediately identify with. Rather than a big city recording studio, Clyne & Naffah found inspiration in the high-plains grasslands at the Clyne ranch owned by his grandmother, in Southeastern Arizona.\n\n\u201cGreen & Dumb\u201d was written on the day that one of the Clyne\u2019s top cattle-cuttin\u2019 horses broke his leg and had to be put down. As the tequila was passed around probably too many times, a surly Roger was rebuked from the dinner table to wander around the barnyard looking into the little adobe house through the window, ultimately spurring the story. He nostalgically remembers it as \u201dWrite drunk, edit sober. I followed half this advice while composing this song, aching and pining. Why am I always looking in? Why is there always a window in the way? Why is it when the moment passes, I know the right thing to say?\u201d\n\nAfter Honky Tonk Union, the band\u2019s success only grew.\n\nTheir second album, Sonoran Hope and Madness, debuted at #3 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Charts. Their third album, \u00a1Americano!, found RCPM again reaching #1 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart. In fact, since the release of Honky Tonk Union, Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers are the only act to release eight consecutive studio albums landing on the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart. And all on a 100% independent label, EmmaJava Records.\n\nDubbed the \u201cSpringsteen of the Southwest\u201d by the Asbury Park Press, Clyne and his guitar have toured around the world, his career now nearly reaching a quarter-century, starting with The Refreshments. The seminal Tempe, Arizona band made big waves in the \u201990s with the songs \u201cBanditos\u201d (and its infamous chorus, \u201cEverybody knows that the world is full of stupid people\u201d) and \u201cDown Together\u201d as well as writing the theme for TV\u2019s \u201cKing of the Hill.\u201d\n\nToday, Clyne and Naffah, along with bassist Nick Scropos and lead guitarist Jim Dalton, keep the songs of The Refreshments alive, while adding to their own ever growing musical legacy. The band\u2019s annual music festival in Rocky Point, Mexico, called Circus Mexicus, is a testament to their loyal fan base. What began as a rooftop show thrown together with extension cords and wooden pallets 20 years ago has blossomed into a pilgrimage that draws thousands of fans to the once sleepy fishing village. On June 6-9th 2019, Circus Mexicus celebrates 20 years with fellow Americana bands, American Aquarium, Miles Nielsen & The Rusted Hearts as well as self-described psychedelic garage folk artist Drew Hagar (son of Sammy) and a dozen more filling multiple stages in the little beach town of Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, MX.\n\nClyne not only sings about life in the border-lands, he also produces his own private label top shelf tequila called Mexican Moonshine. From gold medals in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition to gold ribbons from Tequila Aficionado\u2019s Brands of Promise, accolades have been rolling in. A bottle of Mexican Moonshine Tequila even made a well received \u201cguest appearance\u201d on the Rachel Ray Show.\n\nAnd it all started with the road to independence 20 years ago.\n\nTo celebrate this milestone, a double record of Honky Tonk Union and its live counterpart, Real to Reel, will be pressed in green and orange vinyl. A digital download companion with previously unreleased material from the Real to Reel live recordings will be included along with some stories and never before seen photos from the early days of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers.\n\nIn the spirit of the band\u2019s support of environmental conservation, this double-album will be packaged in a gatefold jacket using 100% recycled paperboard, and will be released the week of Earth Day.\n\nRoger Clyne & The Peacemakers are still blistering through every corner of the U.S. with hundreds of tour dates annually and incendiary performances that last hours.

Forever a student of great music - Staats sincerely enjoys jamming, collaborating and learning from his contemporaries and other recording artists that inspire him. A great example is a powerful late night, live off the floor version of Bob Dylan's \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice\u201d in collaboration with peer Terra Lightfoot.

CALL ME LUCKY is Chris\u2019 18th and newest record and arguably, his best.\n\nChris Smither.\n\nSongwriter. Guitarist. Bluesman. Interpreter. Performer. For over 50 years.\n\nChris Smither is truly an American original.\n\nRecorded at the gorgeous Blue Rock Studio in Texas\u2019 hill country just outside Austin, CALL ME LUCKY is Chris' latest studio record of brand - new originals in six years (release date: March 2, 2018 on Signature Sounds/Mighty Albert, distributed by Redeye). It features Chris\u2019 long-time producer and multi-instrumentalist David Goodrich, drummer Billy Conway (Morphine), Matt Lorenz (aka The Suitcase Junket), and engineer Keith Gary. The four musicians went in to the session to record ten songs. What they ended up with is a double record; Side A features the eight originals and two covers they started with; Side B catapults these songs - with what life-long Smither fans may know as the Smither sound - into another dimension.\n\nProducer David Goodrich recalls, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Chris on a number of records over the past several years and I had a special feeling about this one going in. I didn\u2019t send out any roughs or lyrics to the guys ahead of time. As I said, I had a feeling. We walked in to the studio on June 23 and it became evident these ten songs were the foundation of something bigger.\u201d\n\nDuring the making of the record each musician each at some point wore different hats. Chris shook things up. The engineer played piano. The drummer played guitar. Chris took a Chuck Berry standard and turned it on its head and it came out in a minor key. They added in another surprise cover (you\u2019ll just have to listen to find out what it is). And to top it off, yes, Chris went electric.\n\nAt the core of CALL ME LUCKY are the ten songs. They offer commentary on the human condition that only Chris Smither can put pen to. These songs pull from deep in the soul that make for a kind of reflection \u2013 an introspection \u2013 that comes over someone only when facing a higher power or natural disaster. There\u2019s no choice but reflection. From the opening track of \u201cBlame\u2019s On Me\u201d to \u201cLower the Humble,\u201d Chris raises his own bar when it comes to his songwriting. The rollicking \u201cNobody Home\u201d offers a sharp observation of the 21st century while \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d reaches back to Chris\u2019 blues and folk roots as a young man.\n\nAs most Smither aficionados know, Chris recognizes great songs by other writers and always includes a couple of songs by other musicians. Chris\u2019 deftness as a song interpreter is often overlooked and yet his ability to choose a song and then make it his own is almost as important as his signature guitar styling and his command of the songwriting craft. Listen, you\u2019ll hear for yourself. Chris\u2019 2018 rendition of Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybellene\u201d is menacing.\n\nGoodrich goes on to say, \u201cThere have been some out there - like Bonnie Raitt, The Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, John Mayall, Diana Krall, and others \u2013 they not only know the strength of a Smither song, they get how coverable he is. Chris himself is the ultimate interpreter of others\u2019 songs, and being the songwriter he is, we thought, \u2018Let\u2019s have Smither cover Smither. So one afternoon we let loose and had some fun. Chris dug in and gave these songs new identities. An interpretation. That\u2019s how we ended up with the second disc.\u201d\n\nSide B of CALL ME LUCKY transcends the core record and takes the listener on an unexpected sonic journey. And mixing it all up is that surprise cover.\n\nAnd that is CALL ME LUCKY.\n\nFans from around the world continue to fill concert venue after concert venue eager for the galvanizing ride of a Chris Smither concert. Reviewers including the Associated Press, NPR, MOJO, and The New York Times agree that Chris remains a significant songwriter and an electrifying guitarist - an American original - as he draws deeply from folk and blues, modern poets and philosophers. And with CALL ME LUCKY Chris keeps doing just that. For some, a record like Chris\u2019 last release, the double CD 50-year career retrospective Still on the Levee would have been a monumental way to wrap up a long and successful career, to hang it up and go out on a high note.\n\nNot Chris Smither.\n\nAs he says, \u201cThis is what I do.\u201d\n\nEighteen records in, 83 songs over a lifetime, so far.\n\nCALL ME LUCKY is proof Chris Smither has more to offer.

The night we played Bonnaroo a couple years ago, I sat with my younger brother Sam, my wife Ellie, and a few other dear friends, reclining in plastic lawn chairs in the midnight Tennessee heat outside our tour bus, drinking wine and listening to music. After a decade of touring, (over 1700 shows) and making records, it\u2019s easy to forget the magic of music. We took turns introducing each other to new bands and artists, talking about our lives, our dreams, our failures. Music has always had a medicinal quality to me, and that\u2019s why I started writing songs and touring in the first place. I first needed the medicine when I was seventeen. I lost a brother that summer, 1999. He was a great kid, lived life from the view of a wheelchair, and was gone without warning a few days before his 14th birthday. I took lots of medicine, from Radiohead and Bob Dylan, from Pearl Jam and Otis Redding, from Bob Marley to the Temptations, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to Rage Against the Machine. I played the guitar in my bedroom, learned songs I loved, sang along in my car alone or with a friend. A year later I went to college in Knoxville and I became an addict. I was introduced to the medicine of Patty Griffin, Whiskeytown, Springsteen, Tom Waits, the Jayhawks, Wilco, Beck and hundreds more that could fill pages. I went and saw their shows and played their records over and over and over. The honesty, the intellect, the stories, the raw emotion, the rhythm, the vulnerability; it all made me feel like I was not alone. Music was a way of saying, \u201cme too,\u201da way of finding hope and meaning in the sorrow and confusion of life. Somewhere in those late college years, I started writing songs, at first feeble attempts, but it grew and grew, and I got better and better. I booked shows, I made myself vulnerable and stood onstage and sang earnest songs about love and joy, pain and tragedy. I convinced myself that making medicine was something I could take a swing at. After graduating, over a cup of coffee, I asked my dentist father what he thought about my dream, and he asked me one question, \u201cAre you going to work hard at that?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d I replied. \u201cWell let\u2019s go to the guitar shop and I\u2019ll buy you the best one I can afford.\u201d I hit the road, and I hit it hard. I found a band of agile, competent musicians whose musical library is vast and deep and demanding. Along the way, I married the girl I always wanted. She quit her teaching job and joined the band, toured with us for seven great years. We made several records, and spent the majority of the last decade on the road. You may have heard our music on TV. We\u2019ve had our songs on dozens of shows like Nashville, Parenthood, How I Met Your Mother. We have toured with artists like the Avett Brothers, John Hiatt, Needtobreathe, and a host of other kindred souls. We have sold out our own shows in places from Chicago to Austin, LA to New York, London to Denver, on stages we never dreamed we would play, and selling over 100,000 records in the process, all while staying independent. Our music is simple and heartfelt, built to inhabit people\u2019s day to day lives, like so many of the records I have loved over the long haul in my own life. Medicine is by far the best music we have ever made. When I played it for a respected friend, I asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d The response was, \u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s always been there.\u201d We recorded the whole album in eight days, co-produced by the band and Joe Pisapia (Ben Folds, KD Lang, Guster, Josh Rouse) at Joe\u2019s Middletree Studios, in East Nashville, about a mile from my house. We recorded one song at a time, until it was finished. No studio tricks, just me and a great band working together, creating, having fun, embracing the sorrow. It\u2019s always been about the song for us, a community of musicians surrounding that song and bringing it life, trying to make it sound like it has always been there.\nThe twelve songs on Medicine deal with loyalty, hardship, marriage, friendship, feeling like an outsider, and wrestling with God. \u201cYou\u2019ll Always Be My Girl\u201d is a love song to my bride Ellie, who after eight years on the road with us, is stepping away from the band. I came up with the first line when I was playing with our daughter Emmylou before putting her to bed. I wasn\u2019t trying to write a song, just entertaining her and I came up with the first line \u2013\u2018 from the start of spring to the autumn leaves, and the summers and winters between...\u201d After tucking her in, I dashed off the rest of the song in 45 minutes. It was the night before we went into the studio for the last time. When Ellie got home, I played it for her. She loved it, and we cried together for a moment and celebrated what we\u2019ve got and what we\u2019re grateful for. The next day, I taught it to the band, and we recorded the 24-hour-old song in one take. Nathan Dugger on piano, Rich Brinsfield on upright bass and me singing, just sitting in a circle. That ethos embodies the whole experience of making this record. \u201cShine Like Lightning\u201dis a song about us being an underdog band, never embraced by the powers of radio, major labels, large corporate sponsorships, and in light of that we have a healthy chip on our shoulder. But our music making has brought us, and our fans, a lot of happiness, it seems. This is an ode to ten years of doing it our own way, on our own terms, in spite of the roadblocks of cynicism and criticism, those who would \u201ctake something beautiful and make it feel small.\u201dIt\u2019s an anthem for our band and our fans, that we are going to \u201cShine Like Lightning!\u201d critics and cynics be damned. Breaking with my previous autobiographical songwriting bent, I wrote songs like \u201cHeartbreak\u201d and \u201cSister Brothers,\u201d based on the experiences of friends instead. Elsewhere, \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d looks back on the nostalgia and loss of a teenage romance. The grooving, call-and-response \u201cHere We Go\u201d was inspired by that particular night shared with friends at Bonnaroo. Medicine closes with\u201cWhen It\u2019 s All Said and Done.\u201dIt\u2019s about questioning whether God is real and whether he cares about us or not ... and not walking away from that, but holding on to it like you\u2019re hanging on to the side of a cliff, and that\u2019s where I find myself at this point. More than anything else, Medicine is born out of the stories we are told. The email from a fan who was on the verge on suicide but our song gave her glimmer of hope to keep hanging on.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nicole Zell ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:35 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.chescounitedmusicfestival.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SIDEPIECE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10185562.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Tech House, House", "Time": "1:40 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Just two below average guys who got together to make music we love, but don\u2019t tell our significant others.

Hailing from the Central Louisiana town of Alexandria, David has steadily built his reputation as an entertainer, playing high energy, musically diverse shows driven by what may be his biggest asset \u2013 that powerful, soul-drenched voice. America got a taste of David\u2019s promising talents when he made the finals of Nashville Star in 2007. Now David is delivering on that promise releasing brand new music showcasing what his followers across the country have been raving about for years.\nDavid\u2019s musical education began early in life as a kid. He was taking in the pop-influenced country sounds of Kenny Rogers from his dad\u2019s record collection before rocking out at Metallica and Guns-n-Roses concerts with his Junior High buddies. The new wave of 90\u2019s country, particularly Garth Brooks\u2019 seminal No Fences album, had a big impact on David. David\u2019s growing obsession for music soon gave way to performing for audiences; he says \u201cI never really wanted to do anything else besides singing and entertaining\u201d. Further musical explorations led David to expand his R&B vocal skills, singing in a Juniorr High group styled after the harmonies of Boyz II Men. By his early 20s David had started playing shows in nearby Hammond, La where he met a local producer. That chance meeting led to a few recording sessions and the beginning of David\u2019s trips to Nashville to take his first swing at the big time.\nIn early 2000, David made further connections in Music City and began working on his first full length album DSR with some of Country Music\u2019s top musicians and songwriters. Over the next few years David toured the country; performing frequently gave David an invaluable opportunity to develop his distinct vocal style and energy-driven live show. \u201cThere\u2019s an experience and wisdom in that environment,\u201d David says, \u201cyou learn to be professional at all times, whether you are playing for two people or a crowd of thousands\u201d.\nOpportunity came knocking in Spring 2007 when he was selected to star as a contestant on the new season of TV\u2019s premiere country competition Nashville Star. Besides the invaluable national exposure the show brought him, David also performed on the 40-city Nashville Star tour and had a chance to interact with many of the nearly half million fans who voted for him. Nashville Star also introduced David to many Music Row veterans, in particular Shawn Pennington, the former manager of mulit-platinum acts Big & Rich, Alabama\u2019s Randy Owen and new group Thompson Square. Shawn was very impressed with what he saw in David\u2019s live show during the Nashville Star tour. \u201cAt the time I was working with Big & Rich and their live show is what really set them apart. They owned the room every night and I\u2019ve seen David do that exact same thing,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cDavid can go into a room where no one knows his songs, and by the end, they are all giving him a standing ovation\u201d.\nBy 2008, David and Shawn were working together finding songs and beginning the process of recording a new album. David also continued collaborating on songs of his own with some of Nashville\u2019s top writers. All I Really Wanted to Say was the first album released on David\u2019s own independent label DSR Entertainment in 2010. His hit single \u201cTwenty Years Late\u201d rocketed to #56 on the Billboard Chart. David continues to successfully tour performing his own brand of country music to riveted crowds earning him a new legion of dedicated fans.\nDavid has also been hard at work writing, producing and recording his newest project due to release later this year. He explains, \u201cI hope this latest EP will show my fans the growth I\u2019ve made as a songwriter and artist, while exploring the depth of my musical influences. I really feel that this is the culmination of my journey up till this point.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Sunday, come enjoy some music and request songs in multiple places.\n\nYouTube\nwww.YouTube.com/davidstromain\n\nFacebook\nwww.fb.com/davidstromainmusic\n\nTwitch\nwww.twitch.tv/davidstromain"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kate Schettler ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10376748.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Latin Pop, Soul, Gospel, Pop, Blues", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Kate's blue-eyed soul style has elements of blues, jazz and soul fused together into an edgy pop sound.

Love is an art,\" sings Vanessa Carlton on the title track of her sixth album, Love Is An Art. Like the record itself, the song is a meditation on the eternal seesaw that is human connection: the push, the pull, the balance, the bottoming out. It's that constantly evolving nature of love, expectations and compassion that Carlton analyzes from all angles on Love Is An Art, from romantic, to parental, to the friends that hold us up and the leaders that repeatedly let us down. And on tracks like the album's opener, \"I Can't Stay the Same,\" that also includes the relationship with the person staring back at us in the mirror, each and every morning.\n\n\"Love is the energy you put out into the world,\" says the Nashville-based Carlton, who was inspired in part by the 1956 book The Art of Loving by philosopher Erich Fromm, and by stories and struggles both in her interior world and the world around her. \"And it can be so incredibly messy at times.\"\n\nProduced by Dave Fridmann (MGMT, Flaming Lips), Love Is An Art finds Carlton reckoning with toxic relationships (the confessional \"Miner's Canary\"), eternal partnership (\"Companion Star\") and the children who fill the world with love and grace while politicians fill their pockets (the passionate \"Die, Dinosaur,\" written after the shootings in Parkland, Florida). And true to Carlton\u2019s skill as both a lyricist and an instrumentalist, the arrangements on Love Is An Art tell these tales as vibrantly as the words themselves: piano parts that speak of rage and tenderness, synths that burst and glow like dawn.\n\nLove Is An Art doesn't just explore connections \u2013 it was also born of one. Carlton wrote the album with the acclaimed Nashville-based singer-songwriter Tristen, camped out and working while her daughter napped. \"This record is about being out of my comfort zone,\" says Carlton. \"What's going to happen when we do things that people assume are not naturally a match, like working with Dave Fridmann? I loved the idea of working with someone who\u2019s known for a palette that isn\u2019t associated with me, but it was a fit the second we started working together. Or what could happen when I sit with another writer, and just collaborate?\"\n\nThe result is an extremely dynamic LP filled with sticky melodies and haunting phrases as well as experimental constructions: super high highs, super low lows, and song structures that break the mold from the expected. Unlike her previous, critically-acclaimed 2015 album Liberman, which Carlton describes as having a calming, almost meditative palette, Love Is An Art reads, and sounds, \"red.\" Huge. Passionate. The color of a beating heart.\n\n\"I want to run, but I won\u2019t get very far,\" Carlton sings on \"The Only Way to Love,\" the album's first official single. \"Cause I can\u2019t fight the force of my young beating heart. Like a soldier's steady march, answering the call. It\u2019s the only way to love.\" It's a song about loving with everything you've got \u2013 that love itself is precious and rare enough to commit to, above all. \"When you believe in a relationship, in a connection, you are actually believing in yourself,\" she adds.\nCarlton has constantly challenged that belief, in both herself and the expectations that surround her throughout her lengthy, accomplished career: she attended both the School of American Ballet and Columbia University, and was discovered as a singer-songwriter/pianist when a cassette tape demo was given to legendary music impresario Ahmet Ertegun. With her debut single \"A Thousand Miles,\" Carlton soared to the top of the Billboard charts and garnered multiple Grammy nominations, though that song is only a small fraction of the body of work and artistic identity she's developed since then, ever evolving and growing as a performer and songwriter. In the summer of 2019, she pushed that even further, making her Broadway debut as Carole King in Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.\n\nThere's a striking image on the cover of Love Is An Art: it's a delicate hand grabbing a tiger by the tail, but it's not meant to conjure the familiar colloquialism. Instead, it captures something different. It\u2019s a about going after something bigger than you, more powerful than you, something that you\u2019ll never be able to really control: but you grab it anyway. Something like love. That's the spirit of Love Is An Art \u2013 connections aren\u2019t easy to make, and sometimes we fail. But it's always worth trying. As Carlton sings on \"Die, Dinosaur,\" the hope comes when there's nothing left to lose.\n\n\"Why not grab the wild animal?\" Carlton asks. \"And see what happens?\"", "otherInfo": "Tune in to TheMcCarltons station"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aya and Tyler ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10323653.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Jazz, Mantras, Deep House", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aya and Tyler, aka AYA Meditation is collectively made up of Aya Trenier and Tyler Sussman and known for their angelic, otherworldly voices.

In their desire to explore dualities, Deep Sea Diver urgently and deliberately move you from rock experimentation to dreamy soundscapes, Kraut-esque drum and bass grooves to angular danci-ness, and full fledged orchestration to bare bones simplicity. Dobson has the voice and authority to tie it all together, and turn it into a cohesive unit that soars yet remains beautifully delicate and intimate. Live, the band has received acclaim for their festival-ready power and presence, Jessica\u2019s larger than life guitar hooks, and their cascading layers that build upon each other until they reach their explosive peak.\n\nIn late 2013, Dobson put in her notice to former Shins boss, James Mercer, in order to give full attention to her own musical vision.

The night we played Bonnaroo a couple years ago, I sat with my younger brother Sam, my wife Ellie, and a few other dear friends, reclining in plastic lawn chairs in the midnight Tennessee heat outside our tour bus, drinking wine and listening to music. After a decade of touring, (over 1700 shows) and making records, it\u2019s easy to forget the magic of music. We took turns introducing each other to new bands and artists, talking about our lives, our dreams, our failures. Music has always had a medicinal quality to me, and that\u2019s why I started writing songs and touring in the first place. I first needed the medicine when I was seventeen. I lost a brother that summer, 1999. He was a great kid, lived life from the view of a wheelchair, and was gone without warning a few days before his 14th birthday. I took lots of medicine, from Radiohead and Bob Dylan, from Pearl Jam and Otis Redding, from Bob Marley to the Temptations, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to Rage Against the Machine. I played the guitar in my bedroom, learned songs I loved, sang along in my car alone or with a friend. A year later I went to college in Knoxville and I became an addict. I was introduced to the medicine of Patty Griffin, Whiskeytown, Springsteen, Tom Waits, the Jayhawks, Wilco, Beck and hundreds more that could fill pages. I went and saw their shows and played their records over and over and over. The honesty, the intellect, the stories, the raw emotion, the rhythm, the vulnerability; it all made me feel like I was not alone. Music was a way of saying, \u201cme too,\u201da way of finding hope and meaning in the sorrow and confusion of life. Somewhere in those late college years, I started writing songs, at first feeble attempts, but it grew and grew, and I got better and better. I booked shows, I made myself vulnerable and stood onstage and sang earnest songs about love and joy, pain and tragedy. I convinced myself that making medicine was something I could take a swing at. After graduating, over a cup of coffee, I asked my dentist father what he thought about my dream, and he asked me one question, \u201cAre you going to work hard at that?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d I replied. \u201cWell let\u2019s go to the guitar shop and I\u2019ll buy you the best one I can afford.\u201d I hit the road, and I hit it hard. I found a band of agile, competent musicians whose musical library is vast and deep and demanding. Along the way, I married the girl I always wanted. She quit her teaching job and joined the band, toured with us for seven great years. We made several records, and spent the majority of the last decade on the road. You may have heard our music on TV. We\u2019ve had our songs on dozens of shows like Nashville, Parenthood, How I Met Your Mother. We have toured with artists like the Avett Brothers, John Hiatt, Needtobreathe, and a host of other kindred souls. We have sold out our own shows in places from Chicago to Austin, LA to New York, London to Denver, on stages we never dreamed we would play, and selling over 100,000 records in the process, all while staying independent. Our music is simple and heartfelt, built to inhabit people\u2019s day to day lives, like so many of the records I have loved over the long haul in my own life. Medicine is by far the best music we have ever made. When I played it for a respected friend, I asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d The response was, \u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s always been there.\u201d We recorded the whole album in eight days, co-produced by the band and Joe Pisapia (Ben Folds, KD Lang, Guster, Josh Rouse) at Joe\u2019s Middletree Studios, in East Nashville, about a mile from my house. We recorded one song at a time, until it was finished. No studio tricks, just me and a great band working together, creating, having fun, embracing the sorrow. It\u2019s always been about the song for us, a community of musicians surrounding that song and bringing it life, trying to make it sound like it has always been there.\nThe twelve songs on Medicine deal with loyalty, hardship, marriage, friendship, feeling like an outsider, and wrestling with God. \u201cYou\u2019ll Always Be My Girl\u201d is a love song to my bride Ellie, who after eight years on the road with us, is stepping away from the band. I came up with the first line when I was playing with our daughter Emmylou before putting her to bed. I wasn\u2019t trying to write a song, just entertaining her and I came up with the first line \u2013\u2018 from the start of spring to the autumn leaves, and the summers and winters between...\u201d After tucking her in, I dashed off the rest of the song in 45 minutes. It was the night before we went into the studio for the last time. When Ellie got home, I played it for her. She loved it, and we cried together for a moment and celebrated what we\u2019ve got and what we\u2019re grateful for. The next day, I taught it to the band, and we recorded the 24-hour-old song in one take. Nathan Dugger on piano, Rich Brinsfield on upright bass and me singing, just sitting in a circle. That ethos embodies the whole experience of making this record. \u201cShine Like Lightning\u201dis a song about us being an underdog band, never embraced by the powers of radio, major labels, large corporate sponsorships, and in light of that we have a healthy chip on our shoulder. But our music making has brought us, and our fans, a lot of happiness, it seems. This is an ode to ten years of doing it our own way, on our own terms, in spite of the roadblocks of cynicism and criticism, those who would \u201ctake something beautiful and make it feel small.\u201dIt\u2019s an anthem for our band and our fans, that we are going to \u201cShine Like Lightning!\u201d critics and cynics be damned. Breaking with my previous autobiographical songwriting bent, I wrote songs like \u201cHeartbreak\u201d and \u201cSister Brothers,\u201d based on the experiences of friends instead. Elsewhere, \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d looks back on the nostalgia and loss of a teenage romance. The grooving, call-and-response \u201cHere We Go\u201d was inspired by that particular night shared with friends at Bonnaroo. Medicine closes with\u201cWhen It\u2019 s All Said and Done.\u201dIt\u2019s about questioning whether God is real and whether he cares about us or not ... and not walking away from that, but holding on to it like you\u2019re hanging on to the side of a cliff, and that\u2019s where I find myself at this point. More than anything else, Medicine is born out of the stories we are told. The email from a fan who was on the verge on suicide but our song gave her glimmer of hope to keep hanging on. The story by the bus of fans who danced their first dance to another one of our songs. The mom who sings our music to her kids before they go to sleep, begging for peace and health and a happy life. The people who dance in the back of the rock club and have a moment of joy in a world of suffering. We only hope to add to the soundtrack, in the same way that all those artists and bands have done for me. Making medicine, Music, it makes you feel good, makes you feel understood like you\u2019 re not alone, not a rolling stone, you\u2019 re not the only one on the road.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Travis Denning ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8809895.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born out of Middle Georgia, Travis Denning has been crafting his skills as a musician and as a songwriter for close to 10 years now.

Hailing from the Central Louisiana town of Alexandria, David has steadily built his reputation as an entertainer, playing high energy, musically diverse shows driven by what may be his biggest asset \u2013 that powerful, soul-drenched voice. America got a taste of David\u2019s promising talents when he made the finals of Nashville Star in 2007. Now David is delivering on that promise releasing brand new music showcasing what his followers across the country have been raving about for years.\nDavid\u2019s musical education began early in life as a kid. He was taking in the pop-influenced country sounds of Kenny Rogers from his dad\u2019s record collection before rocking out at Metallica and Guns-n-Roses concerts with his Junior High buddies. The new wave of 90\u2019s country, particularly Garth Brooks\u2019 seminal No Fences album, had a big impact on David. David\u2019s growing obsession for music soon gave way to performing for audiences; he says \u201cI never really wanted to do anything else besides singing and entertaining\u201d. Further musical explorations led David to expand his R&B vocal skills, singing in a Juniorr High group styled after the harmonies of Boyz II Men. By his early 20s David had started playing shows in nearby Hammond, La where he met a local producer. That chance meeting led to a few recording sessions and the beginning of David\u2019s trips to Nashville to take his first swing at the big time.\nIn early 2000, David made further connections in Music City and began working on his first full length album DSR with some of Country Music\u2019s top musicians and songwriters. Over the next few years David toured the country; performing frequently gave David an invaluable opportunity to develop his distinct vocal style and energy-driven live show. \u201cThere\u2019s an experience and wisdom in that environment,\u201d David says, \u201cyou learn to be professional at all times, whether you are playing for two people or a crowd of thousands\u201d.\nOpportunity came knocking in Spring 2007 when he was selected to star as a contestant on the new season of TV\u2019s premiere country competition Nashville Star. Besides the invaluable national exposure the show brought him, David also performed on the 40-city Nashville Star tour and had a chance to interact with many of the nearly half million fans who voted for him. Nashville Star also introduced David to many Music Row veterans, in particular Shawn Pennington, the former manager of mulit-platinum acts Big & Rich, Alabama\u2019s Randy Owen and new group Thompson Square. Shawn was very impressed with what he saw in David\u2019s live show during the Nashville Star tour. \u201cAt the time I was working with Big & Rich and their live show is what really set them apart. They owned the room every night and I\u2019ve seen David do that exact same thing,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cDavid can go into a room where no one knows his songs, and by the end, they are all giving him a standing ovation\u201d.\nBy 2008, David and Shawn were working together finding songs and beginning the process of recording a new album. David also continued collaborating on songs of his own with some of Nashville\u2019s top writers. All I Really Wanted to Say was the first album released on David\u2019s own independent label DSR Entertainment in 2010. His hit single \u201cTwenty Years Late\u201d rocketed to #56 on the Billboard Chart. David continues to successfully tour performing his own brand of country music to riveted crowds earning him a new legion of dedicated fans.\nDavid has also been hard at work writing, producing and recording his newest project due to release later this year. He explains, \u201cI hope this latest EP will show my fans the growth I\u2019ve made as a songwriter and artist, while exploring the depth of my musical influences. I really feel that this is the culmination of my journey up till this point.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Sunday, come enjoy some music and request songs in multiple places.\n\nYouTube\nwww.YouTube.com/davidstromain\n\nFacebook\nwww.fb.com/davidstromainmusic\n\nTwitch\nwww.twitch.tv/davidstromain"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vanessa Carlton ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9943893.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Alterna-pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Always building up, falling apart. Love is an art,\" sings Vanessa Carlton on the title track of her sixth album, Love Is An Art. Like the record itself, the song is a meditation on the eternal seesaw that is human connection: the push, the pull, the balance, the bottoming out. It's that constantly evolving nature of love, expectations and compassion that Carlton analyzes from all angles on Love Is An Art, from romantic, to parental, to the friends that hold us up and the leaders that repeatedly let us down. And on tracks like the album's opener, \"I Can't Stay the Same,\" that also includes the relationship with the person staring back at us in the mirror, each and every morning.\n\n\"Love is the energy you put out into the world,\" says the Nashville-based Carlton, who was inspired in part by the 1956 book The Art of Loving by philosopher Erich Fromm, and by stories and struggles both in her interior world and the world around her. \"And it can be so incredibly messy at times.\"\n\nProduced by Dave Fridmann (MGMT, Flaming Lips), Love Is An Art finds Carlton reckoning with toxic relationships (the confessional \"Miner's Canary\"), eternal partnership (\"Companion Star\") and the children who fill the world with love and grace while politicians fill their pockets (the passionate \"Die, Dinosaur,\" written after the shootings in Parkland, Florida). And true to Carlton\u2019s skill as both a lyricist and an instrumentalist, the arrangements on Love Is An Art tell these tales as vibrantly as the words themselves: piano parts that speak of rage and tenderness, synths that burst and glow like dawn.\n\nLove Is An Art doesn't just explore connections \u2013 it was also born of one. Carlton wrote the album with the acclaimed Nashville-based singer-songwriter Tristen, camped out and working while her daughter napped. \"This record is about being out of my comfort zone,\" says Carlton. \"What's going to happen when we do things that people assume are not naturally a match, like working with Dave Fridmann? I loved the idea of working with someone who\u2019s known for a palette that isn\u2019t associated with me, but it was a fit the second we started working together. Or what could happen when I sit with another writer, and just collaborate?\"\n\nThe result is an extremely dynamic LP filled with sticky melodies and haunting phrases as well as experimental constructions: super high highs, super low lows, and song structures that break the mold from the expected. Unlike her previous, critically-acclaimed 2015 album Liberman, which Carlton describes as having a calming, almost meditative palette, Love Is An Art reads, and sounds, \"red.\" Huge. Passionate. The color of a beating heart.\n\n\"I want to run, but I won\u2019t get very far,\" Carlton sings on \"The Only Way to Love,\" the album's first official single. \"Cause I can\u2019t fight the force of my young beating heart. Like a soldier's steady march, answering the call. It\u2019s the only way to love.\" It's a song about loving with everything you've got \u2013 that love itself is precious and rare enough to commit to, above all. \"When you believe in a relationship, in a connection, you are actually believing in yourself,\" she adds.\nCarlton has constantly challenged that belief, in both herself and the expectations that surround her throughout her lengthy, accomplished career: she attended both the School of American Ballet and Columbia University, and was discovered as a singer-songwriter/pianist when a cassette tape demo was given to legendary music impresario Ahmet Ertegun. With her debut single \"A Thousand Miles,\" Carlton soared to the top of the Billboard charts and garnered multiple Grammy nominations, though that song is only a small fraction of the body of work and artistic identity she's developed since then, ever evolving and growing as a performer and songwriter. In the summer of 2019, she pushed that even further, making her Broadway debut as Carole King in Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.\n\nThere's a striking image on the cover of Love Is An Art: it's a delicate hand grabbing a tiger by the tail, but it's not meant to conjure the familiar colloquialism. Instead, it captures something different. It\u2019s a about going after something bigger than you, more powerful than you, something that you\u2019ll never be able to really control: but you grab it anyway. Something like love. That's the spirit of Love Is An Art \u2013 connections aren\u2019t easy to make, and sometimes we fail. But it's always worth trying. As Carlton sings on \"Die, Dinosaur,\" the hope comes when there's nothing left to lose.\n\n\"Why not grab the wild animal?\" Carlton asks. \"And see what happens?\"", "otherInfo": "Tune in to TheMcCarltons station"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Deep Sea Diver ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6877541.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWide awake, and I\u2019m chasing after you\u201d\u2014exclaims a breathless Jessica Dobson, singer and multi-instrumentalist of Seattle\u2019s Deep Sea Diver. The lyric is one that best encapsulates the front woman\u2019s bravado and fearlessness which dominates Deep Sea Diver\u2019s forthcoming sophomore LP, Secrets\u2014Out February 19th on their own High Beam records. In their desire to explore dualities, Deep Sea Diver urgently and deliberately move you from rock experimentation to dreamy soundscapes, Kraut-esque drum and bass grooves to angular danci-ness, and full fledged orchestration to bare bones simplicity. Dobson has the voice and authority to tie it all together, and turn it into a cohesive unit that soars yet remains beautifully delicate and intimate. Live, the band has received acclaim for their festival-ready power and presence, Jessica\u2019s larger than life guitar hooks, and their cascading layers that build upon each other until they reach their explosive peak.\n\nIn late 2013, Dobson put in her notice to former Shins boss, James Mercer, in order to give full attention to her own musical vision.

But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans.

Perhaps the greatest element of David Guetta\u2019s illustrious story is not simply his countless personal successes, but his wider game-changing approach. From making dance music and DJ culture more of a viable and legitimised commercial success than ever before to finally uniting the worlds of electronic and urban music, the repercussions of his visionary attitude cannot be underestimated.\n\nDavid has established himself as arguably the world\u2019s biggest and most successful DJ of all time by fusing dance music with urban artists. By teaming up with some of the biggest names in hip hop and R&B, and reinventing their sound for the electronic dancefloors, Guetta created pop alchemy. The ensuing hits such as \u2018I Gotta Feeling\u2019 with Black Eyed Peas, \u2018When Love Takes Over\u2019 with Kelly Rowland and \u2018Sexy Bitch\u2019 with Akon propelled him to superstardom. They also set a new template for the sound of commercial radio. This was instrumental in turning electronic music into the biggest youth movement since hip hop.\n\nOf course, his own groundbreaking accomplishments cannot be overlooked either. 50 million album and single sales; over 10 billion YouTube and Spotify plays; numerous #1 singles and Platinum and Gold certifications across the globe; two Grammys for Best Remixed Recording and four further nominations; one of the most successful club nights Ibiza has ever seen; one of the biggest social media followings of any DJ/producer; the first DJ to be on the cover of Billboard, the list goes on and on and on\u2026\n\nWith all his success as a chart-topping producer, it\u2019s all too easy to forget about his hallowed heritage as a highly respected DJ. Promoting raves in his native Paris with nothing more than photocopied flyers, he rose through the influential \u2018French touch\u2019 era that saw the likes of Daft Punk come to fame, but was soon forging his own path through the dance music scene. Whether he\u2019s playing at one of his residencies at XS and Encore in Las Vegas or Ushua\u00efa Ibiza or playing mega festivals like Tomorrowland (where he has performed since its first year) and Ultra Music Festival, he never forgets those humble roots. His \u2018classical\u2019 training in the art of mixing combined with his enduring appeal and continual relevancy ensured him the #6 spot on the DJ Mag Top 100 and a Billboard award for Top Dance/Electronic artist most recently.\n\nCiting his role in the studio in the vein of a classic producer, Guetta sits as the musical brain at the center of the project, bringing it all together. His incredible list of collaborators over the years has included Madonna, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Usher, Sia, John Legend, Nicki Minaj, Kelly Rowland, Showtek, Avicii, Ne-Yo, Akon, Afrojack and Nicky Romero for starters, but he has also been a keen supporter of lesser-known talent. The likes of Sam Martin and Chris Willis have both enjoyed continual support from Guetta, showing that he\u2019s not just about the A-listers but also about championing hot new names. \u201cOf course it\u2019s amazing to work with famous people,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut the reason behind their fame is their talent. But I also love finding talented people who are not famous, it\u2019s equally amazing to put the spotlight on them.\u201d\n\nAlways in high demand outside of the clubs, festivals and studios, Guetta\u2019s extra-curricular activities have ranged from providing the original soundtrack and musical direction for the UEFA Euro 2016 football championship to being a key partner for UNICEF and an early supporter of groundbreaking legal mix uploading platform Dubset. Never hesitating to help charities, David joined forces with the United Nations in support of \u2018\u2019The World Needs More\u2019\u2019 campaign to raise funds for humanitarian emergencies.\n\nOne of his latest releases Would I Lie To You is seeing him return to the club dancefloors, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019ll never be defined by just one side of his career. His passion for music remains undying, and while the world continues to watch his every move with anticipation, he\u2019ll ignore the pressure and continue his ongoing search for that perfect beat.\n\nHis latest release Shed A Light is a dance pop ballad that is bound to leave a lasting impression across the globe. The track shot to the charts and has reached a Golden status in Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden up until now. More than anything the deeply moving song sends a message of hope, urging us to heed the call of our hearts. The track has the emotional fire that Guetta aims for in all his productions.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/insomniac"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Zach Matari ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9071729.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "R&b Soul", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Humble, kind, courteous and authentic are just a few of the words you will hear fans use to describe Zach Matari!\n\nZach Matari, the \u201cNew\u201d Jersey Boy, Pop/R&B singer/songwriter sensation & musician born and raised in North Jersey with musical talent that is far beyond his years.

Catching his break after winning a Beatport remix contest in 2012 with his dubstep-\nfocused version of Above & Beyond\u2019s \u201cYou Got to Go\u201d, Seven Lions, born Jeff Montalvo, garnered early support\nfrom the likes of Skrillex and his OWSLA label. 2013 tour dates with Porter Robinson and Krewella pushed\nMontalvo and his genre-bending production style to the forefront of the modern electronic music scene.\nPutting sheer technical production prowess to work in soulful, deep, hybridized creations all distinctly his\nown, the multi-talented musician is single-handedly changing the sonic landscape for future generations to come\nby bridging the gap between the soaring, ethereal vibe of trance and intensely adrenalizing bass music. His\nproductions have seen stages at world-renowned festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival\n(New York and Las Vegas), Electric Forrest, Electric Zoo, South by Southwest, and HARD.\nAfter several successful releases under the OWSLA label (his debut EP, Days to Come, reached #2 on\nthe iTunes Dance charts), Montalvo released his highly anticipated 2014 follow-up EP, Worlds Apart, on Republic\nRecords\u2019 dance imprint Casablanca. Containing several notable features which include Ellie Goulding and Tove\nLo, Worlds Apart debuted at #1 on the iTunes Dance charts, and the title track was also featured in Billboard\u2019s\n\u201cTop 10 Electronic/Dance Songs of 2014\u201d list. The EP also featured the smash hit and canonical dance track\n\u2018Strangers\u2019, featuring superstar vocalist Tove Lo. \u2018Strangers\u2019 was a definitive track in what was perhaps the peak\nof American electronic dance music, and solidified Seven Lions as one of the scene\u2019s premier artists.\nIn 2015, Seven Lions began releasing music in EP formats, devoting each EP to a cohesive idea and\nworld found within the Seven Lions universe. 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Throes of Winter\u201d hints at a larger seasonal theme, to\nbe continued through to his future releases. When asked about the spark for this vision, he explains, \"Since\nartists aren't releasing proper albums anymore, it makes sense to create something that's digitally artistic with real\ncohesion as opposed to tossing out singles and just haphazardly seeing what sticks\u2026 I wanted to start making\nthe music more thematic, interesting, and part of something larger.\u201d\nBucking more trends and breaking from convention, his 2016 Creation EP [Casablanca Records] followed\na different path for his latest body of work. \u201cThis time, songwriting really took place on guitar,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\nare more acoustic elements in the songs, and that ties it together. I wanted to get a little more experimental. I\ndidn\u2019t worry if something was going to be a big banger on the dancefloor or not. I just made what felt right at the\ntime.\u201d Ultimately, Seven Lions continues challenging himself and musical genres. \u201cI want to do something\ndifferent,\u201d he concludes. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to fit into just one genre. I want people to walk away loving\ndifferent kinds of music and sounds.\u201d\nThis year saw Seven Lions once more travel across the country on his There and Back Again club-\nfocused tour, in addition to hallmark festival appearances at Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, EDC\nJapan, Middlelands, Electric Zoo, and Paradiso, amongst others. This summer the sound-sculptor unveiled his\nhighly-anticipated Where I Wont Be Found EP as well, continuing his always growing world, identified via these\nannual EP projects. The eight-track offering is a wondrous journey from start to. From the heavily streamed and\ncritically praised \u201cFreesol,\u201d to the energetic future bass collaboration \u201cRescue Me\u201d with scene upstart Unlike Pluto,\nWhere I Wont Be Found reminds fans of what made Seven Lions who he is today - a singular talent in electronic\nmusic, and a producer who has always forged his own lane.\nIn support of the EP and the year as a whole, Seven Lions will wrap up 2017 with a 20 date North\nAmerican headlining tour with Tritonal (and Kill The Noise as support). Playing some of America\u2019s largest\ntheatres, the Horizon Tour hits LA (2 nights at the iconic Palladium), NYC (Brooklyn\u2019s Hangar), Boston,\nPhiladelphia, San Francisco (Bill Graham), Toronto, and many other key locales.\n\nJeff started 2018 in a new direction \u2013 his very own record label. Called Ophelia Records, the imprint has\nalready seen a handful of strong releases: Calling You Home, Ocean, and Horizon. \u2018Ocean\u2019 in particular has\nalready cemented itself as a quintessential Seven Lions track, racking up over 1.7 million Spotify streams in just a\nfew weeks. He has also expanded on his touring business, unveiling the \u2018Chronicles\u2019 concept \u2013 an event series\nthat takes the Seven Lions experience and kicks it up a notch. It\u2019s an immersive experience \u2013 filled with art\ninstallations, local vendors, unique characters, and secrets, pulled straight out of the world of Seven Lions.

They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL.

In the wake of the conflagration, future possibilities flourish out of the ashes.\nReigniting a brotherhood dating back nearly two decades, As I Lay Dying rise together on their seventh\nfull-length and debut for Nuclear Blast, the aptly titled Shaped By Fire. The San Diego quintet\u2014Tim\nLambesis [vocals], Jordan Mancino [drums], Phil Sgrosso [guitar], Nick Hipa [guitar], and Josh Gilbert\n[bass]\u2014rally together and recharge the precise and pummeling metallic assault that transformed them\ninto a turn-of-the-century heavy music phenomenon.\n\nThese eleven tracks mark their first body of work together since 2012 and represent the dawn of a bold\nnew era.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is the most meaningful As I Lay Dying record,\u201d states Nick. \u201cEvery album encapsulates who\nyou are and what you\u2019ve gone through. At this point in time, we\u2019ve gone through more than I ever\nimagined, but we all grew. I\u2019m so proud of my bandmates and what we\u2019ve done. We became better\nmusicians and better people. People will hear a positive resolve to our journey so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith everything that\u2019s happened and all of the time away, there really was no other option than to be\nthe best version of As I Lay Dying we could possibly be,\u201d Tim declares. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we\nmade an album that represented our best selves. Individually and collectively, a similar rebirth\nhappened.\u201d\n\nThe rebirth remains rooted in an impressive legacy. Since forming in 2000, the group sold over 1 million\nalbums worldwide, garnered a 2008 GRAMMY\u00ae Award nomination in the category of \u201cBest Metal\nPerformance,\u201d notched two Top 10 debuts on the Billboard Top 200, generated hundreds of millions of\nstreams, sold out shows around the globe, and took home \u201cUltimate Metal God\u201d at MTV2\u2019s Music\nAwards in 2007. Following a five-year hiatus amidst personal struggles, the musicians reconnected in\nearly 2018.\n\nBefore a note of music, they focused on where everything began: the friendship.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to ease into things,\u201d recalls Phil. \u201cWe connected as friends again first. Then, we began to\ndiscuss what we could do musically. A lot of ideas floated around, and we decided to do a show in San\nDiego.\u201d\n\nThe show, which rapidly sold out in two minutes, served as the first in a series of \u201csmall goals,\u201d as Josh\nputs it. Backed by overwhelming support, they recorded and unleashed the hard-hitting \u201cMy Own\nGrave,\u201d which clocked 13 million Spotify streams in a few months\u2019 time. Concurrently, the musicians\nwrote and recorded what would become Shaped By Fire, taking the reins in terms of production and\nengineering with a little help from longtime friend and collaborator Killswitch Engage\u2019s Adam D. This\ntime around, recording happened individually, allowing for the best possible performances. Meanwhile,\ncommunication was at an all-time high as a respectful atmosphere encouraged constructive criticism.\n\n\u201cEveryone wanted to expand the sound, but keep it somewhat familiar,\u201d Phil says. \u201cIt had been six years\nsince we worked together. We realized what our strengths were internally and honed in on how to\nperfect them as much as possible. We trimmed the fat and filler and added different textures and\nlayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy tracking myself, I was able to get comfortable and best represent my own ideas at the beginning,\u201d\nadds Tim. \u201cWe found a new sense of respect for each other musically and personally. We connected\nbetter than ever.\u201d\n\nThe first single and title track \u201cShaped By Fire\u201d steamrolls forward on airtight riffing and bludgeoning\ndrums before a soaring arena-size refrain.\n\n\u201cThe chorus sums up the collective band experience over the last seven years,\u201d Tim admits. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty\ndirect.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the opener \u201cBlinded\u201d gallops forward with undeniable urgency as it poses questions for the\nfrontman. \u201cI\u2019m asking, \u2018Can there be change?\u2019,\u201d continues Tim. \u201cI want to show people over time it\u2019s\npossible.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, \u201cTorn Between\u201d tempers pensive lyrics and robust musicality as it discusses an internal\ndivide. \u201cA lot of times, we feel like we have two options and need to choose one or the other,\u201d he goes.\n\u201cSometimes, the third option is the best. I was between this blackened heart and a blue, bruised, and\nbeaten heart. The song concludes on getting rid of them both and starting from scratch.\u201d\n\nFittingly, Shaped by Fire culminates on what might be the record\u2019s heaviest catharsis emotionally, \u201cThe\nToll It Takes.\u201d A stark admission cuts deep as they lock into what Phil dubs, \u201ca special moment.\u201d\n\nIn the end, As I Lay Dying burn brighter than ever before.\n\n\u201cThis is the next chapter,\u201d affirms Tim. \u201cI\u2019m more excited for the overall direction we\u2019re heading in than\nI\u2019ve ever been. Hopefully, our fans can sense that when they hear this record. The As I Lay Dying story is\nin an exciting place in this moment and time, but there\u2019s even more to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that music can obviously touch people and change their lives for the better,\u201d Phil concludes. \u201cSo,\nfor anyone who is going through a hard time, if they were to hear this record, it would do something\npositive for their lives, or it would help motivate them. The power of music is so strong that maybe this\nwould help somebody who needed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope people feel empowered by this,\u201d Nick agrees. \u201cWe always put so much love into what we do.\nThere\u2019s the optimism of being able to turn things around, heal, grow, and persevere.

For Sam, his writing is a vehicle that often serves to document darkness, but predominantly is also concerned with finding beauty, however hard that may be. A multi-instrumentalist, his songwriting process is personal (perhaps sacred), often cathartic but rarely a collaborative experience. However in terms of recording and performance, Sam has very much an open-door policy, inviting friends to join him wherever and whenever possible. While Sam may claim otherwise, his music feels inextricably bound in the concept of \u201chiraeth\u201d, a Welsh-language word for which there is no direct translation. This idea is something that constantly and perhaps subconsciously informs and underlies his work; a sense of nostalgia, homesickness tinged with grief, and a longing for the past - maybe more specifically his own past and upbringing on Anglesey, an island off the north-west coast of Wales. However, Sam would argue his music rarely exists in just one place, whether in a geographical or musical sense. It is both stark and expansive, something he hopes is also reflected in the live show when joined by a full band, while still retaining the pin-drop reverie that his solo performances have been credited with. His debut album \u201cIn Darkened Rooms\u201d is a collection of songs that have led Sam to this moment in time. \u201cI guess usually a debut record is a snapshot from a certain time in an artist\u2019s career..\u201d, says Sam, \u201cbut as this was made over a longer period than most I think stylistically maybe reflects a wider palette of influence, and as a result it sees me sonically exploring a few different routes\u201d. The result is a record that audibly draws inspiration from a number of places, including confessional indie-folk, post-rock, americana, and traditional folk music, along with other cultural and literary influences. But ultimately, says Sam \u201cit all still comes from the same voice - these are my songs, and I live and die by them\u201d. In light of this, many of these tracks are recent but some have had different lives, and the hope is that they will continue to do so. Sam is very much of the belief that a studio recording doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the definitive version of a song, and with this in mind he often changes arrangements for live performances too. This concept has also extended to his time in the studio where over time he learnt not to be overly precious with his initial visions for songs and their structures, something gained partly by watching the Wilco documentary \u201cI Am Trying To Break Your Heart\u201d. The title of the record is a lyric taken from the track \u201cIn The Morning\u201d but also reflects the winter period during which Sam finished writing the record. Despite for the past few years living in the musically-rich but landlocked city of Leeds, Sam returned to the coastlines of North Wales where he spent a week alone, overlooking the mountain range of Snowdonia (which is depicted in the cover art, shot by longtime friend and collaborator Sam Bond). Between sessions he would gather his thoughts on long walks, and was struck by just how quickly and dramatically the light and scenery could change. Consequently, Sam took his ideas back to Leeds where he recorded with producer and friend Whiskas, engineer Paul Thompson, and the help of his bandmates and musical friends. Older songs are revisited on the record; the lyrics to intro track \u201cCamera Lens\u201d taken from a poem written by Sam as a teenager, and the inclusion of \u201cThe Blackout\u201d, an early single which on its initial release was named BBC Radio Wales\u2019 track of the year. The newest songs, however, hint at a future musical direction - from the bravely sparse and introspective \u201cLacuna\u201d (partly inspired by watching Michel Gondry\u2019s \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d), to album closer \u201cNantucket\u201d, with its slow build, whispered harmonies, and its textured, crashing finale. Along the way there have been both triumphs and setbacks, and while Sam is the first to admit that this process has taken considerably longer than he\u2019d have hoped, his own record has not always been the only priority. Sam co-runs respected Leeds-based label Hide & Seek Records, and in the past year alone has overseen releases from Post War Glamour Girls, Dancing Years, Mi Mye, and Department M, 3 of which were albums. In the past few years, Sam has been booked to play festivals such as Latitude, Leeds festival, Festival No 6, Kendal Calling and Bluedot Festival, and most recently has played multiple sold-out dates on tour with Matthew & the Atlas. In many ways a songwriter\u2019s songwriter, his musical admirers include Midlake, Damien Jurado, Sharon Van Etten, Daughter and Anais Mitchell, most of which he has shared a stage with, along with shows and tours with the likes of The Low Anthem, Villagers, Willy Mason, Lucy Rose and Benjamin Francis Leftwich. In Leeds, Sam has gathered huge crowds at headline shows and festival appearances, including playing the city\u2019s prestigious town hall, and most recently a special sold-out show at Holy Trinity Church, an ambitious collaboration with friends performing Bon Iver\u2019s \u201cFor Emma, Forever Ago\u201d in full, an event endorsed by Justin Vernon himself. In addition to this, Sam has also benefited from support and radio plays, interviews and live sessions on many shows across the BBC network, and his champions include Huw Stephens (BBC R1), Lauren Laverne (BBC 6 Music), Steve Lamacq (BBC 6 Music/R2), along with continual support from BBC Radio Wales\u2019 Adam Walton and Bethan Elfyn. In relation to the making and release of his record, Sam stressed the importance of \u201cthe time needing to feel right, which hasn\u2019t always been the case\u201d. Eventually, though, you have to let things go, to put them out into the world and just see what happens\u201d. For Sam, this certainly feels like the time.

His forthcoming 16th studio album, \"What Happens Next\" (due out Jan 12, 2018), is already picking up rave reviews as yet another creative breakthrough \u2013 this for a guitarist who has routinely topped guitar magazine polls since the release of his first full-length album, \"Not Of This Earth\", in 1986.\n\nSince September 18, 1970 (the day his idol Jimi Hendrix passed away), Satriani has dedicated himself to the artistry of the instrument. While still a teenager in his hometown of Westbury, New York, he taught guitar to another budding six-string hopeful, Steve Vai. A few years later, Satriani moved to San Francisco and played guitar in a popular new wave band, The Squares, and briefly joined The Greg Kihn Band before the release of \"Not Of This Earth\".\n\nSatriani\u2019s reputation was already growing in guitar circles \u2013 along with Vai, some of his other students were Metallica\u2019s Kirk Hammett and Testament\u2019s Alex Skolnick \u2013 but in 1987, he broke through to the masses with his second studio full-length, \"Surfing With The Alien\", a massive seller (it hit No. 29 on the Billboard 200) that included the radio hits \u201cSatch Boogie\u201d and the title track. The success of that album caught the attention of Mick Jagger, who asked Satriani to be his lead guitarist on his first-ever solo tour, in 1988.\n\nAs a live performer, Satriani has toured the world with each new release (his last concert tour for 2013\u2019s \"Unstoppable Momentum\" saw the guitarist touch down in 32 countries). In 1993, he joined Deep Purple as a temporary replacement for Ritchie Blackmore during a Japanese tour. In 1996, Satriani founded the multi-guitarist traveling experience called G3, which has seen him share stages with Vai, Eric Johnson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Robert Fripp, among others. And starting in 2009, Satriani traversed the globe again as a member of Chickenfoot. The all-star band (which also includes singer Sammy Hagar, former Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith) has issued two albums, their debut and 2011\u2019s follow-up, \"Chickenfoot III\".\n\nSatriani\u2019s solo discography includes a host of classics, including 1989\u2019s \"Flying In A Blue Dream\", \"The Extremist\" from 1992, \"Is There Love In Space?\" (2004) and 2010\u2019s \"Black Swans And Wormhole Wizards\". His 15 Grammy nominations have been for songs such as \u201cAlways With Me, Always With You,\u201d \u201cThe Crush Of Love,\u201d and \u201cSummer Song,\u201d as well as full albums like \"Surfing With The Alien\", \"The Extremist\" and \"Super Colossal\".\n\nSatriani has appeared in motion pictures such as Christopher Guest\u2019s 2006 release, \"For Your Consideration\", and the 2011 Brad Pitt starrer, \"Moneyball\". Through the years, he has designed and endorsed guitars, amplifiers and effects pedals for Ibanez, Marshall and Vox.

His daughter received a liver transplant in Fall 2016, and Angelo\u2019s latest release wrestles with the aches of adversity and ultimately celebrates the beauty of life and the hope he has for his daughter. A Matter of Time embraces the soul, classic r&b and piano-pop of some of Angelo\u2019s more prominent influences -- Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Elton John -- while fearlessly venturing into new sonic territory to compete with pop contemporaries like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. Alongside his finest songwriting to date, Angelo\u2019s voice resounds as an irrefutable force as he carries listeners to new places unfamiliar to the likes of modern pop music.\n\nA Matter of Time debuted at #12 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans.

The critically acclaimed five-piece was down to just four members, and while the obvious solution may have been to simply replace their departed comrade, the group instead made the bold choice to completely reimagine their lineup and their catalog, carrying forward as a quartet with an ambitious new approach to writing and recording. The result was a genuine sonic rebirth, a wild musical awakening that brought Parsonsfield closer together than ever before and yielded their most exhilarating and adventurous record yet: Happy Hour On The Floor.\n\u201cRecording this album marked our first time working in the studio as a four-piece, and it was really liberating,\u201d says lead vocalist Chris Freeman. \u201cOnce the lineup changed, we realized that there weren\u2019t any restrictions on what we could do. It came with this boundless sense of musical freedom where anything felt possible.\u201d\nProduced by Benjamin Lazar Davis (Joan As Police Woman, Okkervil River), Happy Hour On The Floor fuses Parsonsfield\u2019s rustic instrumentation and timeless sense of songcraft with dreamy synthesizers and vintage drum machines. The arrangements here are broad and spacious, often built off spare, hypnotizing loops that fuel the songs\u2019 mesmerizing drive, and the band\u2019s performances are deliberate and economical to match, substituting lean, careful construction in place of the strummed exuberance that defined much of their early work. The result is a record all about finding happiness in simplicity, a captivating collection more reminiscent of modern indie pop than old-school string bands that pushes the group far beyond the perceived boundaries of its sound even as it shines a spotlight on the heart and soul of what\u2019s always made them such a joyous revelation.\nHailed by Folk Alley as \"the most jubilant and danceable indie roots music this side of the Carolinas,\" Parsonsfield\u2014Freeman, mandolinist Antonio Alcorn, guitarist Max Shakun, and drummer Erik Hischmann\u2014first emerged in 2014 with Poor Old Shine, an ecstatic acoustic collection that prompted The New York Times to praise them as \"boisterously youthful yet deftly sentimental\u201d and No Depression to rave that they'll \"give you rich five-part harmonies one minute [and] sound like bluegrass on steroids the next.\" The band grew more experimental on their 2016 follow-up, Blooming Through The Black, and the collection earned them both glowing reviews and dates with everyone from Josh Ritter and The Jayhawks to Mandolin Orange and The New Pornographers. That same year, the group saw their music featured in the hit AMC series \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and teamed up with the prestigious FreshGrass Festival to compose a score for the 1922 silent classic Nanook of the North, which they performed live alongside the film at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charli XCX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8363770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Experimental, Other, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Carl Verheyen - Official ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9041717.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Reggae, Jazz Fusion, Rockabilly, Jazz, Bluegrass, Jam, Rock, Blues, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A member of the smash hit British rock group Supertramp since 1985, Carl has played to millions of enthusiastic fans in sold out arenas worldwide.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Thao & The Get Down Stay Down ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10383343.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After 15 years of recording and performing, Thao Nguyen, of San Francisco-based band Thao & The Get Down Stay Down, was exhausted.

Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music -

Country Artist JD Shelburne grew up on a tobacco farm in Taylorsville, KY, a tiny town southeast of the Ohio River near Louisville KY. At age 19, he found a guitar after the death of his grandmother and began learning to play and sing on his own. By his sophomore year of college, he had found a few gigs at some local bars in the Louisville/Lexington, KY area and developed a fan-base that eventually landed him on some of the biggest stages in the business, opening for some of the nation\u2019s hottest stars. Eventually, Shelburne was adding original songs into the set mix, in addition to producing songs of his own material.\n\nIn 2002, Kentucky fell in love at first sight with Shelburne, then college student/ small-town country boy with a wide smile, natural singing voice and a love of faith, family and his hometown of Taylorsville, KY. But that small-town image is merely a fond memory now that he has moved on to Nashville down the path to music stardom.\n\nNow find him soaking up the music scene, touring cities, building a fan-base and celebrating a decade of success playing venues all across the southeast trying to get his big break. Today he\u2019s among the most hard working and relevant country singers in the business. They say Nashville doesn\u2019t work that way anymore \u2013 that talented musicians with very few connections don\u2019t stand a chance. But Shelburne proved that Music City\u2019s engine still runs off of talent and persistent driven antics. Critics find him credible. Fans pack his shows. Venues strive to book him. There are very few new artists recording songs today about whom that can be said.\n\nDuring his whirlwind career explosion, he has performed with over 50 national acts ranging from stars such as Montgomery Gentry, Craig Morgan, Jamey Johnson, Kellie Pickler, Steve Wariner to Clay Walker and Johnny Lee, performed at some of the region\u2019s most famous venues such as the Historic Ryman Auditorium, Rupp Arena, Murphy Center, KFC Yum Center, Freedom Hall, Churchill Downs and Old Cardinal Stadium which recently drew the Kentucky State Fair\u2019s largest crowd of the concert series. Shelburne performed \u201cGod Bless America\u201d prior to the 2016 Quaker State 400 NASCAR race at Kentucky Speedway to over 100,000 attendees. He has also been featured in Country Weekly Magazine, Kentucky Alumni Magazine, Kentucky Monthly Magazine amongst many other national publications including the Huffington Post. His debut music video \u201cFarmboy\u201d gained him thousands of new fans by airing on the TNN Top Ten Countdown nationwide on Heartland TV network and ZUUS Country Network. In 2015, he made his Nationwide debut on GAC \u2013 Great American Country Network and also CMT.com in October with his second music video entitled \u201cHometown\u201d written about the demise of his smalltown. On October 21, 2015, Shelburne debuted as #1 trending artist on CMT.com edging out Taylor Swift, Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean! Shelburne has performed over 1000 concerts all over the southeast as well as over 300 festivals. Shelburne\u2019s outfit has been featured on display at the Kentucky Derby Museum at Historic Churchill Downs from his appearance at the 2015/2016 Kentucky Derby. In 2016, Shelburne was invited to perform in the Kentucky State Capitol for the State Senate as well as the House of Representatives where he performed his own rendition of \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home\u201d for both parties. JD was named an Honorable Kentucky Colonel and was also presented honor of \u201cAdmiral\u201d by the Commonwealth of Kentucky \u2013 Energy and Environment Cabinet recently. Also in 2016, the University of Kentucky\u2019s College of Communication and Information named JD Shelburne their 2016 Most Outstanding Alumnus!\n\nMost recently in 2017, Shelburne launched his world premiere official music video for \u201cBetter Man\u201d that was filmed in Midway/ Millville, KY. The video also made it\u2019s Network Television Debut on Great American Country (GAC) on June 23, 2017 and is currently in Nationwide rotation. At this past years Kentucky Derby, Shelburne was invited to cook with Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives host Guy Fieri at his restaurant alongside Guy, Travis Tritt and NFL Legend Jerry Rice! In September 2017, Shelburne made his NBC Network Television Debut performing the National Anthem at the NASCAR XS Myrtle Beach 300 at Kentucky Speedway!\n\nShelburne also has performed at several prestigious nationwide events: 2 NBA Basketball Games, Guaranteed Rate Field for the Chicago White Sox, Suntrust Park for the Atlanta Braves, The Kentucky Derby, Unbridled Eve Derby Gala, Barnstable Brown Derby Gala, events for Jim Beam Brands and Four Roses Bourbon, NCAA Division I College Football/Basketball Games, The National FFA Organization National Convention, Omni Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Hotel Brands, NASCAR Racing Events, Minor League Baseball Games, Dollar General NASCAR Racing Team Event, CMA Music Festival, the NCAA Women\u2019s Final Four, SEC Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament and more!

Beyond his creative work as a musician, Stewart is a renowned producer, author, director, photographer, filmmaker, and philanthropist. Stewart's music career spans three decades and more than 100 million album sales, highlighted by his collaboration with Annie Lennox in the groundbreaking pop-rock group Eurythmics (\u201cSweet Dreams [Are Made of This],\u201d \u201cWould I Lie to You?\u201d and dozens more). Behind the scenes he\u2019s produced albums and co-written songs for Bono, Bryan Ferry, Gwen Stefani, Tom Petty, Katy Perry, and Sinead O\u2019Connor, racking up numerous Producer, Songwriter, and Grammy Awards along the way. In 2010, Stewart co-wrote and co-produced Stevie Nicks\u2019 critically acclaimed solo album, In Your Dreams, marking the first time Nicks has ever collaborated on a solo effort. Stewart also took Joss Stone to Nashville, where they wrote and recorded her fifth studio album LP1. A lover of film and photography, Stewart shot full-length documentary feature films for both projects. The August 2011 release of Stewart\u2019s own record, The Blackbird Diaries (Razor & Tie/Surfdog Records/Weapons of Mass Entertainment) is his first solo project in over 13 years, and was recorded with some of Nashville\u2019s top players in a whirlwind five-day session at John and Martina McBride\u2019s Blackbird studio. The album, written by Stewart (with a co-write assist by Bob Dylan and guest appearances by Stevie Nicks, Martina McBride, Colbie Caillat, and the Secret Sisters) is a reflective and story-driven journey, with nods to his blues inspirations, the price of success, and relationships both lost and found. Additionally, Stewart filmed a companion movie for the album also entitled The Blackbird Diaries. Featuring performances of the songs and a look at the making of the record, the tongue-in-cheek film involves both a fortuneteller (played by Joss Stone) and a hypnotist (Diane Birch). For Stewart, the film is simply another creative outlet. \u201cI used to document everything, even back in the Eurythmics days,\u201d he says. \u201cI think filming and writing music are all part of the same process.\u201d Stewart\u2019s most recent collaboration is with Mick Jagger, Joss Stone, Damian Marley, and A.R. Rahman. The aptly titled heavyweight musical group, SuperHeavy, released their first record in September 2011 and have also been busy editing a behind-the-scenes look at the recording process. As a highly-regarded filmmaker, Stewart has scored films for directors Robert Altman, Paul Verhoven, and Ted Demme, and has written and produced the title songs for many hit movies throughout the years. Together with Mick Jagger, he wrote and produced the score for Alfie, starring Jude Law, which won the pair a Golden Globe for Best Original Song. Stewart and songwriter/producer Glen Ballard recently wrote the music for the musical adaptation of the 1990 Jerry Zucker film Ghost, which opened to rave reviews in London\u2019s West End July 2011, and will soon open on Broadway in 2012. As an entrepreneur, Stewart has worked with Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen to create The Hospital, a multimedia creative centre and members club in London. Along with Mick Jagger, Stewart is a founding partner in famos*, a new technology company offering monetization solutions for users with above average reach and influence. On his own, Stewart has established Weapons of Mass Entertainment, a \"media company for the new world\" (The LA Times), linking creative ideas to a host of projects in music, film, television, books, theatre, and new media. In 2010 Stewart released The Business Playground: Where Creativity and Commerce Collide (Financial Times / Pearson) a highly regarded business tome now available in eight languages. An innovative guide designed to show business people everywhere how to rediscover their creativity, the book contains a mix of inspiring creative conversations with Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, Tony Award winning director Matthew Warchus, and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. It also features case studies of groundbreaking companies like Google and NASA. Described by Bob Dylan as \"a fearless innovator,\" Stewart is an acclaimed public speaker.

Brooklyn, Austin, Los Angeles, Terlingua; they've called each home in just the last few years alone. If you really want to get to know this husband-and-wife duo, the better question to ask is where they're going. Perhaps more than any other band playing today, The Mastersons live on the road, perpetually in motion and always creating. Movement is their muse. On tour, in the unpredictable adventures and characters they cross, in the endless blur of skylines and rest stops and dressing rooms and hotels, that's where they find their greatest inspiration, where they hone their art, and where they crafted their brilliant new album, Transient Lullaby. \"When you travel like we do, if your antenna is up, there's always something going on around you,\" reflects guitarist/singer Chris Masterson. \"Ideas can be found everywhere. The hardest thing to find is time.\" For the last seven years, The Mastersons have kept up a supremely inexorable touring schedule, performing as both the openers for Steve Earle and as members of his band, The Dukes, in addition to playing their own relentless slate of headline shows and festivals. It was Earle, in fact, who pushed the duo to record their acclaimed debut, Birds Fly South, in the first place. \"Before we hit the road with him in 2010, Steve said, 'You'd better have a record ready because I'm going to feature you guys during the show,'\" remembers fiddler/tenor guitarist/singer Eleanor Whitmore. \"We didn't even have a band name at the time. We were going through all these ideas and Steve suggested, 'Why don\u2019t you just be The Mastersons, and that was that.\" Upon its release in 2012, Birds Fly South was a breakout critical hit on both sides of the pond, with Uncut awarding the album 9/10 stars and Esquire dubbing The Mastersons one of the \u201cBands You Need To Know Right Now\u201d. Two years later, they followed it up with Good Luck Charm, premiered by the NY Times and praised by Mother Jones for its \"big-hearted lyrics, tight song structures, and sweetly intertwined harmonies.\" Pop Matters ranked it \"among the top Americana releases of 2014,\" while American Songwriter called it \"a perfect soundtrack for a summer of warm nights and hot, lazy days,\" and the Austin Chronicle praised the band's \"spunky wit and rare measure of emotional maturity.\" The album earned The Mastersons slots on NPR's Mountain Stage and at festivals around the world, from San Francisco's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass to Australia's Byron Bay Bluesfest. With endless touring came new levels of comfort and confidence, and when it was time to record Transient Lullaby, The Mastersons knew they wanted to take a different approach than their first two releases. The band set up shop at Arlyn Studios in Austin, TX, where Chris shared production duties with longtime friend and collaborator George Reiff (Ray Wylie Hubbard, Band of Heathens). Together, they chased a sound that was subtler and more evocative, deeper and more contemplative. \"A lot of what we listen to when we have some rare time off is what we consider late night music,\" explains Chris, who previously played guitar with Son Volt and Jack Ingram among others. \"The last record was bright and jangly and we wanted this one to be vibey and dark. A lot of the stuff is very performance-based and not at all fussed with. We've grown so much more comfortable in our skin that we really weren't trying to sound like anyone other than ourselves this time around.\" \"We've had a lot of time and a lot of miles to refine our sound and our style of singing,\" adds Eleanor, whose resume includes work with Regina Spektor and Angus & Julia Stone. \"I think the depth of our songwriting has really grown, too. Part of the time we're writing on a tour bus with Steve Earle, and the bar for poetry is pretty high when you're within earshot of one of the greatest songwriters alive.\" Rich with Eleanor's stirring string arrangements and Chris's masterful guitar work, the songs on Transient Lullaby more than live up to the challenge. The album opens with \"Perfect,\" a loping duet written partially in Washington, DC, and partially in Newcastle, England, that paints a portrait of two broken lovers who still manage to find a strange optimism in this challenging world. Spare and affecting, the song puts the spotlight on the duo's intoxicating vocal harmonies and makes for an ideal entry point into an album full of characters facing down difficulty and darkness with all the grit and humility they can muster. \"Fight,\" written in a downtown Cleveland hotel, is a wry wink at the battlefield of marriage (\"I don't wanna fight with anyone else but you\"), while the fingerpicked \"Highway 1\" twists and turns on a California road trip through an emotional breakup. \"Life's not easy,\" reflects Chris. \"It's hard for everybody, and I don\u2019t see it getting any easier. All you can hope for yourself is grace when walking through it, and someone to prop you up when you need a little help.\" Though it's a deeply personal album, Transient Lullaby is not without its political moments. The Mastersons found themselves on tour in Lexington, KY, during the height of Kim Davis' obstinate stand against the Supreme Court's same sex marriage decision, and so they penned the infectious \"You Could Be Wrong\" in a dressing room before taking the stage with \"Love Wins\" draped across their guitars. \"This Isn't How It Was Supposed To Go\"\u2014a cosmic country duet written in Cologne, Germany\u2014has taken on new layers of political meaning in 2017, while \"Don't Tell Me To Smile\" is a tongue-in-cheek feminist anthem, and the gorgeous, slow-burning \"Fire Escape\"\u2014which came to life in a hockey rink locker room in Alberta, Canada\u2014suggests that the only solution to a polarized world of fear and distrust is to find strength and guidance in our loved ones. \"As we look at the world political landscape, global warming, a refugee crisis and the uncertain times we\u2019re all living in, rather than lose hope, we look to each other,\" Chris says. \"It\u2019s a little brighter than Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, but not much.\" Ultimately, the road is at the core of everything The Mastersons do. \"Happy When I'm Movin'\" reflects their constant need for forward momentum, both physically and emotionally, and the title track paints the pair as \"pilgrims of the interstate\" on an endless voyage. \"No I don\u2019t unpack my bag / Traveling from town to town,\" they sing in beautiful harmony. \"Set \u2019em up and knock \u2019em down / Where there\u2019s work and songs to sing / You\u2019ll know the place where I\u2019ll be found / If you don\u2019t want to be alone / Then come along.\" For The Mastersons, all that matters is where they're headed, and the songs they'll write when they get there.

Longtime friend Mike Bishop Smith (drums) completes the trio. With a unique blend of genres, thoughtful lyrics and superb musicianship, the band has garnered and vast and diverse following. Releases include 8 singles, 3 EPs and 1 full length album.\n\nIn mid-2019, The Powell Brothers changed shape. The band of four and five pieces became a fierce three piece power trio. As a power trio, the group\u2019s sound evolved from roots influenced Country/Americana to alternative influenced Country/Rock. On July 1, 2020, The Powell Brothers released their new single entitled \u201cHow It\u2019s Done.\u201d \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is emblematic of the band\u2019s new hard hitting Country/Rock sound. The track has major attitude. Hot out of the gate, the listener is hit with powerful electric guitar riffs backed by a driving drum beat and gritty bass tones.\n\nThe story of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is based on a conversation between a young aspiring artist and an old man at a bar. The old man reflects on his life as a hardworking, blue collar laborer and the young artist shares his dream about \u201cmaking it\u201d in the music business. The old man tells the young artist that life is tough and the road is bumpy and long, but if he is willing to work hard enough he can accomplish anything. The chorus of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d sings:\n\nStoke the fire and keep on diggin\u2019\nmake the most of what you\u2019re given\nit may seem cold and it may seem tough\neven steel will bend when you heat it up\n\nYou\u2019re on the road to better days\nif you can outlast the sun and outlast the rain\nand a lot of hard lessons made\nLet me tell you son, soon you\u2019re gonna show us how it\u2019s done\n\nThis track will be on The Powell Brothers\u2019 next EP set to release in the Fall of 2020.

The brothers have been featured at major festivals and events like the Oregon Jamboree (Sweet Home, Oregon), Sweet Pea Festival (Bozeman, MT), Oyster Ridge Music Festival (Kemmerer, WY), Memorial Day Music Festival (Dallas, TX), Ziegenbock Music Festival (Corpus Christi, TX) and Merchants & Music Festival (Fort Thomas, KY) to name a few.\n\nThe Powell Brothers\u2019 music really comes to life in their high energy live show.

I\u2019m Ruth\u2026welcome to my little world! I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream. (Dreams are good. I hope you have lots of them:)\nI grew up in rural western NY on a vineyard that\u2019s been in my family for over a hundred years. My grandma was the farmer\u2019s daughter and my grandpa worked on the grapes with her dad. That\u2019s how they met\u2026 Cute huh?\nMusic has been a part of my life since forever. I started playing piano and fiddle when I was three. I sang my first solo at church that year \u2013 and I also wrote my first song titled \u201cMr. Bluebird\u201d \u2013 my mom swears it was the same every time I sang it! Three was clearly a big year for me! But it was middle school when I fell in love with country music. This was 90s country at it\u2019s best \u2013 artists like Garth Brooks, Jo Dee Messina and Faith Hill were killing it on country radio and I couldn\u2019t get enough. I loved the stories they were telling through their songs. In high school it all came together when I started writing and playing the guitar. I was hooked.\nI get asked all the time how a girl from NY could possibly sing country music. Well I have a couple things to say about that: A) They play George Straight in the Wal-Mart where I\u2019m from too and B) My high school mascot was the Fredonia Hillbillies\u2026doesn\u2019t get much more country than that, does it?\nAfter graduating high school I attended Berklee College of Music where I majored in songwriting and made some lifelong friends. I fell in love with Boston (go Red Sox!) but I struggled to find my artistic voice during those years. So with hope in my heart I decided to make the move to Music City.\nWhen I moved to Nashville I started to write with everyone I could. I wrote all the time, sometimes several songs in one day and I was blessed by the support and feedback of so many talented co-writers. Within months, I finally felt like I was writing songs that were me, and through these songs, I found my voice.\nDuring this time I formed the duo Wild Honey, with another local songwriter, Victoria Gibson and we were featured on Season 1 of CMT\u2019s Can You Duet. Being on Can You Duet was the wildest experience. One week I\u2019m waiting tables and the next I\u2019m moving into the Opryland Hotel for a month of filming. Suddenly there were cameras and lights shoved in our faces almost 24 hours a day. The stakes were raised in a big way. The best way I can put it is this\u2026 where I\u2019m from, a tiny little town in NY, I never dared to dream that big\u2026 It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to sing for stadiums of millions of people\u2026 It\u2019s just that I never believed that it could happen to a small town girl like me. But all of a sudden, there I was competing on national television for a major label record deal. Can You Duet gave me the push I needed to realize that dreams do come true\u2026even for normal little people like me.\nAfter Can You Duet, it was on. I worked as hard as I could, writing everyday and back to waiting tables, sometimes till 4 in the morning to make ends meet. All that changed when I signed with Curb Records and Curb Publishing in the summer of 2011. That was a quite the summer! Within 3 months I got married, bought a house and signed a record deal! Whew\u2026 let me tell you, that was a much needed honeymoon:)\nI still live in Nashville, TN, now with my sweet husband and our two tiny dogs (Emmylou and Hazel). And I am so blessed to get to do music everyday. Sometimes when I\u2019m driving down to Music Row in the morning, (that\u2019s where the magic happens here in Nashvegas) I\u2019ll stop for a second and think \u201cI get to hang out my friends today and write a song\u201d???!!!! \u201cLike for my job\u201d???!!! Crazy!\nIt is a crazy life, but it\u2019s mine and I love it! I\u2019m currently recording my first album for Curb Records and it\u2019s SO exciting!!!\nThis record is the result of years of writing songs about the hurts and heartbreaks, joys and blessings, wild rides and sunny days that we all experience. This album represents everything I\u2019ve gone through while chasing down and exploring this wonderful adventure called music. In these songs, I tried to express the emotion we all go through while searching through the storm to find the light, love and home. I hope you love it!:)\nSo that\u2019s my story\u2026 That\u2019s me\u2026 I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream.

Cole has infused wit and poetry in seven albums of original work over a twenty-plus-year-career. In performance, Cole gives of herself to such a degree that she elicits tears and gasps and goose bumps from audiences. In her lyrics, she writes of inner life, of redemption, a woman\u2019s perspective; of social justice.\n\nAs the first woman in history to solely produce and receive the Best Producer Grammy nomination for her work, \u201cThis Fire\u201d, Cole broke boundaries with a searcher\u2019s spirit.

She attended Berklee College of Music as a jazz singer, graduated in 1990, fervently writing and recording her original work. In 1993, Peter Gabriel heard her then-unreleased debut album \u201cHarbinger\u201d and invited Cole to join his \u201cSecret World Live\u201d tour. While touring internationally with Gabriel, Cole\u2019s \u201cHarbinger\u201d debuted in 1994 to critical acclaim. She toured non-stop and released her second album, 1997\u2019s \u201cThis Fire\u201d for which she won the Grammy for Best New Artist along with seven nominations. Cole led the pack at Lilith Fair\u2019s opening years, and in 1999, followed her muse to release \u201cAmen\u201d, a genre-crossing, social-spiritual album to diverse audiences.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus to raise her daughter Sky, who battled childhood asthma, Cole returned to her \u201csecond, more authentic career\u201d releasing five more albums, \u201cCourage\u201d (2007), \u201cIthaca\u201d (2010), \u201cRaven\u201d (2013), \u201c7\u201d (2015), and \u201cThis Bright Red Feeling\u201d (2016), touring consistently over the last decade.\n\nCole walks her path with her fans, writing out her life, sharing her connection at concerts and over social media.

Perez, the band\u2019s drummer, once called their powerhouse mix of rock, Tex-Mex, country, folk, R&B, blues and traditional Spanish and Mexican music \u201cthe soundtrack of the barrio.\u201d Three decades, two more Grammys, a worldwide smash single (\u201cLa Bamba\u201d) and thousands of rollicking performances across the globe later, Los Lobos is surviving quite well -- and still jamming with the same raw intensity as they had when they began in that garage in 1973. The band chronicles a key moment of their expansive journey on Disconnected In New York City, a dynamic live album that marks the band\u2019s 40th anniversary and launches their new association with 429 Records.\n\nRecorded over two nights in December 2012 at The City Winery in NYC, the engaging 12-song set celebrates Los Lobos\u2019 great legacy as a freewheeling and unpredictable live band, which most recently includes touring in Europe with Neil Young and Crazy Horse in June 2013. Disconnected in New York City features fresh interpretations of songs from throughout their three decade recording career, including their first ever live recording of \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d their worldwide pop crossover hit from the 1987 film which reached #1 on the U.S. and UK singles chart and whose video won a 1988 MTV Music Video Award. The collection covers the band\u2019s 25 year studio discography, from \u201cGotta Let You Know\u201d (a bouncy zydeco rocker driven by Hidalgo\u2019s accordion from How Will The Wolf Survive?) through \u201cTin Can Trust,\u201d a bluesy rock ballad that was the title cut from their last studio release in 2010.\n\nBy design, Disconnected in New York City has songs that have been longtime staples of Los Lobos\u2019 tours mixed with other gems that had somehow fallen by the wayside over the years. The mix includes the mid-tempo shuffling rocker title track from The Neighborhood (1990); the easy flowing and whimsical (thanks to Berlin\u2019s jazzy sax solo) \u201cOh Yeah\u201d (from This Time, 1999); the spirited, traditional flavored, Rosas penned Spanish language \u201cChuco\u2019s Cumbia\u201d (from The Town and the City, 2006); the graceful and spiritual \u201cTears of God\u201d (from By The Light of the Moon, 1987); \u201cLa Venganza de Los Pelados,\u201d a fiery burst of Latin rock fusion with mariachi textures (from The Ride, 2004); the soulful, simmering blues of \u201cLittle Things\u201d (from The Town and The City, 2006); the Latin blues funk classic \u201cSet Me Free Rosa Lee\u201d (from By The Light of the Moon); and two mid tempo funk pop/rock tunes from 2002\u2019s Good Morning Aztlan, \u201cMaria Christina\u201d and \u201cMalaque.\u201d\n\nAs per the literal meaning of its title, Disconnected In New York City sets itself apart from Los Lobos\u2019 other acclaimed live recordings (most notably, 2005\u2019s Live At the Fillmore) by stripping down the instrumentation for a mostly acoustic affair. Lozano, who drives the grooves with his bass and also plays the deep-bodied Mexican 6-string acoustic bass called the guitarron, says, \u201cIt\u2019s funny because when the venue hired us, they specifically requested that we do something acoustic to fit its smaller dinner house vibe. The idea popped into our heads to ask them if we could record it and they were cool with that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well known for our electric, high energy performances but we\u2019ve done acoustic stuff for certain smaller auditorium tours,\u201d he says. \u201cPlaying these songs acoustically makes them feel more intimate. We notice that when you play softer and quieter, the audience tends to pay attention to everything we\u2019re doing. When you play rock, they\u2019re thinking more about rhythm than melodies and lyrics, but playing them this way allows for more subtle elements of the songs to stand out.\u201d\n\nPerez laughs when he calls the Los Lobos Unplugged experience \u201cfolk music for the hearing impaired - it\u2019s still loud because the acoustic instruments are amplified! The idea of making a record like this came from never having the opportunity to work some of our favorite songs from over the years into our usual sets. Because most tours are done in support of new albums, the fresh material we play means that some favorite older tunes fall away over time. When we thought about making another live album and what would make it different, the logical concept was to revisit songs we haven\u2019t played in a while but had been requested by a lot of fans. We had already documented our rock show with Fillmore, so we felt kind of liberated to take another approach with this one.\n\n\u201cThere are two challenges releasing a live album, though,\u201d Perez continues. \u201cOne is choosing certain songs over other ones. It\u2019s like having kids. We love Tommy as much as Johnny but one day Johnny gets to go the park today and Johnny stays home. In spite of this, we do cover a lot of ground. The biggest problem is the way people sometimes perceive live albums, like they\u2019re an afterthought put out to fill some kind of gap. Bands love doing them but fans don\u2019t always pay attention. But historically, it can be a license for great creativity. Jimi Hendrix did Band of Gypsies to fulfill his last recording commitment, but it was one of the most incredible recordings he ever made. Because Disconnected in New York City marks a key anniversary and the start of us working with a new label, we put a lot of thought into the project, from its design and structure and how we performed the songs.\u201d\n\nSteve Berlin is Los Lobos\u2019 saxophonist, flutist and harmonica player who met the band while still with seminal L.A. rockers The Blasters. He joined the group after performing on and co-producing (with T-Bone Burnett) their breakthrough 1983 EP \u2026And A Time To Dance. Though he wasn\u2019t jamming with the others way back in the \u201cKrypton days\u201d (as Perez calls it) in the barrio garage, Berlin felt it was important to find a special way to mark his cohorts\u2019 40th year--just as they had done on their 30th by inviting special guests (Dave Alvin, Bobby Womack, Elvis Costello, Mavis Staples) to be part of their 2004 date The Ride.\n\n\u201cTrying to figure out a way to acknowledge 40 years as a band is harder than you might think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got to play with all of our heroes on our 30th so what was something we had not done? So, like Louie said, we thought the best thing was to bring back songs we rarely if ever play and put them into a fresh context. We wanted to create something of value for our fans that would reflect the mutual appreciation we share with them \u2013 starting, of course, with \u2018La Bamba,\u2019 which we had never documented live before. I think it was important also that once we knew the set lists for the shows that we would eventually choose the final tracking from, we didn\u2019t over-think the arrangements. We only rehearsed these shows for a single day. The coolest part of how Disconnected worked out is that we hadn\u2019t been doing some of these songs long enough to worry about how to pull them off. And because we performed them acoustically, we couldn\u2019t just blast everyone with power and skate through them. We had to be present and make the choices that occurred to us in each moment.\u201d\n\nAround the time of their last big anniversary Rolling Stone magazine summed up that distinctive, diverse and spontaneous Los Lobos aesthetic perfectly: \u201cThis is what happens when five guys create a magical sound, then stick together for 30 years to see how far it can take them.\u201d Most fans know that the group came together from three separate units. Hidalgo, the band\u2019s lead vocalist/guitarist (whose arsenal includes accordion, percussion, bass, keyboards, melodic, drums, violin and banjo) met Perez at Garfield High in East LA and started a garage band. Rosas, who plays guitar and mandolin, had his own group, and Lozano launched a power trio. \u201cBut we all hung out because we were friends and making music was just the natural progression of things,\u201d says Perez. \u201cLike if you hang around a barbershop long enough, you\u2019re going to get a haircut.\u201d\n\nLooking back at the historical and cultural sweep of the band, Lozano sees the release of Disconnected In New York City as Los Lobos coming full circle. \u201cA lot of people forget that though we were rock musicians when we got out of high school, the band started off as an acoustic outfit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to play Mexican folk music because those were our roots and there was this whole Chicano awareness thing happening back in the early 70s. We started to pay attention to our traditions and culture, and focused on those styles of music for years. We studied music from every region of Mexico, learned how to play all these authentic instruments. So that\u2019s what we did for ten years until we decided to play rock again by bringing in drum and electric bass.\n\n\u201cWe were playing this restaurant gig for two years, and some small local clubs, playing the same songs, when people in the crowd started shouting out, \u2018Do you know any Beatles or Grateful Dead tunes?\u2019\u201d Lozano adds. \u201cSoon we got fired from the restaurant and headed back to the garage to write our first original songs that were rock with some accordion on them: \u2018Let\u2019s Say Goodnight\u2019 and \u2018How Much Can I Do?\u2019 We made a little tape and gave it to the guys in The Blasters, which included Steve Berlin, when we went to see them live on Sunset Strip. They loved our tunes and invited us to open their show at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go, which was the first time Los Lobos performed on the other side of the Los Angeles River. We played some originals and old favorites by Hendrix, Cream, The Yardbirds and Beatles \u2013 all the stuff we loved as kids. The icing on the cake is that the audience loved it, too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "David Hidalgo to perform for Justice Aid Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HCM_DCpPcJh_CIF45FToQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "David Hidalgo ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Blues, Folk, Latin, Americana", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "David Hidalgo (born October 6, 1954, Los Angeles, California) is a singer-songwriter, best known for his work with the band Los Lobos.

The New Orleans-based septet scored a game-changing hit with \u201cWish I Knew You,\u201d a wistful song from their third album, Men Amongst Mountains. Guided by dynamic percussion and punchy horns, the single features a contagious hook and feel-good chorus that has resonated with fans across all different genres. Though the album was released in July of 2015 (debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard Alternative Albums chart), the band's break out single \"Wish I Knew You\" has a rare and undeniable staying power. The song steadily picked up steam in 2016 spending over 40 weeks on the Billboard Adult Alternative Chart where it peaked at #1 and maintained for multiple weeks. By 2017, the song crossed to Alternative radio rising quickly to #1 and breaking the Billboard chart record for most single-week spins ever at Alternative radio. \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d then peaked inside the Top 15 at Adult Pop Radio and ultimately spent 9 weeks in the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe meaning behind \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d is up for debate and the band could not be happier about it. \u201cSome of the best songs are the ones that don\u2019t have just one meaning,\u201d says vocalist David Shaw. \u201cWe love hearing all the different interpretations our fans have. Of course the song talks about the idea of wishing for more time together earlier in life, but we\u2019ve heard all different takes on who that someone is, what the message means, and even what point of view the lyrics are coming from. We hope that people make our songs their own and \u2018Wish I Knew You\u2019 is like a canvas that our fans have filled with their imaginations and personal experiences. That is what we want our music to do.\u201d\n\nThe success of \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d has opened many doors for the band, earning them praise from the likes of Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, Buzzfeed, Flaunt, Paste and Interview, nabbing them a nod as a \u2018YouTube Artist on the Rise,\u2019 and landing them performances on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (the host called the song his \u201csummer jam\u201d), Conan, The Today Show, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where Shaw shared a rare and impromptu mid-performance dance with the star. \"That was a surreal moment for us,\" he marvels. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I\u2019d be dancing with Ellen DeGeneres!\u201d\n\nComprised of acclaimed musicians David Shaw [lead vocals/guitar], Zack Feinberg [guitar], Andrew Campanelli [drums], George Gekas [bass], Ed Williams [pedal steel guitar], Rob Ingraham [saxophone], Michael Girardot [keyboard & trumpet], The Revivalists are recognized as an extraordinary live band. And while \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d has had a seismic effect on their career, The Revivalists\u2019 relentless touring over the past several years has played a major part in getting them to this point.\n\nThe band has sold-out headlining tours in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and performed sets at such marquee festivals as Bonnaroo, Governor\u2019s Ball, Outside Lands, and Austin City Limits. This past year they were invited to perform on the main stage at New Orleans\u2019 Jazz Fest (after six years playing the second stage) for 40,000 people, attracted 5,000 fans to their show at Central Park\u2019s SummerStage in New York City, and visited cities like Toronto for the first time playing to packed houses.\n\n\u201cWe did it by building a live audience and our fans bringing their friends to see us,\u201d says Campanelli. \u201cSo when we got a song on the radio, it was tens of thousands of people saying, \u2018Our band is on the radio!\u2019 That has allowed it to expand because our fans are excited about it and are telling their friends. When we play the single, the new people who come to see us are not just holding up their phones for a video then leaving. They\u2019re singing every word because they\u2019ve become fans as well.\u201d \u201cPlaying live is the life blood of this band,\u201d agrees Shaw. \u201cIt\u2019s how we connect. There\u2019s no substitute for getting out there in someone\u2019s face, letting them see the veins popping out in your neck, or sweat dripping off your knuckles as you strum a guitar.\u201d\n\nThe four years that The Revivalists spent touring in support of their second album, City of Sound, informed many of the songs on Men Amongst Mountains, which was recorded live in just 21 days with producer Ben Ellman (Galactic, Trombone Shorty). Album opener \u201cKeep Going\u201d serves as an anthem for these road warriors. \u201cSometimes it was all of us packed into one hotel room,\u201d Shaw recalls of that time. \u201cIf we were lucky, we got two or three hotel rooms to split, so there was no personal space. You're eating fast food because you don't have any money. Those were trying times and all of that hardship went into the lyrics.\u201d The album\u2019s title was inspired during the band\u2019s stopover in Colorado where they were awestruck by the majestic grace of the surrounding mountains. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a metaphor for being small in a vast, expansive universe and knowing you are essentially insignificant, but standing amongst the mountains, you are among the greats, so it kind of elevates you,\u201d says Feinberg. \u201cIt's an uplifting title.\u201d\n\nAll members of The Revivalists share songwriting duties, with Shaw writing the lion\u2019s share of the lyrics. \u201cI draw inspiration from what is happening in my life and what I\u2019m being influenced by at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen life is tumultuous, I write more. When I\u2019m in the light, a person like me is almost seeking the dark. But when I\u2019m in the dark, I\u2019m like \u2018Get me out of this hole.\u2019 Songwriting is an escape; a way to externalize a lot of internal feelings.\u201d\n\nBy making the personal universal, The Revivalists have managed to attract a wide range of listeners who are also no doubt drawn to their eclectic rock sound, which has a bit of swing and a gritty Southern roots vibe. It\u2019s inspired perhaps not sonically \u2014 they are not a heritage brass band \u2014 but spiritually by their adopted hometown. \u201cThe mood we create in a room makes people feel like they\u2019re in New Orleans,\u201d says Campanelli of the band\u2019s free-wheeling show, which is filled with audience interaction and improvisation. \u201cWherever we go, we bring that vibe, spirit, energy, and looseness to the room that wasn\u2019t there the night before. We played a show in St. Louis and people lost their minds dancing. Afterward they told us, \u2018Wow, people don't dance in St. Louis.\u2019 That\u2019s what we bring. We make a Tuesday night in your town feel like New Orleans on a Saturday night.\u201d\n\nThe seeds of The Revivalists were planted in 2007 when Feinberg, out riding his bike, came across Shaw sitting on his front porch belting an original song called \u201cPurple Heart\u201d (which wound up on The Revivalists debut album Vital Signs). Shaw had moved to New Orleans two weeks prior for its rich musical history and because he had heard the city was in need of construction workers to help rebuild the city after Hurricane Katrina. (He had just graduated from Ohio State with a degree in construction management.) Feinberg had also moved to New Orleans for the music scene and to study psychology at Tulane University. He had only been in the dorms for an hour when everyone was forced to evacuate due to the impending hurricane. That day in August 2007, Feinberg and Shaw struck up a conversation and instantly began to jam and collaborate, establishing an immediate musical connection and friendship. Within weeks they had invited Campanelli, whom Feinberg had met through workshops at New Orleans music venue Tipitina\u2019s, to join them. Rounding out the band\u2019s line-up is Ingraham, Gekas, and Girardot, whom Feinberg and Campanelli knew from Tulane and Loyola respectively, as well as Williams, whom they all knew from the local music scene.\n\nThe Revivalists played clubs like Checkpoint Charlie\u2019s in New Orleans and Bamboo Willie\u2019s in Pensacola, which Shaw equates to The Beatles\u2019 \u201cHamburg Years,\u201d because of the epically long shows. \u201cWe played four to five hours a night and didn\u2019t have that much material, so we had to stretch and find ways to engage the crowd,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made it our mission to grab every single person\u2019s attention, which is what happened. By the end of the first set, everyone who had been standing at the bar would be standing at the front of the stage. That\u2019s when I started to realize we had something special.\u201d\n\nThey called themselves The Revivalists, which felt fitting given what the city was going through two years after the devastation of Katrina. \u201cNew Orleans was finally starting to rebound, and seeing it get back on its feet at the same time that this band, which respects older styles of music, was getting together, it just felt right as a name,\u201d says Feinberg. \u201cIt\u2019s about the excitement of this great American city, this great musical city, coming back to life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "David Shaw and Zach Feinberg to preform for Justice Aid Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HCM_DCpPcJh_CIF45FToQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charlie Worsham ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10382852.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer.

Armed with Bach\u2019s Cello Suites, Leyla moved to New Orleans to play cello on the streets of the French Quarter.\n\n\nIt is the move to New Orleans that signaled a journey of musical and cultural discovery for Leyla. \u201cNew Orleans always felt like home to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe more I learned about the history of Louisiana, its ties to Haiti and French speaking culture, the more sense of belonging I felt and continue to feel.\u201d Most recently, Leyla has fallen in love with the late Louisiana Creole fiddlers Canray Fontenot and B\u00e9b\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re and has explored their fiddling styles on the cello.\n\n\nLeyla\u2019s move to New Orleans also signaled a new stage in her career. It was while playing on the street that she caught the attention of Tim Duffy, the founder and director of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. He invited Leyla to join the Music Maker Relief Foundation family and introduced her to the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a renowned African-American string band. After appearing on the band\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated album Leaving Eden and touring extensively with the group, she now focuses on her solo career.\n\n\nVari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes, Leyla\u2019s debut album, is set for a February 2014 release. The album, which has been years in the making for Leyla, was given a push after a successful Kickstarter campaign in which she surpassed her $5,000 goal by four times to ultimately raise over $20,000. Vari-Colored Songs consists of compositions she has written to Langston Hughes poetry, Haitian folk songs and original pieces. The album features musicians including Rhiannon Giddens and Hubby Jenkins of the Carolina Chocolate Drops as well as New Orleans\u2019 own Don Vappie on tenor banjo and Luke Winslow King on guitar.", "otherInfo": "Justice Aid Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HCM_DCpPcJh_CIF45FToQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "May Erlewine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9334351.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Traditional Folk, Old-time Country, Roots, Swing, Americana, Jazz, Bluegrass, Soul", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "May Erlewine has split her heart wide open and hasn\u2019t hidden any of the contents from view.\n\nOne of the Midwest\u2019s most prolific and passionate songwriters, May\u2019s gift for writing empathetic and engaging songs that feel at once fresh and soulfully familiar has earned her a broad, devoted fan base well beyond her deep-set Michigan roots. May\u2019s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.\n\nRaised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nErlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country, swing, soul, and even rock n\u2019 roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.\n\nWith a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine\u2019s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC\u2019s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys, and others.\n\nErlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in our world. May's body of work has become an anthem and an example of why we need to listen to women, and why we need to hear their stories.\n\nMay\u2019s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times. When she starts to sing, there\u2019s no way around it: welcome in, everyone. The door is wide open.", "otherInfo": "Weekly check in with songwriter May Erlewine Songs and sentiments for lifting our hearts and holding space for all the feels.

Simple while funky. Classic but contemporary. Straightforward in the way it breaks down complex ideas and genres. And, at the end of the day, undeniably human. That said, it isn't quite a rebirth for the Nashville-born artist, who after stints living in New York and Los Angeles has returned back home to Music City. She's long had that lithe and smoky voice and an intensely expressive mastery over the piano. For those paying attention, Kandace's second album finds her unleashing what was there all along, all at once, for the first time.\n\nFor Kandace it boils down to a question that connects past to present: \u201cWhat would Nina Simone do if she had the technology of today? You could never put Nina in a box\u2014she would do a blues followed a classical piece, a jazz standard and then a Beatles cover. This LP took a lot of inspiration from that\u2014it\u2019s a mix of everything that I am.\u201d Indigo offers a fairly plausible answer to that impossible query: songs that swirl classical composition with quiet-storm cool, jazz poise with hip-hop swing, tropical warmth with soulful depth, and earthen groove with airy psych. With all but two of the tracks here produced by the mighty drummer-producer Karriem Riggins\u2014the living bridge spanning Oscar Peterson and Diana Krall to Erykah Badu and J Dilla\u2014Indigo creates a vibe as familiar as it is previously unheard.\n\nTake \u201cIndigo Part 1,\u201d and \u201cIndigo Part 2,\u201d a pair of interludes that give the album its title, where allusions\u2014Rachmaninoff, Portishead, Sade\u2014emerge and melt into the liquid soundscape. It feels like magic. And then there's \u201cDon\u2019t Need The Real Thing\u201d with a breezy dancehall beat that'd sound at home in today's Top 40, except far more musical and almost hypnotic in its combination of plaintive bass and busy percussion. Kandace\u2019s versatility is underscored when one juxtaposes \u201cBreakdown,\u201d a pop ballad stunner that Kandace co-wrote with the track\u2019s producer Jamie Hartman (Rag'n'Bone Man), and \u201cUnsophisticated,\u201d a sultry jazz ballad that features Roy Hargrove's trumpet playfully intertwined with Kandace's voice and keys.\n\nAsk our heroine how Indigo became the name of the entire project and she replies, with an air of mystery, \u201cThe album is an exotic flower, its own kind.\u201d The more you listen, the more that makes sense. In fact, she could be describing herself.\n\nKandace grew up the bi-racial daughter of a soul singer in a country-western town. Her dad Scat Springs had his own band but also sang backup for an incredible array of musicians: Brian McKnight, Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Michael McDonald, Donna Summer. He did voices on Nashville radio too, while Kandace's mother had a full-time gig raising three talented daughters at home. Kandace's first passions were drawing and cars. \u201cMy dad gave me a Matchbox muscle car and my mom gave me a Barbie,\u201d she says. \u201cI drew a mustache on Barbie and never played with her again. I still have the Matchbox.\u201d\n\nShe collects, rebuilds, and resells cars to this day, but her plans to one day study automotive design were put on hold at age 10 when Scat brought home an upright piano (side note: Kandace still plans to pursue her dream of going to automotive school one day). She couldn't leave the keys alone, and soon mom started taking her to lessons, while dad let her tag along to sessions and led his own three-girl choir in the living room. \u201cHe'd make us do hymns but we hated it,\" Kandace laughs. \"We'd be singing and crying at the same time.\u201d\n\nHer father instilled in Kandace a love of the greats\u2014Nina of course, but also Ella Fitzgerald, Eva Cassidy, Luther Vandross\u2014and eventually they grew closer than ever through music. He helped her record a demo at 15 and got it into the hands of the production team Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken, who have written hits for the likes of Shakira, Christina Aguilera, and Kelly Clarkson, and are best known for discovering Rihanna as a teen and signing her to their production company SRP. They offered Kandace a deal but it was too much, too soon. \u201cMy dad said, \u2018If you sign with these guys, I'll never get the chance to make an album with you,\u2019\u201d says Kandace. \u201cI'm so glad I waited.\u201d She and Scat made that album when she was 17 and though it was never released, a piece of it appears on Indigo. Scat suffered a stroke in early 2017 that rendered him unable to sing, so she pulled one of his original vocals from their record and set it to new music. Powered by her signature Rhodes electric piano, \u201cSimple Things\u201d is the beating heart of this LP.\n\nWhen the time came, Evan and Carl got Kandace into Blue Note Records to audition for president Don Was. She performed a Bonnie Raitt song that he'd originally produced, and he was sold. Her 2014 self-titled EP found her teaming with cutting-edge hitmakers like Pop & Oak and won her late-night TV appearances on Letterman, Kimmel and Fallon, plus sets at festivals like Bonnaroo and Afropunk. Her 2016 full-length Soul Eyes took a different tack. Grown, stripped, and refined, it was essentially a live album\u2014solid, unfussy bedrock for future experimentation. All that history, and the fact that she featured on a couple Ghostface Killah cuts, made Karriem exactly the right person to work with Kandace to catalyze the best parts of various interests into something new.\n\n\u201cI love crossing genres and the direction on Indigo was to marry all the different things to tell her story,\u201d says Karriem, who tracked his drums at various studios while on the road with Krall, and chopped and reassembled his and Kandace's recordings into what you hear. \u201cIt sounds organic because everything was built around the songwriting. She says so much on the piano, and her voice is amazing\u2014it's the focal point of the whole sound. I kept it simple, added a little punch.\u201d\n\nKandace also co-wrote several songs with her longtime collaborators Evan and Carl including \u201cPiece of Me\u201d which finds Kandace channeling Sade to stunning effect. The three also wrote \u201cFix Me\u201d together, taking inspiration from Chopin\u2019s Prelude No. 4, and the groovy lament \u201cLove Sucks\u201d which was produced by Evan and Carl along with the UK\u2019s Jimmy Hogarth (Amy Winehouse, Corinne Bailey Rae).\n\nSome of Indigo's greatest songs are its most unadorned: \u201cBlack Orchid\u201d highlights the acoustic strum of guitarist-songwriter Jesse Harris (who struck Grammy gold with Kandace's early hero Norah Jones by penning her breakout hit \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why\u201d); a cover of The Stylistics' \u201cPeople Make the World Go Round\u201d drifts languidly over Karriem\u2019s drum programming; the remake of Gabriel Garz\u00f3n-Montano's \u201cSix Eight\u201d is molasses slow and crystalline pretty; and the Roberta Flack-popularized torch song \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\u201d (a crowd favorite at Kandace\u2019s live shows) radiates light from the white space between notes. That one was special for Kandace. \u201cPrince picked it for me to play for Purple Rain's 30th anniversary at Paisley Park in 2014,\u201d she says. \u201cHis band played behind me. He stood off to the right. It's something I'll never forget.\u201d That was Kandace's first big break. The legendary artist saw her on YouTube before she'd released a single note and invited her out. It's testament, again, to the power and potential that's been in Kandace this whole time.\n\nIf you listen closely, you'll hear a nod to Prince in the lyrics of \u201cFix Me,\u201d but the best tribute she could pay to him, Ms. Simone, and the humble legacy of the man who introduced her to music, her father, is by, as Karriem words it, \u201ccreating something that adds to the art form.\u201d With Indigo, an album that couldn't have been made by anyone but her, Kandace Springs does exactly that.\n\nFor more information contact Cem Kurosman at Blue Note Records\n(p) 212.786.8634 (e) cem.kurosman@umusic.com", "otherInfo": "Justice Aid Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HCM_DCpPcJh_CIF45FToQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Doobie Decibel System ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7057985.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Folk, Rock, Jam Rock, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "11:20 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Doobie Decibel System (DDS) Trio features Jason Crosby, Roger McNamee, and Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What! The Good, the Mad, and the Ugly\u201d, an edited compilation of the band\u2019s fan club magazine spanning 10 years from 1994 to 2004.\n\nAnd still the \u2018Madly In Anger With The World\u2019 tour continued, selling out venues right through to it\u2019s final date in San Jose, California on November 29, 2004.\n\nThey did publicly state that the majority of 2005 would be spent re-charging those creative and mental batteries, and true to their word it was a quiet year, except for two little hometown gigs with the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in November. We all knew an entire year would not pass without at least a sighting of the guys!\n\nWith batteries re-charged after the two shows with the Stones, the guys hit the studio in early 2006 to start writing a new album and were excited to announce that they would be working with a new producer, Rick Rubin. The spring and summer found them escaping from the studio once again with shows in South Africa (their first ever visit to the continent!), Europe, Japan and Korea. \u201cThe New Song\u201d made its debut in Berlin, Germany on June 6 to give us all a little taste of things to come in 2007 with the remainder of the year scheduled for more writing and jamming.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Islander ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10311423.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Punk, Alternative Metal, Experimental Punk, Metal, Trap", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "It has been quite a journey for ISLANDER, who, in just over a year, have gone from obscurity to a band in constant radio rotation.

At age 12 she was appearing on Knoxville TV, and at 13, she was recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. When she graduated from high school in 1964 she moved to Nashville, taking many traditional elements of folklore and popular music from East Tennessee with her.\n\nParton's initial success came as a songwriter, with her songs being covered by Kitty Wells, Hank Williams, Jr., Skeeter Davis, and a number of others. She signed with Monument Records in late 1965, where she was initially pitched as a bubblegum pop singer, earning only one national chart single, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,\" which did not crack the Billboard Top 100. Additional pop singles also failed to chart.\n\nThe label agreed to have Parton sing country music after her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\" as recorded by Bill Phillips (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony) went to No. 6 on the country charts in 1966. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but didn't write), reached No. 24 country 1967, followed later the same year with \"Something Fishy,\" which went to No. 17. The two songs anchored her first full-length album, Hello I'm Dolly, that same year.\n\nIn 1967, Parton was asked to join the weekly syndicated country music TV program hosted by Porter Wagoner, replacing Norma Jean. She also signed with RCA Records, Wagoner's label, during this period, where she would remain for the next two decades. Wagoner and Parton immediately began a hugely successful career as a vocal duet in addition to their solo work and their first single together, a cover of Tom Paxton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind,\" reached the top ten on the U.S. country charts in late 1967, and was the first of over a dozen duet singles to chart for them during the next several years.\n\nParton is a hugely successful songwriter, having begun by writing country songs with strong elements of folk music in them based upon her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings. Her songs \"Coat of Many Colors\" and \"Jolene\" have become classics in the field, as have a number of others. As a composer, she is also regarded as one of country music's most gifted storytellers, with many of her narrative songs based on persons and events from her childhood.\n\nIn 1987, Parton left her longtime label, RCA, and signed with Columbia Records, where her recording career continued to prosper, but by the mid 1990s, Parton, along with many other performers of her generation, found that her new music was not welcome on country radio playlists. She recorded a series of critically acclaimed bluegrass albums, beginning with \"The Grass is Blue\" (1999) and \"Little Sparrow\" (2001), both of which won Grammy Awards. Her 2002 album \"Halos and Horns\" included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin classic Stairway to Heaven. In 2005, Parton released Those Were The Days, her interpretation of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s through early 1970s. The CD featured such classics as John Lennon's \"Imagine,\" Cat Stevens' \"Where Do The Children Play,\" Tommy James' \"Crimson & Clover,\" and the folk classic \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\", as well as the title track.\n\nIn 2007, Dolly paved new musical ground by forming her own record label, Dolly Records. The label's first release - Backwoods Barbie - debuted at #2 on the Billboard country albums charts and marks Parton's first mainstream country album in 17 years. Parton is touring North America and Europe throughout 2008 in support of her latest release.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sara Evans ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10276459.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Multi-platinum entertainer SARA EVANS is at the top of her game.

A multi-dimensional artist with a rowdy style unbound to any one genre, Manic Focus transcends sound waves by fusing soulful blues with heavy-hitting bass, creating a resonating tone that\u2019s entirely his own. Over the last 6 years, JmaC has released five full-length albums, each one a new evolution in sound and approach. He has also completed a slew of official remixes for artists such as GRiZ, The Floozies, Lettuce, Minnesota and Pretty Lights, and released several works with Pretty Lights Music veterans Break Science.\n\nOn the road, JmaC has been steadily building his live performance to include additional musicians and elements of production. Jacob Barinholtz is now a mainstay on the drums, and other musical co-conspirators join the two on select dates around the country. He\u2019s also been known to incorporate surprise guests such as Big Gigantic\u2019s Dominic Lalli, GRiZ, The Floozies\u2019 Matt Hill, and Russ Liquid, to name a few. Occasionally, fans are treated to the rare live fusion of Break Science and Manic Focus, taking the stage as Manic Science. Recent live highlights include performances at The Gorge Amphitheater in WA and Red Rocks Amphitheater in CO, both dates as support for Pretty Lights. Summer 2017 has seen performances from Manic Focus at Summer Camp Music Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Camp Bisco, and Summer Set Music Festival, to name a few.\n\nIn the studio, JmaC continues to push himself to new musical limits by incorporating original, sample-free recordings of many up-and-coming musical allies. This is especially apparent in the material from his most recent album, Minds Rising. Released in April 2017, Minds Rising is an infectious encapsulation of Manic Focus' roots in funk, soul, new-era hip hop, and electronic music. The album is an artful curation of the burgeoning Chicago music landscape and beyond, featuring appearances from cutting-edge hip hop artists, vocalists, producers, and musicians from across the country. Collaborators include Jennifer Hartswick of Trey Anastasio Band, Adam Deitch of Lettuce/Break Science, Russ Liquid, ProbCause, Late Night Radio, and more.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What! The Good, the Mad, and the Ugly\u201d, an edited compilation of the band\u2019s fan club magazine spanning 10 years from 1994 to 2004.\n\nAnd still the \u2018Madly In Anger With The World\u2019 tour continued, selling out venues right through to it\u2019s final date in San Jose, California on November 29, 2004.\n\nThey did publicly state that the majority of 2005 would be spent re-charging those creative and mental batteries, and true to their word it was a quiet year, except for two little hometown gigs with the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in November. We all knew an entire year would not pass without at least a sighting of the guys!\n\nWith batteries re-charged after the two shows with the Stones, the guys hit the studio in early 2006 to start writing a new album and were excited to announce that they would be working with a new producer, Rick Rubin. The spring and summer found them escaping from the studio once again with shows in South Africa (their first ever visit to the continent!), Europe, Japan and Korea. \u201cThe New Song\u201d made its debut in Berlin, Germany on June 6 to give us all a little taste of things to come in 2007 with the remainder of the year scheduled for more writing and jamming.", "otherInfo": "#MetallicaMondays"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mark Wills ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10316169.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Reader\u2019s Digest version of Mark Wills\u2019 story makes it clear he\u2019s an award-winning singer\u2019s singer.

LOOKING FOR AMERICA delivers music with a no-holds-barred edge softened with a trademarked tenor vocal that will capture the attention of music lovers from every genre from first cut to last.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA clearly raises the flag to demonstrate the responsibility he feels to Americans alike, and specifically our military, with the title cut and \u201cCrazy Being Home.\u201d\n\nWills has made more seven trips to entertain our troops; he is familiar with the places they\u2019ve been.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What! The Good, the Mad, and the Ugly\u201d, an edited compilation of the band\u2019s fan club magazine spanning 10 years from 1994 to 2004.\n\nAnd still the \u2018Madly In Anger With The World\u2019 tour continued, selling out venues right through to it\u2019s final date in San Jose, California on November 29, 2004.\n\nThey did publicly state that the majority of 2005 would be spent re-charging those creative and mental batteries, and true to their word it was a quiet year, except for two little hometown gigs with the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in November. We all knew an entire year would not pass without at least a sighting of the guys!\n\nWith batteries re-charged after the two shows with the Stones, the guys hit the studio in early 2006 to start writing a new album and were excited to announce that they would be working with a new producer, Rick Rubin. The spring and summer found them escaping from the studio once again with shows in South Africa (their first ever visit to the continent!), Europe, Japan and Korea. \u201cThe New Song\u201d made its debut in Berlin, Germany on June 6 to give us all a little taste of things to come in 2007 with the remainder of the year scheduled for more writing and jamming.", "otherInfo": "#MetallicaMondays"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Keller Williams ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8567342.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Keller Williams Solo, Keller Williams with The Travelin' McCourys, Keller with More Than A Little, Keller The Keels, Grateful Grass, The KW KWahtro, WMD's, KIDS and more at www.KellerWilliams.net", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Music lover and performer", "otherInfo": "80 minutes of live Keller from his cellar!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Paul Keith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10308785.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A veteran of the Memphis music scene, singer, songwriter, and guitarist John Paul Keith has four critically acclaimed solo albums, including his latest, \"Heart Shaped Shadow\".

His matchless phrasing, passionate and meaningful delivery and right-on-the money vocals make each and every song he performs come alive. Like a picture perfect painting, Wills\u2019 music is a vocal work of art that walks right off the canvas and into the hearts of country music lovers alike.\n\nBringing the Wills\u2019 dimension to some of the greatest songs ever written, he\u2019s not necessarily become known for being trendy, hip or even on the cutting edge, but rather and simply as a damn good singer!\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a good storyteller to make a son g meaningful. Whether romantic or \u2018reality,\u2019 my focus is on the music delivery to make it my own for the people who listen\u2014so that they can make it their own.\u201d\n\nAnd the people listen...\n\nHis list of accolades is his testament. Mark Wills is a multi-platinum selling country music star with eight top 10 hits to his name including \u201c19 Something,\u201d \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Laugh At Me;\u201d all of which received nominations for Single, Song and Video of the Year by the Country Music Association. Wills won the Academy of Country\nMusic's award for Top New Male Vocalist in 1998. In 2002, his single \u201c19 Something\u201d spent six consecutive weeks at No. 1, was Billboard\u2019s top country hit of the year and was the second most-played song of the decade in 2009.\n\n\u2026and that\u2019s just a chapter in Mark Wills\u2019 life story.\n\nSince garnering his Top New Male Vocalist recognition in 1998, Wills has become a staple in country music, like salt and pepper on a table; the chapters may have changed, but the story continues. The father of two daughters, a husband and the head of household, Mark\u2019s role in life and music are one in the same.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019ve seen all sides of me! I\u2019ve become more aware of who I am not only as an artist, but as a father, a husband and a friend\u2026and as a dad, I want to put out music my children can listen to; all in all, I take more ownership in it.\u201d\n\nHis ownership is made evident in his newest collection of recordings on the CD entitled LOOKING FOR AMERICA; an assortment of tunes Mark describes as different, yet the same.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA is a project with no \u2018sacrifices.\u2019 With titles like \u201cSmoking Gun,\u201d \u201cWhere Did I Lose You,\u201d \u201cA Whole World\u201d and \u201cRocking The Country,\u201d the tracks are not just about a rhyme and a hook, they\u2019re a menagerie of people-stories--a musical exhibition of heart-heavy, romantic, comedic all-American existence with apple pie flavor. Describing the hue of the music, Wills colors his music \u201cdark blue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of many personalities with a lot that I want to say. There\u2019s a fun, down-home side of me, and then there\u2019s an emotional, serious side. I think LOOKING FOR AMERICA, topically, is a human interest story of love, tragedy and life\u2019s unexpected.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has ever seen him in concert, or has met with him personally, knows that inside this humble, good ol' boy, country singer dwells a soul who just wants to speak to and for all with his music. LOOKING FOR AMERICA delivers music with a no-holds-barred edge softened with a trademarked tenor vocal that will capture the attention of music lovers from every genre from first cut to last.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA clearly raises the flag to demonstrate the responsibility he feels to Americans alike, and specifically our military, with the title cut and \u201cCrazy Being Home.\u201d\n\nWills has made more seven trips to entertain our troops; he is familiar with the places they\u2019ve been. His trips have taken him to Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. He has also performed at several events for the Champions for Champions Organization, the USO\nand a variety of Fallen Soldier Charities here in the U.S. Having become personally acquainted with the faces of our brothers and sisters of the military, LOOKING FOR AMERICA is dedicated in part to these brave individuals.\n\n\"First of all, it's a privilege to provide a little joy and entertainment for these people. The first time I went, it was a life-changing experience. The freedom that we have is not something that I take for granted--they're literally giving their lives for us. By playing a show for them or releasing a song that shares their emotional story, it\u2019s my way, however minimal, to say \u2018Thank You.\u2019\u201d\n\nSupporting our troops is just one of a number of philanthropic endeavors Mark Wills dedicates his time and effort to. He has aligned with USA Cares to launch a national awareness campaign surrounding the severity of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Since 2007, Mark has been the\nspokesperson for the Children\u2019s Miracle Network and its annual celebrations.\n\nAs an active representative, he accompanies miracle children to Walt Disney World and then to Washington each year as part of a national awareness campaign; the children enjoy lunch with Congress and a trip to the White House to meet with the President.\n\nTurning the page from bringing all-American music to life to his own brush with death, Wills was caught by surprise by an unexpected, eye-opening crisis. In October 2010, Mark experienced what felt like a \u201cpoke\u201d in his side that was followed by flu-like symptoms. A visit to the doctor took him straight to the emergency room. \u201cThe nurse said, \u2018we have to admit you immediately,\u2019 I said, \u2018I need to go home to let the girls know,\u2019 her response to me was, \u2018You don\u2019t have the time.\u201d Mark suffered from an intestinal infection that could have taken his life, but he pulled through with a nine-inch long scar to remind him of its value.\n\n\u201cIt was a dire circumstance and it gave me a whole new perspective in all aspects of my life.\u201d\n\nA man whose appetite for life surpasses what most people can only dream of \u2013 a dedicated parent, philanthropist, outdoorsman, jokester \u2013 but, more than anything, else Mark Wills is an artist and, behind the artist, is an even better singer.\n\n\u201cWhen the story comes to \u2018The End,\u2019 I just want to be remembered as a great singer - who sang great songs \u2013 and used his talents to not only speak to people but was the voice for many.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jess Jocoy Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9996865.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Alt-country, Americana", "Time": "1:15 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Nashville-based singer/songwriter of Americana, roots-based music.

Animal Style Records released the album in the US and Uncle M had the honours over in Germany. The record has received much attention and plaudits from the likes of Kerrang!, Rock Sound, Upset, Noisey, DIY, The Line of Best Fit & Punktastic. Muncie Girls were also nominated for \u2018Best British Newcomer\u2019 at the Kerrang! Awards 2016. Recent singles have received plays on BBC Radio 1, Kerrang! Radio, Amazing Radio & Scuzz TV. Born in punk shows and dive bars to three driven teenagers in 2012, Muncie Girls embodies the classic punk rock story in a modern context. Fuelled by discontent and anxiety, they eloquently address issues of modern living as a self-aware young adult. The result is an ambitious and poignant rebellion against social norms that touches on everything from politics to interpersonal relationships. Musically, the album is a dynamic and emotional exploration of punk and indie rock. The album\u2019s bouncy catchiness is sure to be a hit with fans of Hop Along, Lemuria, Latterman, and RVIVR, but one of the defining characteristics of Muncie Girls is their ability to explore outside their immediate influences. Ultimately, what sets Muncie Girls apart is vocalist & bassist Lande Hekt\u2019s unique perspective and its impact on her understated lyricism. Hekt\u2019s dry, unembellished writing style is, in many ways, reminiscent of classic American literature \u2013 a trait exceptionally unusual for a punk rock band from Exeter.

Reuniting in Austin in 2008, they enlisted their pals Andy Bauer (guitar) and Graham Low (bass) and christened the act A Giant Dog. AGD is raucous ear candy culled from the hook-driven melodies of Slade, the glammy swagger of Marc Bolan, the morbid fantasy of Killer-era Alice Cooper, and the unpredictable wit of Sparks. Sabrina and Andrew\u2019s lyrics, equal parts brutally honest, clever, and debased, have a knack for taking their idiosyncratic depravities and making them feel universal. These songs are by, for, and about the losers, freaks, and outcasts. The lonely. The terminally horny. Boozehounds and party animals. No band better speaks to the hearts of slackers, burnouts, rockers, sluts, and creeps everywhere than A Giant Dog. AGD have built their reputation blowing the goddamned doors off every venue in Austin. Live, they are loud, heavy, electrifying. Sabrina struts around the stage like Iggy Pop channeling Tina Turner. Andrew hurls himself from the summit of the speaker stack. Graham\u2019s headbanging clobbers anything close to him. The audience rages, asses shake, and everyone leaves drenched in beer and bodily fluids. Over the years, they\u2019ve clocked in their time on the road, leaving destruction in their wake. They\u2019ve shared members with other bands in the Austin rock \u2019n\u2019 roll community including Sweet Spirit, OBN IIIs, Bobby Jealousy, and others. In 2012, AGD impressed fellow Austinite and Spoon frontman Britt Daniel enough that he took them under his wing to start demolishing concert halls across the USA as the support act for his band. In Daniel\u2019s own words, \u201cAndrew and Sabrina are currently writing circles around just about anyone else in rock and roll. Their live show is insane, which is probably why I\u2019ve seen more of their shows than any other band\u2019s over the past few years.\u201d Pile, AGD\u2019s third LP and first for Merge Records, shows a band whose years of road-dogging have honed them into unstoppable rock machines. Their second time working with producer Mike McCarthy (Spoon, White Denim, Trail of Dead) reveals Sabrina\u2019s impressive pipes, Andrew\u2019s sweet licks, and a pummeling rhythm section\u2014everything is tighter, more focused, crisper. The album deals with divorce, getting older, dying, frustration, and futility, ultimately transcending those earthly headaches through the power of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.", "otherInfo": "Watch A Giant Dog (https://youtu.be/IBaOjTGREeU) in their 2015 Galaxy Barn performance for Pickathon #AConcertADay!

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

The band was formed as a vision of Todd Michael, a singer/songwriter from Michigan, to be a regional powerhouse and to spread their passion and joy of music to all who attend their shows.\n\nTodd Michael \u2013 Lead Vocals - the golden voice and Country front man out of the Great Lakes Bay Region of Michigan, has been nominated for Country Male Vocalist of the Year by Review Magazine in 2016 and again in 2017. Todd found a love for music very early on and has been singing since he can remember. \"My first solo performance was at 6 years old in church for Father's Day. I sang \"Love With Out End, Amen\" by George Strait. Country music is in my blood and nothing more I love than to be on stage and entertaining.\" Todd continued to grow his passion for singing at Reese High School and as he attended Saginaw Valley State University. In 2008, Todd won the Soaring Eagle Casino Idol Contest. Since then, Todd has performed with many great musicians as lead vocalist for Michigan cover bands Detroit Dixie, Kickin\u2019 Dust, and Taylor Tucky. During his musical career so far, Todd has provided direct support for National Country Artists \u2013 Brothers Osborne, Trent Harmon, Jason Michael Carroll, Parmalee, Thompson Square, Lauren Duski, Casi Joy, Eli Young Band, Jerrod Niemann, Brett Young, Ashley McBryde, David Lee Murphy, Josh Gracin, Sara Evans, Wynonna, Carly Pearce, Chase Rice, Walker Hayes, Scotty McCreery, Jon Langston, and many more.\n\nTHE TODD MICHAEL BAND:\nCharlie Coen - Lead Guitarist/Vocals - Charlie cut his teeth in a power trio playing the Detroit Rock scene. Then he hit the road playing in venues from Pontiac Silver Dome to The Rock'n'Roll Hall Of Fame, Monticello in New York, Puckett\u2019s Nashville, Florida to Las Vegas and everywhere in between. Charlie was on the bill with some of the biggest names in country music; Little Big Town, Thompson Square, Big & Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Dwight Yoakum, and the list goes on.

He is an accomplished guitar player, drummer, vocalist, songwriter, producer and engineer. He also has the convenience of a recording studio in his home and takes advantage of it whenever he can. He has showcased his talents on many recordings over the years with some of them earning airplay on local radio stations. Rob notes, \u201cI grew up on KISS, Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, and all the 70\u2019s rock and roll. If you have told me 15 years ago that I would be playing country music, I would have laughed. This new generation of country is a lot more rock than it was 10 years ago. There are a lot of great guitar players in the country music scene!\u201d Rob\u2019s guitar playing has that edge that the new generation of country demands, plus he still has that country \u201ctwang\u201d in his back pocket when he needs it. He is a great showman with great stage presence which makes him a great asset to the Todd Michael Band.\n\nBruce Shew - Bass/Vocals - Bruce is a 4th generation musician and has over 20 years of playing bass professionally. Bruce not only plays the bass extremely well, but he also has great vocal ability to sing both lead and harmnoy.

Always rockin' on the \"White Tiger\" carpet, Justin brings his years of experience in the studio and on the road from his days as a member of Tweed and Dixie before joining the Todd Michael Band!\n\nPete Johnson - Acoustic Guitar/Bass/Vocals - Pete Johnson brings an exciting edge to the Todd Michael band by creating intriguing Acoustic Guitar parts, instinctive harmonies and delivering high energy performances. He plays bass, guitar, piano, and even the ukulele. Pete brings professionalism to all areas including assisting with some of the arrangements and production.\nBorn into a family of talented musicians, it is no surprise how quickly his passion for music and precision developed. He began studying piano at age 5. With growing interest this was followed by singing and playing in his church\u2019s praise band, he has also been a member of such groups as Kari Holmes, Five Rows Back and The Stand Strength Team. He started his own group, BIC, where he wrote and recorded music, played bass and sang lead.

Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rory Block ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7263745.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When Aurora \u201cRory\u201d Block was fourteen she was part of the Greenwich Village folk scene.

I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Allaire ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9806442.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Bluegrass, Rock, Folk Rock, Folk", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "John Allaire is an experienced, award-winning singer/songwriter with a gift for weaving captivating musical stories. Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "John Allaire plays music from his albums with a feature album each show.

Now at work on the follow-up to Lift Your Spirit, the L.A.-born rapper/singer/songwriter has expanded his emotional terrain to capture an even more personal element of the human experience.\n\n\u201cMy goal for this next album is to continue with the aspirational songs I\u2019ve been writing\nfor a while now, but add a dimension that\u2019s more focused on love and relationships,\u201d\nsays Blacc. \u201cMy own relationship with my family and my wife is so important to me, and I want these songs to give people the opportunity to celebrate the love in their life.\u201d\n\nOn his latest single \u201cBrooklyn in the Summer,\u201d Blacc offers an early glimpse into the\nnew direction he\u2019s taken in his thoughtfully crafted songwriting. Built on a brightly\nmelodic sound that echoes his fresh-yet- timeless sensibilities, the storytelling-driven\nbreakup ballad channels the sweet ache of nostalgia as Blacc delivers a deeply\npassionate vocal performance.\n\n\u201cSummertime in Brooklyn is electric with all kinds of energy\u2014it\u2019s this magical time that\u2019s full of music, kids running around the park, everybody hanging out in the street, the sun shining on your face,\u201d says Blacc of the song\u2019s inspiration. \u201cSo many good memories are made during those times, and there\u2019s something extra-special about all that when you think of how winter can be so brutal.\u201d\n\nSet to appear on his forthcoming album, \u201cBrooklyn in the Summer\u201d follows a pair of\nrecently released songs that show the remarkable scope of Blacc\u2019s artistry. Those\nsongs include \u201cMy Story,\u201d an acoustic-guitar- laced, Americana-tinged meditation on\nself-reliance that he penned for the MacGillivray Freeman/Brand USA film America\u2019s\nMusical Journey. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film finds Blacc tracing the\nfootsteps of Louis Armstrong from New Orleans to Chicago and beyond, crossing paths with icons like Dr. John, Jon Batiste, and Gloria and Emilio Estefan along the way.\n\n\u201cWorking on America\u2019s Musical Journey really reinforced the idea that there are no rules in music,\u201d says Blacc. \u201cIt reminded me to experiment and take risks, because those experiments can become new genres that help push our culture forward.\u201d\n\nIn a more direct manner, Blacc\u2019s experience in meeting with other artists for America\u2019s\nMusical Journey ended up altering his approach to the writing of \u201cMy Story.\u201d \u201cThere was a lyric I\u2019d initially written as the beginning of the second verse to that song: \u201cGray hairs are the ribbons/For a game of life well played,\u2019\u201d Blacc recalls. \u201cBut then when I met with Gloria Estefan, she told me how that lyric really resonated with her, so I moved it to the start of the song. That was a great moment, because the art of songwriting is the most meaningful part of this whole business for me.\u201d\n\nReleased in March, the fast-paced and fiery \u201cMake Way\u201d embodies a more urgent\nenergy, merging gospel-inspired harmonies with the commanding vocal presence\nBlacc\u2019s shown since his 2010 breakthrough hit \u201cI Need a Dollar.\u201d \u201cThat song comes from the idea that the world gets out of the way for someone who knows where they\u2019re\ngoing,\u201d explains Blacc. \u201cIt\u2019s a declaration that nothing can stop you from achieving your goals. As long as know what your direction is, the path will always be clear.\u201d\n\nAs Blacc points out, \u201cMake Way\u201d also explores a theme that\u2019s long been central to his\nsongwriting: the struggle of the underdog, and the glory that comes from triumphing\nagainst all odds. \u201cThe underdog narrative is definitely part of my upbringing,\u201d says\nBlacc. \u201cMy parents are from Panama; they\u2019re immigrants who came to this country with nothing. Even though my dad was fully educated, none of his degrees were recognized in the U.S., so he had to start all over. The idea of building completely from scratch and making something of yourself has always meant a lot to me.\u201d\n\nRaised on salsa, merengue, and cumbia, Blacc fell in love with hip-hop as a kid and\nstarted writing rap songs when he was nine. With his lyrics drawing influence from\nsocially conscious artists like KRS-One, he put out his first hip-hop mixtape at age 17.\nLater developing a fierce admiration for such soul musicians as Donny Hathaway and\nMarvin Gaye, he also discovered an affinity for folk-rock singer/songwriters during his\ncollege years. \u201cOne of the most important factors in my transition from hip-hop to being a singer was listening to people like Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Kris Kristofferson, and Cat Stevens,\u201d Blacc says. \u201cTheir songs are full of emotion that\u2019s expressed in strong lyrics, and that had a big impact on me.\u201d\n\nAfter inking a deal with indie label Stones Throw, Blacc released his solo debut Shine\nThrough in 2006 and sophomore album Good Things in 2010. Boosted by the breakout success of \u201cI Need a Dollar\u201d (which was selected as the theme song to HBO\u2019s How To Make it In America), Good Things reached gold status in countries around the world and paved the way for his signing to XIX Recordings/Interscope Records in 2012.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion. Now, 2016 finds him writing, touring, and releasing new material, with his sights set on expanding well beyond the two cities of his origin.

A self-described \u2018military brat\u2019, Welling\u2019s struggle to feel rooted in any one place carved a unharmonious path of heartbreak, doubt, and insecurity that defined her 20s and early 30s\u2026 a journey that lead to her soul-defining rebirth as an international touring artist with a place to call home in Nashville, TN.\n\nHer bold, sultry voice, reminiscent of Sheryl Crow\u2019s grit, Natalie Maines\u2019 twang, and Stevie Nicks\u2019 heart, is upstaged only by the genuine love and connection this natural performer has with her fans both on and off stage. But embracing confidence has not always been easy for this singer-songwriter, who speaks candidly about her battle to be good to herself, and to quiet the inner voice nagging her to be \u201cperfect\u201d. Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends. Some of them I talk to everyday, and they give me music ideas! They keep me going,\u201d she says, reflecting on the creator-founded platform.\n\nMelodies rich in folksy, Americana roots, paired with empowering, honest lyrics are stunningly showcased in Welling\u2019s forthcoming, full length album High Heels and Heavy Things. Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft. Meyers, FL). She\u2019ll be a featured artist at the \u201cSongwriters Island Showcase\u201d in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in 2020, and will be opening once again for Delta Rae and David Cook (Summer Tour 2020). In the interim she\u2019s logged countless hours on the road, performing at venues and house concerts across the US, as well as an international tour through Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things will be available on iTunes and Spotify worldwide in Summer of 2020.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

The stakes are different.\"\n\nThose stakes are what lie at the heart of David Wax Museum's fourth and boldest studio album to date, \"Guesthouse.\" It's the sound of a band reconciling the accountability of marriage and parenthood with the uncertainty and challenges of life on the road; of coming to terms with the limitations of the \"folk\" tag that launched their career and pushing past it into uncharted musical territory; of reimagining their entire approach in the studio to capture the magic and the bliss of their live show. In typical David Wax Museum fashion, the songs on \"Guesthouse\" are simplistic and sophisticated, elegant and plainspoken all at once. Rather than succumbing to the weight of the newfound responsibilities that landed on their doorstep, the band has leaned into the challenges to capture a brilliant portrait of the messy beauty of it all.\n\nThe roots of David Wax Museum stretch back nearly a decade, and all the way from New England to Mexico. As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as \"pure, irresistible joy.\" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding \"like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent\") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music \"global crossover at its best\"). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, and more.\n\nIt was on the road over these past few years as the band and audiences grew, though, that Wax could feel their exuberant live show evolving beyond its formative roots.\n\n\"I felt empowered to start the band because of my time in Mexico studying folk music,\" Wax explains. \"In Boston, the term 'Americana' or 'folk' was just this catchall to describe what everyone was doing. It was helpful to use that to talk about our music at first, but we've found that our hearts feel most shaken, and the band fires on all cylinders, when we're putting on a rock show. What we've tried to retain about our folk origins is the warm sound of people playing acoustic instruments together in a room. But, by embracing more of an indie rock approach, we've colored this record with synthesizers, layers of percussion, and adventurous sonic processing. The mental shift of it helped us feel like we could do anything we wanted. There were no rules that we had to follow in terms of what was 'authentic.'\"\n\nPart of the inspiration for the shift was the presence of guitarist and producer Josh Kaufman, who sat in with the band on tour and added new sounds and textures that the they'd never experimented with before. When it came time to record \"Guesthouse,\" the band knew he had to helm it in the studio.\n\n\"The songs entered this Technicolor, 3D world with Josh,\" explains Wax. \"Aside from his contributions to the arrangements, he really wanted us all to be in a room playing the music together live so that the groove would be central. We brought in two other drummers, and there was a real focus on having as much percussion happening at the same time as possible. We gravitate towards that naturally because of the Mexican influences, all of the syncopations and 6/8 dance rhythms and the energy that that gives us, but we really embraced it this time around.\"\n\nThat emphasis on groove sucks you in from the opening seconds of the kickoff track, \"Every Time Katie,\" a whispered come-on that roils and pulses like an anxious heartbeat and features gorgeous call and response vocals from David and Suz. It's followed by \"Dark Night Of The Heart,\" which pushes the sonic envelope further than any previous David Wax Museum track, blending chamber strings, psychedelic vocal filters, explosive drums, and swirling synthesizers.\n\nWritten partially in Mexico and partially in western Massachusetts, the lyrics on \"Guesthouse\" find Wax writing with more direct, personal honesty than ever before.\n\n\"I had felt really reluctant to talk about personal stuff in the past,\" says Wax. \"I was writing personally, but there were lots of things I was obfuscating or filtering through a character to protect myself from putting too much out there. But it got to a point where it was taking a lot more energy than it was worth to maintain that privacy. When we had our daughter, Calliope, it felt like this sudden release because talking and singing about our lives was becoming more and more integral to what we were doing as artists and who we were as people.\"\n\nThe title track, which draws on several traditional Mexican songs for musical inspiration, is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the life of a traveling musician hunting for a free place to crash, while \"Lose Touch With The World\" faces down the reality of living a life far removed from that of your friends and family, and \"Young Man\" is an earnest musing on growing older.\n\n\"It's about being a parent and coming to terms with what your ambition is,\" explains Wax. \"What part of that is essential to who you are, and what part can you let go of? We have to check in with ourselves and ask what we're doing and why we're doing it more often now because we're not just us putting ourselves through the mental and physical sacrifices of touring anymore,\" he continues. \"Now Calliope is going through it with us, and Suz's dad and my cousin Jordan are going through it with us on the road. And because we're constantly checking and making sure we're doing this for the right reasons, that we feel honest in our hearts about it, I think that's brought new life to what we're doing and a new energy and a new level of commitment.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment brought beautifully to life on \"Everything Changes,\" as Wax and Slezak sing, \"Everything changes / when two becomes three.\" The song was written in response to all of the good-natured warnings about what having a child would mean for the couple, the freedom and sleep and sanity they might lose out on. Instead, they choose to focus on everything they've gained: a beautiful daughter, a stronger bond with their families and fans than ever before, and without a doubt, the most exciting album of their career. For David Wax Museum, the stakes may be higher, but that just means the rewards are even bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Odyssey Road ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6629905.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "R&b, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul, Rock, Blues, Pop", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "James 'Bubba' Sanderford Vocals\nBorn in Memphis TN He played in High School Band from 7th grade through 12th, various instruments such as: Clarinet, Saxophone, Baritone, Oboe, Percussion, Bass and Guitar.

A self-described \u2018military brat\u2019, Welling\u2019s struggle to feel rooted in any one place carved a unharmonious path of heartbreak, doubt, and insecurity that defined her 20s and early 30s\u2026 a journey that lead to her soul-defining rebirth as an international touring artist with a place to call home in Nashville, TN.\n\nHer bold, sultry voice, reminiscent of Sheryl Crow\u2019s grit, Natalie Maines\u2019 twang, and Stevie Nicks\u2019 heart, is upstaged only by the genuine love and connection this natural performer has with her fans both on and off stage. But embracing confidence has not always been easy for this singer-songwriter, who speaks candidly about her battle to be good to herself, and to quiet the inner voice nagging her to be \u201cperfect\u201d. Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends. Some of them I talk to everyday, and they give me music ideas! They keep me going,\u201d she says, reflecting on the creator-founded platform.\n\nMelodies rich in folksy, Americana roots, paired with empowering, honest lyrics are stunningly showcased in Welling\u2019s forthcoming, full length album High Heels and Heavy Things. Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft. Meyers, FL). She\u2019ll be a featured artist at the \u201cSongwriters Island Showcase\u201d in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in 2020, and will be opening once again for Delta Rae and David Cook (Summer Tour 2020). In the interim she\u2019s logged countless hours on the road, performing at venues and house concerts across the US, as well as an international tour through Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things will be available on iTunes and Spotify worldwide in Summer of 2020.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

The stakes are different.\"\n\nThose stakes are what lie at the heart of David Wax Museum's fourth and boldest studio album to date, \"Guesthouse.\" It's the sound of a band reconciling the accountability of marriage and parenthood with the uncertainty and challenges of life on the road; of coming to terms with the limitations of the \"folk\" tag that launched their career and pushing past it into uncharted musical territory; of reimagining their entire approach in the studio to capture the magic and the bliss of their live show. In typical David Wax Museum fashion, the songs on \"Guesthouse\" are simplistic and sophisticated, elegant and plainspoken all at once. Rather than succumbing to the weight of the newfound responsibilities that landed on their doorstep, the band has leaned into the challenges to capture a brilliant portrait of the messy beauty of it all.\n\nThe roots of David Wax Museum stretch back nearly a decade, and all the way from New England to Mexico. As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as \"pure, irresistible joy.\" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding \"like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent\") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music \"global crossover at its best\"). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, and more.\n\nIt was on the road over these past few years as the band and audiences grew, though, that Wax could feel their exuberant live show evolving beyond its formative roots.\n\n\"I felt empowered to start the band because of my time in Mexico studying folk music,\" Wax explains. \"In Boston, the term 'Americana' or 'folk' was just this catchall to describe what everyone was doing. It was helpful to use that to talk about our music at first, but we've found that our hearts feel most shaken, and the band fires on all cylinders, when we're putting on a rock show. What we've tried to retain about our folk origins is the warm sound of people playing acoustic instruments together in a room. But, by embracing more of an indie rock approach, we've colored this record with synthesizers, layers of percussion, and adventurous sonic processing. The mental shift of it helped us feel like we could do anything we wanted. There were no rules that we had to follow in terms of what was 'authentic.'\"\n\nPart of the inspiration for the shift was the presence of guitarist and producer Josh Kaufman, who sat in with the band on tour and added new sounds and textures that the they'd never experimented with before. When it came time to record \"Guesthouse,\" the band knew he had to helm it in the studio.\n\n\"The songs entered this Technicolor, 3D world with Josh,\" explains Wax. \"Aside from his contributions to the arrangements, he really wanted us all to be in a room playing the music together live so that the groove would be central. We brought in two other drummers, and there was a real focus on having as much percussion happening at the same time as possible. We gravitate towards that naturally because of the Mexican influences, all of the syncopations and 6/8 dance rhythms and the energy that that gives us, but we really embraced it this time around.\"\n\nThat emphasis on groove sucks you in from the opening seconds of the kickoff track, \"Every Time Katie,\" a whispered come-on that roils and pulses like an anxious heartbeat and features gorgeous call and response vocals from David and Suz. It's followed by \"Dark Night Of The Heart,\" which pushes the sonic envelope further than any previous David Wax Museum track, blending chamber strings, psychedelic vocal filters, explosive drums, and swirling synthesizers.\n\nWritten partially in Mexico and partially in western Massachusetts, the lyrics on \"Guesthouse\" find Wax writing with more direct, personal honesty than ever before.\n\n\"I had felt really reluctant to talk about personal stuff in the past,\" says Wax. \"I was writing personally, but there were lots of things I was obfuscating or filtering through a character to protect myself from putting too much out there. But it got to a point where it was taking a lot more energy than it was worth to maintain that privacy. When we had our daughter, Calliope, it felt like this sudden release because talking and singing about our lives was becoming more and more integral to what we were doing as artists and who we were as people.\"\n\nThe title track, which draws on several traditional Mexican songs for musical inspiration, is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the life of a traveling musician hunting for a free place to crash, while \"Lose Touch With The World\" faces down the reality of living a life far removed from that of your friends and family, and \"Young Man\" is an earnest musing on growing older.\n\n\"It's about being a parent and coming to terms with what your ambition is,\" explains Wax. \"What part of that is essential to who you are, and what part can you let go of? We have to check in with ourselves and ask what we're doing and why we're doing it more often now because we're not just us putting ourselves through the mental and physical sacrifices of touring anymore,\" he continues. \"Now Calliope is going through it with us, and Suz's dad and my cousin Jordan are going through it with us on the road. And because we're constantly checking and making sure we're doing this for the right reasons, that we feel honest in our hearts about it, I think that's brought new life to what we're doing and a new energy and a new level of commitment.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment brought beautifully to life on \"Everything Changes,\" as Wax and Slezak sing, \"Everything changes / when two becomes three.\" The song was written in response to all of the good-natured warnings about what having a child would mean for the couple, the freedom and sleep and sanity they might lose out on. Instead, they choose to focus on everything they've gained: a beautiful daughter, a stronger bond with their families and fans than ever before, and without a doubt, the most exciting album of their career. For David Wax Museum, the stakes may be higher, but that just means the rewards are even bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Odyssey Road ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6629905.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "R&b, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul, Rock, Blues, Pop", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "James 'Bubba' Sanderford Vocals\nBorn in Memphis TN He played in High School Band from 7th grade through 12th, various instruments such as: Clarinet, Saxophone, Baritone, Oboe, Percussion, Bass and Guitar.

As he learned about Mozart, Bach and others, he began to realize that contemporary music is very simply the music of the pepople. The overtures and opuses of the 1700s were the popular songs of that era. People identified with those songs in the same way that today's \u201chits\u201d appeal to the masses of this generation. As a songwriter, specifically for liturgy in 2017, the question that provokes him is: How do I create a song that will honor traditions and music yet speak to the modern Church and lead them to worship?\n\nJosh collaborated with his guitar player, Grae McCullough, to write a new mass setting, paying homage to the hymns of the past and the culture of modern worship. \u201cEvery week we lead music for school and parish masses, so we knew we needed something that would resonate with all ages. We also wanted it to be joyful, approachable and easy to sing but still fresh, dynamic and expressive,\u201d says Blakesley.\n\nOn March 3, 2017 is the release of this long-awaited project called Mass of Restoration. It is available now anywhere music can be downloaded. For sheet music, please visit ocp.org\n\nJosh Blakesley's last full-length album, Even in This, was recorded in 2015 in Franklin, TN with Grammy Nominated producer/singer- songwriter, Michael Farren. The album features songs co-written with Farren, Mia Fieldes (Hillsong), Dove Award winner Marc Byrd (God of Wonders) and Grammy Award Nominated, Sarah Hart (Better than a Hallelujah).\n\nThe title track from the album is a song about finding hope in the darkest valleys of life. It was born out of tragedy after the band's guitar player, Grae McCullough, lost his one-month-old daughter to a chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18. \"The peace I had the day Lizzie's short life ended could have only been God. There was an underlying sense of peace in the devastation and the song really encapsulates the situation we were in,\" says McCoullough.\n\nBlakesley has been featured on Sirius XM, EWTN\u2019s Life on the Rock, Relevant Radio, KLOVE and has performed with wide variety of Christian artists like Matt Maher, Andrew Peterson, Jars of Clay and the Newsboys; as well as several International Papal events, most recently in Milan, Italy in 2012. He continues to tour heavily with dates booked all over the US and Canada in 2017. He partners with Compassion International as a spokesperson for releasing children from poverty in Jesus\u2019 name. He also works directly with the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Life Teen International, Catholic HeartWork Camp, Adore Ministries, as well as many churches, camps and conferences of all sizes in an effort to live out his calling and to \u201cmake disciples of all nations.\u201d (Matthew 28:18)\n\nJosh Blakesley currently lives in Houston, TX with his wife Heather and their two children, Sophie and Sutton.", "otherInfo": "REGISTER FOR THE VIRTUAL WCYR: https://arisemke.regfox.com/the-upper-room-virtual-wcyr\n\nThe Wisconsin Catholic Youth Rally was no exception to the flood of cancellations due to COVID-19.

A Blues Night in North Carolina, a recording from which Ole Midlife Crisis, a song he wrote and performed with Pura F\u00e9, placed at number 17 on France\u2019s iTunes blues chart in March 2011.\nCrow tribal member and son of an air force officer, Morin was born in\n1962 in Billings, Montana. He spent the bulk of his youth in Great Falls before relocating to Northern, Colorado. There, his musical career started off running with The Atoll, a band he founded in 1989 and that toured nationally, quickly gaining an enthusiastic and devoted following. With The Atoll and The Pura F\u00e9 Trio, and also as a solo artist, Morin has played celebrated venues across the globe, including Paris Jazz Festival, Winter Park Jazz Festival, Folk Alliance International, River People Festival, Shakori Hills Festival and the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Morin\u2019s performances have reached millions through national TV in Japan, France and the UK; and national radio in the US (NPR\u2019s Beale Street Caravan), UK (BBC\u2019s Whose London), France (RFI), Switzerland and Belgium.\nMorin\u2019s musical relationship with Pura F\u00e9 began during the stage show Tribe at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix. His stage credits also include co-authorship of Turtle Island, a 50-member production that played two consecutive years to sold- out audiences in Northern Colorado.

Yet the moniker is more than just a humorous takeoff on life's realities.\n\nBorn Matt the Electrician on a frosty San Francisco morn, Matt and his family soon moved to Oregon in search of culture, nice weather and vineyards. Once there, Matt spent much of his youth obsessed with Woody Guthrie, The Hollies and the soundtrack to Godspell. The Electrician's were A musical, yet thrifty family, so they found a swell garage-sale trumpet to encourage this musical interest.\n\nThe Electrician's moved back to California in the early eighties; and while the trumpet was eventually discarded, the expensive private lessons were not a complete waste, as it was here that Matt met and fell in love with the guitar.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the elder Electrician's spiraling oragami habit, money was not only extremely tight but intricately folded and beautifully hung all around the Electrician household, so Matt was limited to the only three chords his parents could afford. His dad assured him this was plenty, that kids in China only get one or two.\n\nAnd strangely, it all worked out. Matt headed to Austin, a serious music town, with aspirations of becoming a serious musician.\n\nMission accomplished. After years of a steadily-built, devoted fan base, some would say that Sever's unassuming baby-faced slacker image and \"nice guy\" blue-collar charm belie a very complex and intoxicating energy that is equal parts gritty neo-folk, frenetic boyish pulse, and tangled life experience - all held cohesive by his deft guitar skills and liquid vocals reminiscent of a young Paul Simon wrapped around a Tom Waits heart. Some wouldn't be able to say that. Some would rather type it. Others might yodel.\n\nMatt released his first CD, \"Baseball Song\", in 1998. \"Home\" in 2000, \"Made For Working\" in 2003 and \u201cLong Way Home\u201d in 2004.\n\nThe new CD, \u201cOne Thing Right\u201d, was recorded in Austin at The Aerie Studios; co-produced by Jud Newcomb, Mark Addison and Matt, and is slated for release\nin early 2007.

Like the best of the Nordic Noir leaving the Danish mainland, the recordings are at once both sonically pure and grimy; there\u2019s a shared loneliness that makes you feel that you\u2019re not at all; and all the while there is an honesty to the songwriting that tugs at your sleeve. While her grasp of English is second nature, there\u2019s some of those intriguing turns of phrase that only a heart that dreams in another language can weave: \u201cThe deep conceals things that are real/ look beyond the mirror/look beyond the mirror\u201d , \u201cI know we see things differently/as long as it\u2019s not separately\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re a fish in a bottle/a cock in a coop/the essence of trying\u2026\u201d\n\nSure, she has the usual credible influences from Vashti to Joni, from Neil Young to Danish folk hero Sebastian; and there\u2019s hints of Sandy Denny and Linda Perhacs. But to list artists she sounds like would be to miss the point entirely. As anyone who has witnessed a live show can attest, Ida Wen\u00f8e is very definitely Ida Wen\u00f8e.

Eric Johnson is now a permanent part of The Shins, although he continues to address the musical adventure that is the Fruit Bats. Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones. In 2006, Johnson became a member of The Shins, but remains committed to the Fruit Bats. The band plans to release a fourth album sometime in the near future.", "otherInfo": "Watch Fruit Bats (https://youtu.be/R2qxOtDvQio) in their 2019 Woods Stage performance for Pickathon #AConcertADay!

Her distinctive and brutally honest songwriting, paired with her energetic performances, come through seamlessly no matter where her music is played, live on the stage or in her critically acclaimed recordings.\n\nSince she began writing music when she was a teenager, the essence of Nicole Rayy\u2019s music has always been, first and foremost, to express herself as honestly as possible. When pressed for musical comparisons to her musical ability, the Oakville, Ontario-born Rayy is reluctant to provide. For as long as she\u2019s been playing music, she has been herself. Comparisons are easy to fall back on, but for Nicole, her music should always speak for itself.\n\nNicole Rayy first blasted into the Canadian Country music scene in 2012 with the release of her debut EP \u201cOnly Everything\u201d. She went on to release her debut full-length album Dig, in October 2016. The highly anticipated album, continued in the theme of uncompromising honesty and challenges listeners, as well as Nicole herself, to dig deep down to the emotional core of themselves. Produced at Noble Street Studios in Toronto by renowned Record Producer/Writer and Musical Director Doug Romanow, whose long list of clients include Justin Bieber, Johnny Reid, Chantal Kreviazuk, and the Canadian Country Music Awards. The album showcases Rayy\u2019s tonal range and relatable sentiment perfectly\n\nThe release of the album was celebrated by a performance and fundraising event at Cowboys Roadhouse in Winnipeg, MB, which raised over $4000 for the Manitoba Neurofibromatosis Support Group (MBNF). It was shortly after the event, that the title single \u201cDig,\u201d also released in October 2016, started to make its way on to radio stations across Canada. The single was highly supported nationally and garnered over 63,000 streams on Spotify.\n\nWith the success of the album and single \u201cDig,\u201d Nicole released her next single \u201cFireproof\u201d March, 2017, and embarked on a radio tour throughout Ontario and across Western Canada. \u201cFireproof,\u201d hit immediate success among music programmers and directors, and to date has received over 155,000 streams on Spotify.\n\nThe single took Nicole into what became a very exciting 2017, seeing her invited back to perform at such festivals as Manitoulin Countryfest, The Calgary Stampede and Burlington Ribfest, sharing the stage with artists such as The Chris Buck Band, Crystal Shawanda, and Joe Nichols. Nicole was also invited to showcase at the Country Music Association of Ontario Roadshow in Ottawa, NSAI Toronto\u2019s Tin Pan North, Diamonds In The Rough during Canadian Country Music Week in Saskatchewan, SK, and Indie Week Canada in Toronto, November 2017.\n\nNicole has also had the honour of performing at the World Music Festival in Shanghai, China, for three years in a row (2015-2017), and will be returning again in 2018, proving to be a hit among Shanghai\u2019s enthusiastic crowds.\n\n2018 began with an opportunity to open for Brett Kissel in Barrie, Ontario, and continued with multiple festival performances including Dauphin Countryfest, Trackside in London and the main stage at the Howl at the Moon festival in Manitoba opening for Aaron Pritchett and Brett Kissel\n\nIn June Nicole was honoured to be nominated for Rising Star by the CMA Ontario and her latest single \u201cBad Habit\u201d was released and has been very popular with her fans this summer.\n\nWith a sound that is distinctly her own and a creative ambition that knows no bounds, Nicole Rayy feels right at home either on a stage or in a recording studio and will never stay put in one place for too long.

The album announces Regen as a formidable talent with the rarest of gifts - an original voice that speaks to the human condition with authority and hope. Regen\u2019s songs define our times, but are meant to last for all time.\n\nRegen knows a thing or two about navigating the unexpected. Coming of age in the 1980s, he nourished himself on a steady diet of MTV and synth pop. And while he could have spent his life in search of New Wave glory, he instead moved to New York City and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of jazz piano great Kenny Barron, toured with artists like Little Jimmy Scott and Kyle Eastwood, and slowly carved-out a name for himself as a solo artist who defied easy categorization.\n\nLike Bruce Hornsby before him, Regen creates infectious melodies that often belie the music\u2019s harmonic sophistication. Like Randy Newman, he draws on the richness of the American musical vernacular, distilling an ocean into a creek the artist can call his own. It\u2019s on the axis of those seemingly diverse worlds that Jon Regen\u2019s sound is born. It's also on the axis of differing worlds that Higher Ground sprang to life.\n\nHaving experienced a new level of artistic success following his critically-acclaimed 2015 album Stop Time (produced by Mitchell Froom and featuring members of Elvis Costello\u2019s Imposters), Regen wasn\u2019t eager to rush into the studio for a follow-up. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going to make a record of just any songs, produced just any way,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI never gave up the idea of recording again, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to make the same album I did last time. I wanted to be inspired.\u201d\n\nParenthood helped Regen meditate on several factors. \u201cI wondered if, in this new divided world \u2013 and in this era of instant internet fame, if music still resonated the way I remembered it could.\u201d\n\nWith no stream of roadwork planned (he was too busy being a full-time dad), Regen played local shows around New York City and dug into his work as the Editor of Keyboard Magazine. \u201cFor the first time in decades, I had a regular jazz gig,\u201d he says. \u201cI became reacquainted with the piano in a way I hadn\u2019t been able to while I was constantly touring. I also threw myself into my writing work, relishing the chance to explore the inspiration behind otherpeople\u2019s music.\u201d Then in September 2018, Jamiroquai\u2019s Matt Johnson invited Regen to the group\u2019s gig at the Forest Hills Tennis Center in Queens, New York.\n\nThe location proved remarkable: Regen\u2019s parents had lived on the same street during the 1960s. Possibly more remarkable was the gig itself: \u201cI saw 14,000 people dancing to funk music in the New York rain that night, and my faith in the healing power of music was instantly restored.\u201d\n\nWhen Regen and Johnson met at the afterparty, they hit it off instantly, despite being something of an unlikely pairing. \u201cMatt\u2019s a proper British synth whiz, and I\u2019m a gravely-voiced New York singer/songwriter. But I thought, \u2018Maybe there\u2019s something to this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair wrote the song \u201cWide Awake\u201d as a way of testing the waters - with Johnson in London and Regen at home in New York City. And despite the distance, the duo struck creative magic. \u201cIt was just this great marriage of Matt\u2019s studio wizardry and my songwriting and piano styles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cFunnily enough, that song would never have been born had I not bought an old Roland Juno-60 synthesizer and started fooling around with it on top of my Steinway grand piano. But once I did, I knew I was onto something fresh. It was a sound that was new to me, so I chased it.\u201d\n\nJohnson says, \u201cWhen he sent me his idea, I was struck by the rich quality of his voice. As the track progressed, I learned that Jon could also play great jazz piano. For me, this album shows off all the best in Jon - great songs, great piano and a truly distinctive voice.\u201d\n\nBut a lingering question remained: Could the duo record an entire album without anyone ever playing in the same place at the same time? They were about to find out.\n\nFor Regen, making the album became a mission unto itself, regardless of the challenges the pair faced. \u201cI wrote lyrics while my son watched \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 and recorded piano and vocals in my apartment while he napped,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore we knew it, the project was materializing before our eyes.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to formidable companions, Regen enlisted an all-star cast that reads like the lineup of a supergroup; keyboardists Benmont Tench, Chuck Leavell, Ricky Peterson (David Sanborn, Fleetwood Mac) and Matt Rollings (Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson,) signed-on, as did Duran Duran\u2019s Nick Rhodes.\n\n\u201cFor someone who used to air drum to Rio as a kid, hearing Nick\u2019s synth work on my music was positively surreal,\u201d Regen says. \u201cIn a lot of ways, this record is about the moment when your heroes become your peers.\u201d\n\nTench says that there was never a second thought about lending his talents to the album. \u201cNot only is Jon an annoyingly great piano player,\u201d the veteran keyboardist says, \u201che isn\u2019t sitting still in the songwriting department, either: this is a laudable leap forward in both style and expression.\u201d\n\nHaving scored a premiere rhythm section for his previous album, Regen was once again drawn to top players like bassists Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell) and Tim Lefebvre (David Bowie, Tedeschi Trucks Band), and drummers Keith Carlock (Steely Dan) and Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel). Previous Regen collaborators like guitarists Andy Summers (The Police) and George Marinelli (Bonnie Raitt) return here, as do cellist Julia Kent and Swiss harmonica ace Gr\u00e9goire Maret. And as impressive as the guest list on Higher Ground is, what\u2019s even more miraculous is that every musician played his or her parts in their respective hometowns. The entire album was recorded remotely, across different cities, oceans and countries.\n\nListening to Higher Ground, it\u2019s not hard to imagine what led musical luminaries to join in. The album strikes the perfect balance between gravity and levity, between deep introspection and knowing when to cast worries aside and get down to celebrating the moment.\n\nThe album opener \u201cWide Awake\u201d gives us a glimpse of the myriad of styles Regen pulls from. Funky, R&B grooves collide with jazz and pop flourishes, and lyrics that never overstate the tune\u2019s status as a love song. And the title track \u201cHigher Ground\u201d sounds like something culled from an earlier time and, perhaps, like John Hiatt\u2019s \u201cHave a Little Faith\u201d not just a song but a hymn to the heart. \u201cThat one is for my son,\u201d Regen remarks. \u201cThe lyric, \u2018I\u2019m a better man now, \u2018cause I stand on higher ground\u2019 is about him showing me what\u2019s really important in this world. The title became a mantra for the entire album, pushing me to elevate my singing, songwriting and piano playing at every turn.\u201d\n\nAs good as he is at walking in the alleyways of America\u2019s musical past, Regen moves himself into the contemporary via the socially-conscious \u201cWho Cares If Everybody Else Knows.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lyric that all right-minded people can relate to,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cand I feel it\u2019s where I took Jon furthest from his comfort zone musically. The track sounds completely modern and Nick put in some really interesting sounds at the end to finish it off.\u201d\n\nOn other tracks, Regen\u2019s piano mastery is firmly on display. \u201cHole in My Heart\u201d features a dreamy, triple-tracked piano solo that channels the best of early Bowie and later Hornsby. The libidinous, New Orleans-inflected \u201cEvery Night\u201d recalls Dr. John at his swampiest. And \u201cEast Side Blues\u201d pits Regen\u2019s blues-drenched piano against the street noise of his native New York City, marrying humor with high musical art.\n\nOne song, \u201cThe Last to Go,\u201d bridges Regen\u2019s recent past with the music of his youth. \u201cBenmont played on that one and recorded the organ at Mitchell Froom\u2019s studio in Los Angeles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cMitchell produced my last album, Stop Time, and played the first organ solo I ever heard, on Crowded House\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over.\u2019 And so the circle completes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Last to Go\u201d not only summarizes many of the album\u2019s themes, it\u2019s also unquestionably a new high in Regen\u2019s compositional output. \u201cIt was the last song I wrote for the album,\u201d he says. \u201cI was up late in New York City one night, thinking about the album and my approaching birthday \u2013 of where I have been, and where I still hope to go. I traced my life back through big events, and more personal earthquakes. And of course, with the world we live in now full of disinformation and vitriol, we all look for a guiding light. My wife is that for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I wrote that song, I called Benmont to play organ on it. Because nobody can move air on a Hammond like Ben. He also had his daughter on the exact same day I had my son, and I had a feeling he feels about his wife the way I do about mine.\u201d\n\nThe balance between light and dark heard on the album is not lost on Regen. \u201cLooking back at the album now, I see it\u2019s full of both optimism and fear,\u201d he says. \u201cSongs like \u2018Wide Awake\u2019 and \u2018Higher Ground\u2019 speak to the power of love and family and the happiness they bring. But songs like \u2018Who Cares If Everybody Else Knows\u2019 and \u2018Before\u2019 are darker. They are me grappling with the madness of life as a new parent in 2019 \u2013 where no one seems to stand for anything besides greed and power. Those are tough sentiments to reconcile. In the end, I suppose life is about just that \u2013 how to explain the unexplainable.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Southern Halo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10212195.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Pop Country, Country, Contemporary Country, Modern Country, Country Pop, Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Mississippi Delta, recognized by many as the birthplace of Rock and Roll and the Blues, is heavily rooted in the upbringing of the Morris sisters.

My granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy was born in Caswell County in 1795. Maybe we go back further, I don't know.\n\nOn Friday the 13th, November 1970, I was born at the Cape Fear Valley Hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, probably the biggest military town in the country. Fort Bragg alone covers 250 square miles, and the used car dealerships and titty bars are like stars in the sky, grains of sand on the beach. The ground is sandy and the woods are open and piney, with tall loblollies, jack oaks, and the longleaf pine.\n\nWe left for Fort Worth, Texas when I was about 2 or 3, so that dad could attend Southwest Theological Seminary. My first memory is of crossing the Mississppi in a U-Haul. My dad was excited about the bridge and couldn't stop talking about how it was an engineering marvel and all.\n\nFrom there, the memories get thicker, catching tarantulas after a rainstorm, putting pennies on the railroad track, barefoot ooching across the Texas road, so hot the asphalt was soft. There was a snowstorm. We've got pictures.\n\nDad got a commision to preach in an English-speaking church in what was then West Germany, in a little town called Vernheim. Our landlord worked for Mercedes, got a new one every year, and kept a weinkellar like a liquor store. Dad would give me the rent check, I'd walk it upstairs, and the hausfrau would pinch my cheeks and give me a chocolate bar as big as my head.\n\nIn church, my father preached and my mother played piano for the services. I learned how to sing in that church and even did a solo of \"Amazing Grace\" for the congregation. We had a piano in the house and my mom gave me some lessons. I did really well, but I got bored with the workbook/lesson plan style. My brother had a guitar and that was cooler. We moved to Giessen a few years later and he got \"The Wall\" for a birthday present from a friend. Mom and Dad almost didn't let him keep it, 'cause there were \"disturbing images\" on the inside. They relented and Gray taught me my first guitar piece, that cool acoustic guitar solo in A minor. I was 8.\n\nWhen I was about ten, we came back to the states, my daddy lost his mind, divorced my mom, and started drinking and managing Eckerds drug stores. He went through another wife and found the construction industry, wherein he could stay drunk all day. That finally lead him to recovery and he spent the rest of his life building houses for storm victims and Habitat whenever he could. He was a good man with a lot of demons, and he married a third time 'til death did he part in 1999. His favorite song was \"Amazing Grace\" and his vinyl bluegrass collection influenced me greatly, especially Flatt and Scruggs and the Stanley Brothers. He bought a banjo once and became so frustrated with it that he turned it into a clock.\n\nMom was a rock through all of that, got a good job at UNC, paid a man to build her a log cabin in the country outside of Chapel Hill, and did her best to raise me. I was a real pain in the ass. Once I got my own guitar, I had a place to put all my teen angst, but it didn't help my schoolwork at all. I probably set records for non-attendance and spent a lot of time running around in the deep woods of western Orange County. Four years in the high school jazz big band program taught me the majority of what I still know about music theory. Along with an early enlistment in the Navy, music got me through and out into the real world, where I finally got my ass kicked.\n\nI spent the next four years touring the Mediterranean on a tank landing ship out of Little Creek Naval Base in Norfolk, VA. The open ocean is a powerful thing to behold. The stars at night are unlike anything you will see on this Earth anymore; it is the last great wilderness. Besides that, being tear-gassed was about the most fun I ever had in the Navy. I carried a guitar behind my bunk everywhere we went and made strange four-track recordings when we were in port and there was an empty berthing to use as a late-night studio. Of all the guys I knew on ship, I still remember the names of the ones I played music with- Robert Thomas, David Saylor, Hadji Henderson.\n\nAfter my time was up, I spent some days in Virgina Beach, playing in a heavy rock band called Coup d'Etat at first, and then Day 11, which was just a license plate we saw at a grocery store one day. We were sort of prog, like Bad Brains meets King Crimson and we rubbed Tiger Balm on our nads before we took the stage because Fishbone said that they did. They probably said that just to see if anyone would do it. A girlfriend gave me my first acoustic guitar, a Fender; I think she stole it. She stole enough money from me that I think I paid her for it.\n\nVirginia Beach outright sucked, so I came home to work at Weaver Street Market and started another band called Scalliwag. I knew there was something missing from my culinary life (mac'n'cheese, ramen, pizza) and the job at Weaver Street was a cry for help. It turned out to be the social hub of Carrboro, NC and I met a lot of people who are still my close friends today. The rock band thing wasn't working out, so I started playing the acoustic more and met a lot of other acoustic musicians.\n\nMy friends Leo Lorenzoni and Michael Kovich told me about an Old-time fiddler's convention up in Buena Vista, VA and it sounded like just a laid-back, weekend-long party. I cruised up there and hung out with them; I can't even remember if I had a tent. It changed my life and it changed my music, just banging away on an A chord for hours at a time and sippin' that corn liquor. I didn't know the songs and I didn't care. Whatever these people had a hold of, I wanted some of it. It shot straight down into my veins like lightning and made my hair stand up on end. The music was intense, lyrically cut down to the bone, no bullshit. They didn't have bridges; bridges were for pussies. People got killed, died or fell in love and then got killed or maybe drank themselves to death. They weren't gonna be treated this way and they'd trade their shoes for a little bottle of booze. They were big, like John Henry and Wild Bill Jones, all fists and whiskey, heartbroken and angry as I was, ready to kill somebody.\n\nI started going to Clifftop and Mt. Airy and finding Old-time jams at home and on the road, anywhere my new friends lived. I got to thinking that I could write songs like that, or maybe one just fell out of me and I thought, \"Wow, there it is.\" Either way, I figured nobody was writing songs like that anymore, at least nobody I'd heard, and I knew that style was just technique. In other words, those songs didn't sound old because they were old; they sounded old because they were written in an old style. There wasn't a reason in the world why somebody couldn't write a song like that, if he wanted to.\n\n\"Ashe County Fair\" was probably the first song I wrote like that. Another one was \"Velma,\" a song I wrote about the woman who killed my grandfather. I think somebody dies in most of the songs on my first album. Three of them die in \"Velma.\" I was also playing Irish music by the time I recorded, so I played the guitar parts in an alternate tuning, DADGAD. In retrospect, it gives the whole album a dark, open sound that takes the themes over the edge and out into the dripping woods.\n\nI started touring full-time in 2000, realizing that I could do it as a solo performer and actually make a living. Of course, that's what every other singer/songwriter in America was doing, too, but I didn't even know what a singer/songwriter was, so that didn't bother me. I thought I was a folk musician. Over time, I realized that folk got cross-dressed and don't mean what it used to mean anymore. I think my friend Aengus Finnan said it better than anybody I've heard yet, \"It's a style of presentation.\" So that's just it, as long as you don't put on the razzle-dazzle and shake your ass in a sequin skirt, you can be a folk musician. Sit there on a stool and play your tuba, tell a story once in a while and wear some Birckenstocks. Everybody will think you're a folk musician.\n\nIn 2002, I went to the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas, where there are lots of these folk musicians, only mostly songwriters. I wandered around for a week looking for the dance tent and the fiddle bands before I realized what I've already said about the word \"folk.\" It ended up being an amazing and inspiring experience and I've been for all 18 days every year since. At the 2003 festival, I won the New Folk competition and got hired on as a performer for the next three years. I never took to Birckenstocks and my friend Anais Mitchell helped me find a great pair of boots in Austin. They're Fryes.\n\nIn 2004, Dromedary and I recorded an album together called \"The Sea and the Sky,\" which brings beautiful instruments from all over the world into my sound and songwriting. I've toured in Europe and the US with them, including a return to Kerrville and two consecutive years at the Moab Folk Festival in gorgeous Moab, Utah. If you're not familiar with Dromedary, I highly recommend you go to dromedarymusic.com right now- well, after you read the rest of this, anyway. Their music is magic, like the voice of Emmylou Harris, an instant drop in the shoulders, a glaze on the eyes, a trip back to childhood. I'm honored to be friends with them and occasionally share the three-man funk in a rental car.\n\nThe next album was a rock 'n' roll album called \"This Is The New That.\" Rock 'n' roll, because I just didn't know how else to play these songs. They're rock 'n' roll songs. It leads off with a revision of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" Dromedary came back into the studio with me and played electric guitars. Rock 'n' Roll Hall-of-Famer and Muscle Shoals session guitarist Will McFarlane sits in on a few. It was amazing to watch him work, a blue-eyed gent in a kilt ripping the blues from stem to stern. When the first take was done, there were no questions and nothing left to be done but get the cat off the ceiling. What a pro.\n\nWill McFarlane told me a story about recording with Frank Sinatra, wherein Frank walked in and sang the whole album, no retakes. The engineer asked him to sing the first few words of the first song again, because he hadn't had time for a line check. Apparently, Ol' Blue Eyes squared his shoulders and told the engineer, \"Overdubbing's for faggots,\" and walked out. Political incorrectness aside, I rather like his style.\n\nTexas is a huge influence on my writing. \"The Law and the Lonesome\" is what might have happened if Townes Van Zandt had made a record with Doc Watson. Tamara Kater of Canada's venerable folk mag Penguin Eggs called \"The Law and the Lonesome\" her \"album of the decade.\" Co-produced by the brilliant Chris Bartos in Toronto, \"The Law and the Lonesome\" features a couple of co-writes with my friend Corin Raymond. We wrote the title track together, which was featured in a songwriting class at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nI beat \"Radio Soul\" and recorded \"Cackalack\" in six hours with a handful of the best musicians in Toronto, although it sounds like it was recorded in a barn in North Carolina. Ken Whitely, who has gold and platinum records to his name, engineered the record in his converted garage with Nik Tjelios. As of mid-January 2011, \"Cackalack\" was #1 on Roots Music Reports folk radio chart. I went back to Canada and made a record in two days in Gimli, Manitoba with Alexa Dirks of Begonia and Andrina Turenne singing harmonies. Joanna Miller, Rej Ricard, and Grant Siemens round out the all-star Winnipeg crew.\n\nJonathan Byrd & The Pickup Cowboys is my latest record and project. We play every Wednesday at a little roadhouse called The Kraken on highway 54 outside Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The residency has become a community for some and a pilgrimage for others. Tune in on facebook live, 7-10pm Eastern Time any Wednesday, or make the trip to join us.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013. He's lent his vocal expertise to many local releases, and appears on MUSHROOMHEAD\u2019s album, \u201cBeautiful Stories For Ugly Children\u201d, singing on the track \u201cHoles In The Void\u201d\n\nAnd not to be outdone Joe has released three cd\u2019s of original material, \u201cJUST JOE SOLO EP\u201d (December 2011), \u201cMy Demons, My Burden, My Life\u201d (May of 2012) and \u201cGot Joe?\u201d (December of 2012). And now after a very successful Kickstarter campaign, Joe\u2019s next album, \u201cSo The Story Goes\u2026\u201d will be released this Spring 2013!!\n\nUpstate New York born and bred.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jaimee Harris ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365139.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Folk-rock, Folk, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jaimee Harris is poised to become the next queen of Americana-Folk, a slightly edgier Emmylou Harris for the younger generation.\n\nHer new album draws comparisons to Patty Griffin, Ryan Adams, and Kathleen Edwards \u2013 all writers who know how to craft a heartbreakingly beautiful song with just enough grit to keep you enthralled. Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults.

When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week.

My father who was a fine art painter and an architect would sit me on his lap and play name that tune with many classical pieces of music! Watching him paint and listening to classical music and opera as well as many other types of music was what my childhood was rich with.\n\nSoon enough I was also drawing, painting and playing music. I was especially into poetry, lyrics and songwriting having been exposed to this in early education by a teacher who was particularly fond of folk music. Simon and Garfunkel, Cohen, Dylan - we studied these amazing writers in our English classes. I adored writing poetry and this inevitably led to songwriting and learning my chosen instrument, the piano. I had a love affair with anything that included piano. I was influenced by the classical masters as well as early Elton John, Billy Joel, The Beatles - all kinds of music. Motown was also a big influence as well as classic and traditional Spanish music that my Mom would sing around the house. I had a rich tapestry of influences to drawn on and learn from.\n\nMy love affair with drawing and painting was also very strong, eventually leading me to study art at The Alberta College of Art in Calgary. I became a very successful award winning illustrator working on many important campaigns over the years and illustrating with Rick Jacobson, 17 children's books and many book covers, three of these books ( the most recent) authored by us as well as illustrated.\n\nIt wasn't until 6 years ago that the music career I had put aside rose to the surface with a vengeance and I began to once again write and perform all over Toronto. I recorded my first CD, The Other Side, in 2003 and this led to an invitation to the New York International Independent Music Festival where my band was awarded Best Soft Rock Band (there were over 600 bands in the event).

Jessica was then selected by American Idol\u2019s judges, Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez, and Harry Connick, Jr., for Season 13 of the TV series where she rose to be a Top 4 National Finalist. Jessica also became the first person in the history of Idol to perform her own original song during the finals and joined Idols LIVE Tour, performing in 40+ cities across the USA and Canada.\n\nJessica is signed to LA Group Management and \"Halfhearted\" marks her first full-length album release on Warrior Records.

The song's music video has been honored with awards at seven different film festivals. \u201cI wrote Love Her Better after dating a guy for 4 months,\" notes Jessica. \"It was long enough for his true colors come out\u2026he thought it was ok to cheat on me with his ex-girlfriend AND a married lady!

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015. Previous projects include Home to You from 2010, Topaz City in 2007; One of the Ways, 2002; Wide Afternoon, 2000; Comfort In the Curves, 1997; and three live releases (Sell-Out, 2006; Live From The Granada CD/DVD 2009 and Live At The Mucky Duck - Portmanteau, 2019).

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

The music needed to exist, and it was as much an emotional exercise as a creative one.\n\u201cI think every other record that I've written, I wrote knowing that the songs would have an outlet,\u201d Costa says \u201cAnd for this one, I really didn\u2019t. It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating. But now everyone's going through something. And as difficult as that is, there's comfort in that too. Because we're all in it together, and we have been the whole time. Except now we can actually feel it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Michael Martin Murphey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10385149.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Western, Wildfire, Country Music, Singer-songwriter, Cowboy Music, Classic Country, Folk Music, Bluegrass", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "It\u2019s September, 1972. The legendary Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, TX is hosting two nights of sold-out shows with headliner Michael Martin Murphey and his opening act Willie Nelson. Until now, the Armadillo has presented mostly rock acts.\nRolling Stone magazine has heard the shows might be special so it sends their top man in Texas, Chet Flippo, to cover the event. Flippo soon declares in Rolling Stone that Murphey is \u201cthe best new songwriter in America.\u201d\nMurphey has just released his acclaimed genre-bending Geronimo\u2019s Cadillac, and on this night he and Nelson present their unique fusions of pop, rock, folk, cowboy ballads, hard-core country, jazz and reddirt bluegrass. It is a night that defies all the music norms of the time; a night that some will call \u201cthe birth of modern Americana music.\u201d\n\u201cMurphey was a key player in the Austin phenomenon,\u201d Craig Havighurst of WMOT \u2014 The String recently observed. \u201cMurphey, along with Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker and others forged a country-rock hybrid that became the foundation for the progressive folk music field we now call \u2018Americana\u2019.\u201d\nNow 50 years after he began pioneering that music scene and laid the foundation for what we now call Americana music, Murphey presents Austinology: Alleys of Austin. It is both a celebration of that era and a look at the seminal period that turned Austin into one of the music capitals of the world.\nNative Texan Murphey already had songwriting success in Los Angeles when he returned to Texas and landed in Austin in the late 1960s. Still, Murphey says moving to Austin made him a better songwriter and a better performer due to the friendly association with other writers and performers who followed him to Austin and gave birth a burgeoning creative community that included Jerry Jeff Walker, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffett, Gary P. Nunn and other soon-to-be legends like Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt.\nFor Austinology: Alleys of Austin, Murphey chose music styles that defined the period as he explores why it perpetuated itself. He is joined by several artists who were part of that era as well as those influenced by the work the originators created:\n\u2022 Willie Nelson (on \u201cAlleys of Austin\u201d and \u201cCosmic Cowboy\u201d)\n\u2022 Steve Earle (on \u201cGeronimo\u2019s Cadillac\u201d),\n\u2022 Lyle Lovett (on \u201cAlleys of Austin,\u201d \u201cCosmic Cowboy\u201d and \u201cDrunken Lady of the Morning\u201d)\n\u2022 Kelly Willis and Bruce Robison (on \u201cLittle Bird\u201d)\n\u2022 Jerry Jeff Walker (on \u201cCosmic Cowboy,\u201d \u201cAlleys of Austin\u201d)\n\u2022 Amy Grant (on \u201cWildfire\u201d)\n\u2022 Randy Rogers (\u201cBackslider\u2019s Wine\u201d)\n\u2022 The Last Bandoleros (on Guy Clark\u2019s \u201cLA Freeway\u201d)\n\u201cThis album is not just about my songs,\u201d Murphey said. \u201cIt\u2019s about style and substance that makes a song that stands the test of time, a song that has a chance of living on in the Great American Songbook.\n\u201cSo I did my personal take on songs by Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Jerry Jeff Walker, Allan Damron as well as songs made popular by Willie and Waylon,\u201d he continued. \u201cI stayed with songs that came out when I was there \u2013 between 1968 and 1974 \u2014 because I personally experienced what the impact of that songwriting style was on the culture. [Laughs] Because I was there, you know? And I grew up with the mix that created the original American music: African- American Blues and Spirituals, Tejano/Irish/ German/ Cowboy Ballads and Dance tunes including Native American music.\u201d\nMurphey has traveled extensively and engaged in ranching throughout the West, but remained a Texas resident through it all, even as he topped the International and National Pop, Country, Bluegrass and Western music charts with such huge crossover hits as \u201cWildfire,\u201d \u201cCarolina In The Pines,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Forever For,\u201d \u201cLong Line of Love,\u201d \u201cGeronimo\u2019s Cadillac\u201d and \u201cCowboy Logic.\u201d\nThrough all the chart-jumping and genre busting, Murphey has remained constant to an honest, sincere approach to his songwriting. He is no more country than rock, no more bluegrass than classical, no more folk than jazz. He is, rather, a true AMERICAN songwriter. His stubborn determination to be the best songwriter possible has led to his songs being covered by such artists as Lyle Lovett, John Denver, Kenny Rogers, Hoyt Axton, Cher, Manfred Mann, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, and more.\nMurphey came of age in the local Southwestern folk music scene, starting with a Bohemian club called the Rubiyat in Dallas and other acoustic venues in Austin, Houston, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Denver.\nAfter briefly attending the University of North Texas (which had its own thriving music school), Murphey transferred to UCLA and worked his way through college as a singer / songwriter while excelling as a student of poetry, songwriter and performer.\nBut a growing family and the pull of his Texas Cowboy roots brought him back to Austin in 1968 \u2013 where he began a new musical movement with the help of Rod Kennedy (founder of Kerrville Folk Festival), Segle Fry (club manager and folksinger) and UT ethnomusicologist Roger Abrams. In May of 2018, the Country Music Hall of Fame honored Murphey\u2019s contribution as a founding member of the Austin music scene as part of their three year Outlaws and Armadillos exhibit. He\u2019s come full circle to his Cowboy roots, having recently been given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum and Cowboy Hall of Fame.\nPerhaps most striking about Austinology: Alleys of Austin is how good songs weather the years, which is precisely why such celebrated songwriters as Earle, Grant, Walker, Nelson, Lovett and as artists like Garth Brooks, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Ray Wylie Hubbard and more cite Murphey as a major influence on their own craft.\nWith the release of Michael Martin Murphey\u2019s Austinology: Alleys of Austin, his legacy is impacting new generations.", "otherInfo": "Live performances by Michael and friends from their homes and usually solo performances.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cWEST COAST WEDNESDAYS\u201d EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

She is a veritable triple-threat of musical talent as a guitarist, songwriter and vocalist. As with many blues women of the past, Foley has a long history of defying convention, and being a positive role model for aspiring, young female musicians.\n\nThe Canadian has been working professionally since the age of 16, and by the age of 21, Foley had relocated to Austin, TX and began recording for Antone\u2019s\u2014the esteemed blues label and historic nightclub that helped launch the career of Stevie Ray Vaughan and many others. In the two decades that have followed, Sue Foley has been busy touring and recording steadily, all while toting her signature pink paisley Fender Telecaster. In 2001, she won the prestigious Juno Award (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy) and also holds the record for the most Maple Blues Awards and has earned three Trophees de Blues de France. She has also garnered several nominations at the Blues Music Awards in Memphis, TN.\n\nWith 11 recordings under her own name, an instructional DVD and book, as well as various compilations and projects, Foley is set to release her new album, The Ice Queen (March 2, 2018) on Stony Plain Records. \u201cI\u2019m extremely excited to be working with Holger Petersen and Stony Plain Records. Holger is one of the most knowledgeable \u201creal music\u201d people in the business\u201d, says Foley. \u201cStony Plain is known to put out great music and I know The Ice Queen has found her home.\u201d\n\nRecorded throughout 2017, The Ice Queen represents Foley\u2019s full circle journey \u2013 her return to the roots of her career in Austin with producer Mike Flanigin. The album was recorded with her long-time friends and collaborators Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons (ZZ Top) as well Chris \u2018Whipper\u2019 Layton from Double Trouble, Charlie Sexton, and members of the Tedeschi Trucks and Gary Clark Jr bands.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teenager I idolized Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons,\u201d Foley says. \u201cThey're both legends now so this feels like an historical event (at least it does for me). And I grew up sitting at the feet of players like George \u2018Big Beat\u2019 Rains, Derek O'Brien and The Texas Horns. I spent many nights watching Charlie Sexton and the Arc Angels with Chris Layton. I learned and grew more musically in my years in Austin than at any point in my life. The fact that all these mega talented musicians have graced my album is beyond anything I hoped for. I am still pinching myself.\u201d\n\nA flood of inspiration and themes can be found on each of the tracks \u2013 ranging from lost love, anguish, and struggle to release, forgiveness and rebirth. Mostly recorded live-off-the-floor, Foley\u2019s emotional vocal delivery, conviction, accessible yet inspired lyrics and intrepid guitar playing are all laid out, bare and raw for the songs to reveal.\n\nOpening with the radio friendly and funky \u201cCome to Me\u201d, The Ice Queen also features upbeat and rollicking tracks \u201cRun\u201d, \u201cThe Lucky ones\u201d (a duet with Jimmie Vaughan) and \u201cGaslight\u201d. There are several bluesy and soulful tracks including \u201c81\u201d, \u201cThe Ice Queen\u201d, \u201cFool's Gold\u201d (featuring Billy F Gibbons on vocals and harmonica)\u201d, \u201cIf I Have Forsaken You\u201d, and a cheeky, guitar-heavy cover of Bessie Smith\u2019s \u201cSend Me To The \u2018Lectric Chair\u201d. Foley also provides some more mellow and unexpected songs on The Ice Queen with the jazzy \u201cDeath of a Dream\u201d, the flamenco-blues hybrid \u201cThe Dance\u201d and a beautiful cover of the Carter Family\u2019s \u201cCannonball Blues\u201d.\n\nThe Ice Queen represents Sue Foley\u2019s indefatigable commitment to her craft, and her transparency with the journey that birthed her, further proving that\nyou can\u2019t keep a good blueswoman down, particularly when she is The Ice Queen.\n\nsuefoley.com", "otherInfo": "Texas Blues Party, the NEW weekly livestream show featuring Sue Foley & Mike Flanigin.

This soft-spoken Oregon native\u2019s inspired songwriting produces propulsive R&B grooves, infectious melodic hooks, and stylish ballads with equal ease. He plays jazz piano with the harmonic sophistication and deep sense of swing that only comes from more than four decades on the bandstand. At the same time, his recordings have consistently landed at the top of the New Adult Contemporary (NAC)/Smooth Jazz charts, a genre of music Tom helped pioneer in the mid-80s. As the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most renowned musical artist, Tom Grant\u2019s career achievements reflect his unique ability to embrace the full spectrum of contemporary music. Born to show business parents, Tom was at home with many musical instruments, but always returned to the piano. At a tender age, he was taught to play piano and drums by his tap dancer father. Later, he learned about music styles listening to music at his father\u2019s record store in Portland, Oregon. His brother, an avant-garde jazz pianist, introduced him to the many different facets of jazz music.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oregon and a short stint as a high school teacher, Tom answered his musical calling. Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper took Tom to New York in 1970 to record the chant classic Witchi-tai-to. After that, he toured and recorded with such jazz greats as Woody Shaw, Joe Henderson, Charles Lloyd and Tony Williams. Since 1983, Tom\u2019s records have repeatedly topped the Smooth Jazz charts. Several, including the popular Mango Tango, Night Charade, In My Wildest Dreams, and The View from Here, enjoyed lengthy stays at Number One. Tom\u2019s music has been a staple of terrestrial and internet radio both in the U.S. and around the world. His compositions are also used in TV and Films worldwide. He has been featured on CNN and the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tom is also a tireless worker for humanitarian and charitable causes. He has a scholarship established in his name by the United Negro College Fund. In 1999 Tom was also given the Humanitarian Award for Dedication to Music, Health and Children by the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell Medical Center.\n\nMore recently he has dedicated himself to numerous charity projects for the under-funded public schools in the Northwest, Potluck in the Park, a charity that feeds hungry people in the Portland area, and the Edwards Center for handicapped adults. In 2001, Tom started recording on his own record label, Nu-Wrinkle Records. After nearly 35 years of recording on various labels (Windham Hill, Verve, Shanachie, PAUSA, Gaia, WMOT, Timeless International, Chase Music) he felt it was time to explore the world of self-produced music. In 2013, he has undertaken new projects by other artists.\n\nStay tuned.", "otherInfo": "Tune in every Wednesday night to hear Tom Grant Live on Facebook.\n\nPlease post your song requests on Tom\u2019s Facebook page BEFORE 4 PM on show night.\nVirtual Tip Jar: https://venmo.com/TomGrantPDX\n\n#TomGrantPDX #SocialDistanceSessions #SignoftheTimes #AdaptingtoChange #Letthemusicplay #Allinthistogether #TogetherAlone #TheShowMustGoOn #SupportTheArts\n#FindingtheGroove #ReachoutandTouch #Stayhopeful #StayhomeSaveLives #BeKind #socialdistancesessions, #homealone, #stayathometour, #staysafestayhome, #flattenthecurve #stayhome #withme #PDXjazz"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Markus Mars ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10340651.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Electronica, Ambient, World Fusion, Experimental, Funk, Folk, Jazz Fusion", "Time": "4:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Live looping artist and multi-instrumentalist Markus Mars composes entire concerts in front of the audience - with the audience.

Whether playing as a duo with her husband Will Sexton or with retro-country sensation Motel Mirrors, she\u2019s an inventive, thoughtful singer-songwriter who has crowds throughout the US and Europe smitten.\n\nMusic fans first discovered this \u201csweet soprano\u201d on This World is Not My Home in 2005, but it was her Jim Dickinson-produced breakout albumAnchors & Anvils two years later that put Amy LaVere on the map.\n\nThe success of Anchors & Anvils drew the attention of the UK market, and soon Amy was invited to perform on the BBC\u2019s \u201cLater with Jools Holland\u201d \u2013 the appearance introduced her to an international audience, and to Craig Silvey (Arcade Fire, Jamie Cullum), who she\u2019d later team with to produce Stranger Me (Archer Records).\n\nSpin called the 2011 release \u201cthe break-up album of the year,\u201d Paste said it was \u201camong the year\u2019s best,\u201d and it earned a first listen feature from NPR\u2019s All Things Considered. She followed it in 2014 with another critical smash: Runaway\u2019s Diary, a concept album based on her own experience as a teenage runaway, produced by Luther Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars). American Songwritercalled it \u201cboundary pushing\u2026 heartfelt, reflective, challenging and consistently compelling.\u201d NPR Music\u2019s Robert Christgau said it was her best yet.\n\nHer most recent release, Hallelujah I\u2019m A Dreamer (Archer Records, 2015), was a surprise for fans just nine months after Runaway\u2019s Diary, recorded with LaVere\u2019s husband and noted guitarist Will Sexton. On Hallelujah, Amy and Will capture the immediacy of the live show they developed on the road together, reveling in a more stripped-down sound and celebrating the freedoms and limitations that come with it in stunning form. No Depression said simply: \u201cpure bliss.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her solo records and a tireless touring schedule, Amy enjoys collaborating with other artists. In 2012 she joined an all-star collaboration called The Wandering, composed of Amy, Luther Dickinson, Shannon McNally, Sharde Thomas and Valerie June. They released Go On Now, You Can\u2019t Stay Here (Songs Of The South, 2012) to critical acclaim and sold out shows.\n\nIn the afterglow of The Wandering, Amy and Shannon McNally hit the road together and released an EP titled Chasing the Ghost, The Rehearsal Sessions (Archer Records, 2012) which featured songs from both artists recorded live during rehearsals for the tour.\n\nAmy next paired up with noted rocker John Paul Keith to create Motel Mirrors. Their styles clearly complemented one another, which made for magic on stage and in the recording studio. Their eponymous vinyl EP release was named one of the \u201c10 Essential Albums of 2013\u201d by No Depression.\n\nAlthough she\u2019s a singer and songwriter first, Amy is also an actress. In 2005 she was cast in the role of Wanda Jackson in the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line (Twentieth Century Fox). Since she has appeared in a variety of independent and studio productions: Black Snake Moan (Paramount, 2006), $5 Cover (MTV, 2009), Woman\u2019s Picture (2011) The Romance of Loneliness (2012) and most recently with Grace Zabriski in Only Child (2015).\n\nIn 2017 Amy is keeping a busy tour schedule and writing songs for a new album to be recorded later in the year.

After a five year reign in the realm of grime, Williams found himself veering towards the world of house music.\n\nIn 2010 a number of zeitgeist releases from Williams proved too good to ignore, one such release was hit record \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 featuring vocalist Terri Walker. The track played extensively worldwide before settling in at no.2 as iTunes best dance track of the year.

This seal of approval saw Tesfa play at London's world renowned Fabric, in room 1 alongside Groove Armada and Moxie.

Shorr was born and raised in Portland, Maine on July 11, 1994, where she was the youngest of seven children born to a single mother. Shorr soaked up a rich variety of influences from her siblings, and at the age of six, she began writing songs. At 13, Shorr learned to play guitar and gained experience playing in a rock band in Portland, singing Pink Floyd and Nirvana covers in a friend\u2019s basement. While she loved rock and pop, Shorr was certain that her future lay in country music after hearing Johnny Cash's cover of \"Hurt, originally by Nine Inch Nails. Determined to make her mark, Shorr took extra classes so she could graduate from high school early, and then held down two jobs at once so she could raise the money to move to Nashville.\n\nBy the time she was 19, Shorr had settled in Music City, and she landed a job at a hot dog stand while she searched for an audience to hear her songs. Things began looking up for Shorr when she became part of a weekly songwriter\u2019s showcase called Song Suffragettes that highlights the work of talented female singer/songwriters in Nashville. Song Suffragettes helped raise Shorr\u2019s profile which resulted in her first publishing deal, solidifying her dream of becoming a professional musician in Nashville.\n\nWith two of her fellow Suffragettes, Hailey Steele and Lena Stone, Shorr wrote a song about resilience titled \u201cFight Like A Girl\u201d and released it as an independent digital single in January 2016. The tune quickly won positive press and airplay on digital radio and social media sources with SiriusXM\u2019s The Highway channel naming Shorr a \u201cHighway Find\u201d and CMT making her part of their \u201cArtist Discovery\u201d program. With that momentum, she released The Y2K Mixtape, an eight-song collection of some of Shorr\u2019s earliest music that led to her becoming 2016\u2019s second best-selling debut female in all of country music (behind only Grammy-winner Maren Morris).\n\nAirplay of a second single, \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You\u201d, led into 2017 where Shorr and her next EP, Slingshot, received a barrage of critical acclaim from Rolling Stone Country (\u201cArtist You Need To Know\u201d), Taste of Country (\u201c2017\u2019s Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d), Sounds Like Nashville, Morning Hangover, Country Music Chat, Whiskey Riff and CMT. Teen Vogue came calling and in May 2017, the publication named Shorr one of \u201c10 Female Artists Who Are Changing the Music Game\u201d. She was the only country artist featured in their annual music issue which specifically dubbed Shorr \u201cThe New Nashville\u201d. Later that year, Kalie was named to the CMT Next Women of Country Class of 2018, a prestigious list that recognizes the newest and brightest female artists in country music.\n\nCreatively, Shorr spent most of 2017 writing songs and working on a new sound that infuses her country core with many of the rock influences she grew up on. Producer and songwriter Skip Black (Jana Kramer, Theory of a Deadman) helped her finally find the common thread that connects the big guitars of rock music to the story-telling and passion for lyric that cements her in country. It was a deep dive into song craftsmanship and sonic production that yielded her first 2018 single, \u201cTwo Hands\u201d, featured on Shorr\u2019s newest EP Awake.\n\nAmidst critical acclaim for her punk-country sound on Awake, Kalie was named one of the \u201cTop 10 Country Artists To Watch In 2018\u201d by the Huffington Post just as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d was added to prominent playlists at SiriusXM The Highway, Radio Disney Country, TuneIn's Country Roads, Pandora, Amazon Music and Apple Music. The \u201cTwo Hands\u201d music video was also added to CMT, GAC and to Vevo's DSCVR Country playlist.\n\nIn January 2018 after being inspired by speeches at the Golden Globe Awards, Kalie co-wrote a song called \u201cTimes-Up\u201d that went on to be recorded by 23 women of Song Suffragettes with an accompanying music video that received major press coverage from the Associated Press, Boston Globe, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, Voice of America and many more including a feature on Grammy.com.\n\nShorr recently wrapped the CMT Next Women of Country Tour with country superstars Sara Evans and RaeLynn and will continue extensive touring throughout the summer.\n\nIn May, Shorr was the only independent artist named to Taste of Country\u2019s \u201c2018 Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d list just as her brand new single \u201cCandy\u201d hit radio airwaves and streaming playlists.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Henry Fong ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8928339.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Bass House, House Music, Progressive House, Dance Music, Electro House, Melbourne Bounce, Trap, Electronic Dance Music", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Henry Fong:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/djhenryfong\nhttp://twitter.com/henryfong\nhttp://soundcloud.com/henryfong\nhttp://instagram.com/djhenryfong\nhttp://youtube.com/henryfong\n\nPromos: henryfongpromo@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Azalea ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9482749.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Folk-pop, Contemporary Roots", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Benjamin & Mia Hackett are the Australian/Canadian husband & wife musical collaborative known as Azalea. The way their voices blend together in song conjures an imagined romance, much like their own. Before they met, Benjamin and Mia worked hard at their craft but each felt separately, something was missing. Their first songwriting session together, in 2004, led to the discovery that what they were missing was each other. Fast forward to today, they have now released five studio albums, one live album, were named semi-finalists at the 2018 International Songwriting Competition, and were nominated at the 2018 International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nTheir most recent project, \u201cLive at Home\u201d was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, at a house concert in Azalea\u2019s living room. The recording captures the acoustic heart and soul of six songs from their 2017 studio release, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, two new original songs, and a cover of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d, from the motion picture \u201cOnce\u201d. Tickets were sold as a crowdfunding perk to help raise funds to record the aforementioned studio release.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was released on October 13, 2017 and was supported by a multi-province 2 week tour. Written and recorded in their home studio, this project features love songs, beautiful vocal harmony and showcases Benjamin & Mia\u2019s musical abilities. The album sits comfortably in the \u201cContemporary Roots\u201d genre featuring songs that borrow from North American and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as conventional pop sensibilities.\n\n\u201cI See The Church\u201d from the album \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was nominated at the 2018 IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) in the \u201cBest Group/Duo\u201d category .\n\nHamilton Blues Lovers Blog has this to say about the album,\n\n\u201cHamilton musical duo, Azalea keeps growing with every recording and their latest, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d proves it. The production is amazing and they\u2019ve created a fabulous melding of pop and roots music. Their lush vocal harmonies flow through the entire album as the sometimes infectious and always beautiful melodies bolster the sound. It\u2019s a perfect mix of vocals and music that can\u2019t help but effect you emotionally\u2026\u201d\n\nIn May 2015 Azalea was hand picked by GigSalad & CD Baby to play their junket for Canadian Music Week in Toronto, Ontario. In honour of this occasion, Azalea recorded and released a limited edition EP called \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d. As a salute to GigSalad & CD Baby\u2019s DIY methodology, \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d was made completely in house with fabric bound hand packaging.\n\nIn 2013, Azalea released the EP \"Inside Out\". An album which streamlined their folk- tinged pop sound and showcased songs to tug at the heart strings with haunting melodic and harmonic lines. Reminiscent of The Civil Wars, and Fleetwood Mac \u201cInside Out\u201d shed light on Azalea\u2019s Alt-Country side. The pitch for its successful crowd- funding campaign gave some insight into their work:\n\n\". . . it has always been our goal to release quality music that is culturally relevant and speaks to the heart. . . . However, we wanted to take listeners on a journey beyond the routine of everyday life to the place that connects them with their emotions, beliefs, and values in a real way.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012 Azalea released \u201cAt the End of This Year...\u201d, their seasonal single which has received the nod of approval from CBC radio.\n\nAzalea\u2019s 2010 release, \u201cCoffee & Kisses EP\", was among the top three finalists for Recording of the Year, Rock Recording of the Year, Instrumentalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the 2010 Durham Region Music Awards. The album was featured in prominent music magazines and generated good response from college radio across Ontario.\n\nYears before anyone knew Benjamin & Mia Hackett as Azalea, they performed, travelled, and recorded an album as Benjamin & Mia. \u201cThe Carousel of Life\u201d (2007) is the root of their love for each other and for their musical life together. That first album thrust them into the life they know, love, and hope to express in song, to every listener.\n\nAzalea\u2019s chemistry is undeniable - their stage presence magnetic! To experience Azalea in concert is to be invited into their love story. They will will draw you in and pull on your hearts strings. Azalea will take you on an emotional rollercoaster as they move through their repertoire of simple & sweet love songs, then take you south with swampy tunes which are full of rich vocal harmony and live looping. Two complementary voices supported by guitar, piano, \"suitcase-kick-drum\u201d, and foot tambourine create a breathtaking concert experience.\n\nA must see for fans of \u201cFleetwood Mac\u201d, \u201dThe Civil Wars\u201d, and the film \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d.\n\nAzalea is currently performing on board cruise ships around the world.

Longtime friend Mike Bishop Smith (drums) completes the trio. With a unique blend of genres, thoughtful lyrics and superb musicianship, the band has garnered and vast and diverse following. Releases include 8 singles, 3 EPs and 1 full length album.\n\nIn mid-2019, The Powell Brothers changed shape. The band of four and five pieces became a fierce three piece power trio. As a power trio, the group\u2019s sound evolved from roots influenced Country/Americana to alternative influenced Country/Rock. On July 1, 2020, The Powell Brothers released their new single entitled \u201cHow It\u2019s Done.\u201d \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is emblematic of the band\u2019s new hard hitting Country/Rock sound. The track has major attitude. Hot out of the gate, the listener is hit with powerful electric guitar riffs backed by a driving drum beat and gritty bass tones.\n\nThe story of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is based on a conversation between a young aspiring artist and an old man at a bar. The old man reflects on his life as a hardworking, blue collar laborer and the young artist shares his dream about \u201cmaking it\u201d in the music business. The old man tells the young artist that life is tough and the road is bumpy and long, but if he is willing to work hard enough he can accomplish anything. The chorus of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d sings:\n\nStoke the fire and keep on diggin\u2019\nmake the most of what you\u2019re given\nit may seem cold and it may seem tough\neven steel will bend when you heat it up\n\nYou\u2019re on the road to better days\nif you can outlast the sun and outlast the rain\nand a lot of hard lessons made\nLet me tell you son, soon you\u2019re gonna show us how it\u2019s done\n\nThis track will be on The Powell Brothers\u2019 next EP set to release in the Fall of 2020.

After 12 years of playing as many as 300 shows each year, Rev. Peyton, the world\u2019s foremost country blues finger-style picker, along with the biggest little band in the country has pieced together one of the most dedicated followings out there. This following is sure to eat up the bands latest offering, Poor Until Payday, (the second on their own Family Owned Records label through hip Nashville indie Thirty Tigers) out October 5th, a country blues record that was made the right way \u2014 two feet on the ground and both hands getting dirty.\n\nWith all the power of a freight train, the Big Damn Band is known for its live shows. Rev. Peyton delivers guitar pyrotechnics the old fashioned way \u2014 ten fingers, a 6 string and an amp cranked at full tilt. In the country blues style, he plays the bass with his thumb, while picking the lead with his fingers at the same time. When he lifts the guitar behind his head to play there's nothing but skill and 16 gauge nickel strings to make the soundscoming out of the speakers.\n\nBeside him on stage are just two other people. His wife, \u201cWashboard\u201d Breezy Peyton playing with all the nuance and percussive power of a New Orleans drum line, and keeping the train moving is Max Senteney on a lean drum kit including a 5 gallon maple syrup bucket. Together they play Peyton's wildman country blues that's as much ZZ Top as it is Bukka White.\n\nOn Poor Until Payday Peyton wanted a sound as live and electric as the records made in the heyday of 45 rpm blues classics from Chess, Stax and Sun Records. Playing his\nbeloved custom-made National steel resonator, a 1949 Harmony Archtop, a 1954 Supro Dual Tone and a 1955 Kay Speed Demon through a 1949 Supro amp, Rev wanted to restore the \u201cwarmth, pops and hisses\u201d mostly eliminated by modern-day compression. The band played in a room together with minimal micing (using only the best classic pieces they could get) with the main effect being tape saturation.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe result is an album that is direct, soulful and demands to be played loud.\n\nThe themes of songs like the title track, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Steal My Shine\u201d and \u201cI Suffer I Get Tougher\u201d offer the antidote to today\u2019s hard times by touting \u201cperseverance, inspiration and hope\u2026 being your authentic self despite everything lined against you, a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d With a vocal style reflecting both the soulfulness and bite of his idols, Rev has added world-class singer to his already-renowned skills as a finger-pickin\u2019 guitar\nphenom. Breezy and Max also contribute background vocals to most of the songs, with \u201cThe Miss Elizabeth of Country Blues\u201d actually taking the spotlight with a sultry call-and- response showcase on \u201cDirty Swerve,\u201d in which she also contributed to the writing.\n\nPeyton's blues pedigree is well established. Woodshedding since he was 12, Peyton has kept alive a tradition of finger picking pioneered by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt. However, Peyton plays with the energy and attitude of a Howlin' Wolf. Indeed if it has strings he can play it whether that's a custom-built National, a cigarbox, an axe or even a shotgun (seriously, Google it.).\n\nHe's done his homework and been given the blessing of the gatekeepers of the tradition \u2014 even befriending and touring with some of the last of the great Delta Blues and Hill Country blues legends like David \u201cHoneyboy\u201d Edwards, T-Model Ford (whose grandson calls him Unk), and Robert Belfour.\n\nRev and Breezy make their home in rural southern Indiana near the adopted home of bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, among national parks and forests in what began as an artist\u2019s colony. \u201cMost of the people here can both paint a picture and skin a deer,\u201d laughs Breezy.\n\nTheres nothing dusty or sentimental about Peyton's music, though. Theres no songs about picking cotton. They aren't a museum piece. The Big Damn Band have taken nearly a century of blues songsmanship and crafted a thing all their own. There is not a single act out there that sounds like this.\n\nThe Big Damn Band make friends and fans every place they go \u2014 and there are few places they haven't been, having performed in 37 countries. After Poor Until Payday, the only people who won't be on the big damn bandwagon will be people who haven't heard or aren't paying attention.\n\nThis is real, from the heart, handmade music made by people, for people who don\u2019t have time for BS.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tegan&Sara ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "J.

Being on stage with Chicago was such an honor for me and I had the time of my life!\u201d\n\nJeff\u2019s latest album, ORIGINS was released in December 2019 and has been well received by fans and the music industry as Coffey\u2019s vocal abilities really shine through on this album. ORIGINS is a tribute album to all of the great tenor singers and the songs that inspired Jeff to become a professional musician and includes songs by some of the greats, like Sr. Paul McCartney, Sting, Queen, Journey, Foreigner and more.\n\nJeff continues to write and record new music, collaborating with many different artists and songwriters.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.
