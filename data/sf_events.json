Now, with her full-length debut Keepsake, the Australian singer/songwriter tries on countless new textures, exploring everything from industrial to new wave to dance-pop, handling each with understated elegance and pure, powerful feeling.\nIn the making of Keepsake, the Brisbane-bred musician, otherwise known as Harriette Pilbeam, recorded in a home studio in Melbourne and worked again with John Castle -- the producer behind Sugar & Spice, a 2018 release that prompted Pitchfork to dub her the \u201cdream-pop idol of tomorrow.\u201d And while the album begins and ends with two massively catchy pop tracks -- the brightly defiant \u201cNot That Kind,\u201d the euphoric and epic \u201cKeep\u201d -- many songs drift into more emotionally tangled terrain, shedding light on experiences both ephemeral and life-changing.\nThroughout Keepsake, Hatchie\u2019s kaleidoscopic sonic palette draws out distinct moods and tones, continually revealing her depth and imagination as a musician and songwriter. On lead single \u201cWithout a Blush,\u201d jagged guitar riffs and woozy rhythms meet in a sprawling piece of industrial-pop, with Hatchie\u2019s gorgeously airy voice channeling loss and longing, regret and self-doubt. Another industrial-leaning track, \u201cUnwanted Guest\u201d unfolds in wobbly synth lines and fantastically icy spoken-word vocals, along with lyrics about \u201cbeing dragged to a party I don\u2019t want to be at, then getting at a fight at the party, and kind of hating myself for it but hating everybody else too.\u201d Meanwhile, on \u201cHer Own Heart,\u201d Hatchie presents a radiant jangle-pop gem that puts a singular twist on the post-breakup narrative. \u201cI\u2019d seen people in my life go through breakups and end up with no idea what to do with themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cI wrote that song from the point of view of a girl who winds up on her own and embraces having to figure out who she is, who doesn\u2019t let her life get turned upside-down like that.\u201d\nElsewhere on Keepsake, Hatchie brings an unlikely transcendence to the most tender of moments. With its softly pulsing beats and slow-building intensity, \u201cSecret\u201d spins a heartrending anthem from what she describes as \u201cconfiding to a friend about your mental health struggles, the things you can\u2019t work out on your own.\u201d On \u201cKiss the Stars,\u201d Hatchie\u2019s cascading guitar work and mesmeric vocals meet with lyrics capturing a precise form of melancholy. \u201cWith that song, I wanted to recreate the feeling of a Sunday afternoon when the sun is setting and you don\u2019t want the day to be over -- that awful end-of-weekend feeling,\u201d she says. And on \u201cStay With Me,\u201d Hatchie offers up Keepsake\u2019s most utterly rhapsodic track, all incandescent synth and unstoppable rhythm. \u201cAt first I thought I could never put that on my album -- it felt too dancey and pop, and I figured it could really shine on someone else\u2019s record,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I realized: I\u2019m the one dictating what my sound is; what I put on my album is up to me.\u201d\nThat self-possessed spirit infuses all of Keepsake, which ultimately serves as a document of a particularly kinetic moment in Hatchie\u2019s life. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a nostalgic person when it comes to memories, but I do have a tendency to hold on to certain things, like tickets from the first time I went someplace on holiday,\u201d says Hatchie in reflecting on the album\u2019s title. \u201cIt made sense to me to call the record that, at a time when I\u2019m going to probably end up with a lot of keepsakes -- and in a way, this whole album is almost like a keepsake in itself.\u201d\nOrchin\nOrchin is the LA-based project of Jeremy McLennan, described by The Fader as a hybrid of \u201cshoegaze, Cocteau Twins-style dream-pop, and new wave.\u201d Launched in late 2016, the band has since released a string of singles and played with acts such as DIIV, Hatchie, Tamaryn, and Model/Actriz. After a year-long performing hiatus to focus on recording, the band recently relaunched their live act with a fresh set of songs from their debut album, due this summer. The new material marks a progression in McLennan\u2019s sound, taking cues from pop, acid house, and country, and drawing inspiration from artists like Duster, Gram Parsons, and Arthur Russell.

Another industrial-leaning track, \u201cUnwanted Guest\u201d unfolds in wobbly synth lines and fantastically icy spoken-word vocals, along with lyrics about \u201cbeing dragged to a party I don\u2019t want to be at, then getting at a fight at the party, and kind of hating myself for it but hating everybody else too.\u201d Meanwhile, on \u201cHer Own Heart,\u201d Hatchie presents a radiant jangle-pop gem that puts a singular twist on the post-breakup narrative. \u201cI\u2019d seen people in my life go through breakups and end up with no idea what to do with themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cI wrote that song from the point of view of a girl who winds up on her own and embraces having to figure out who she is, who doesn\u2019t let her life get turned upside-down like that.\u201d\nElsewhere on Keepsake, Hatchie brings an unlikely transcendence to the most tender of moments. With its softly pulsing beats and slow-building intensity, \u201cSecret\u201d spins a heartrending anthem from what she describes as \u201cconfiding to a friend about your mental health struggles, the things you can\u2019t work out on your own.\u201d On \u201cKiss the Stars,\u201d Hatchie\u2019s cascading guitar work and mesmeric vocals meet with lyrics capturing a precise form of melancholy. \u201cWith that song, I wanted to recreate the feeling of a Sunday afternoon when the sun is setting and you don\u2019t want the day to be over -- that awful end-of-weekend feeling,\u201d she says. And on \u201cStay With Me,\u201d Hatchie offers up Keepsake\u2019s most utterly rhapsodic track, all incandescent synth and unstoppable rhythm. \u201cAt first I thought I could never put that on my album -- it felt too dancey and pop, and I figured it could really shine on someone else\u2019s record,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I realized: I\u2019m the one dictating what my sound is; what I put on my album is up to me.\u201d\nThat self-possessed spirit infuses all of Keepsake, which ultimately serves as a document of a particularly kinetic moment in Hatchie\u2019s life. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a nostalgic person when it comes to memories, but I do have a tendency to hold on to certain things, like tickets from the first time I went someplace on holiday,\u201d says Hatchie in reflecting on the album\u2019s title. \u201cIt made sense to me to call the record that, at a time when I\u2019m going to probably end up with a lot of keepsakes -- and in a way, this whole album is almost like a keepsake in itself.\u201d\nOrchin\nOrchin is the LA-based project of Jeremy McLennan, described by The Fader as a hybrid of \u201cshoegaze, Cocteau Twins-style dream-pop, and new wave.\u201d Launched in late 2016, the band has since released a string of singles and played with acts such as DIIV, Hatchie, Tamaryn, and Model/Actriz. After a year-long performing hiatus to focus on recording, the band recently relaunched their live act with a fresh set of songs from their debut album, due this summer. The new material marks a progression in McLennan\u2019s sound, taking cues from pop, acid house, and country, and drawing inspiration from artists like Duster, Gram Parsons, and Arthur Russell. Orchin\u2019s first single from their album will be out this July.", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Du Nord"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Meg Baird", "ArtistBio": "No artist bio available", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Wed Sep 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-25", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "OtherInfo": "Yo La Tengo", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Big Light", "ArtistBio": "Big Light is a rock band from San Francisco, CA based in San Francisco, CA.

That's no joke, and it was a very fitting beginning for this plucky bunch of misfits. Their brand of original Americana encompasses a wide spectrum of musical styles from bluegrass to blues from classic country swing to heady jam band rock (as rocking as you can get with mandolin, stand up bass and acoustic guitar).\nThe three lead singers\u2019 voices could not be more different from one another and yet, when they come together in three-part harmony, the powerful sound delivers a heavy dose of musical charm.\nThe Salty Suites are Scott Gates (mandolin, vocals), Chuck Hailes (stand up bass, vocals) and Chelsea Williams (vocals, acoustic guitar). Scott Gates, a native to the Southern California bluegrass scene, plays the mandolin with a healthy mix of finesse and mayhem. His ear-bending tones can go from sounding like classical mandolin to electric guitar and everything in between. And to add insult to injury Scott is also an exceptional singer and songwriter. Chuck Hailes, who started out playing jazz and classical bass, has evolved into quite the musical mischief-maker. His playing style ranges from dulcet bowing tones to off-kilter funky grooves, and he might just break your heart with his beautifully poignant original songs. Singer Chelsea Williams has a voice that is one part honey and two parts whiskey. Her sweet sound can turn to gravel in an instant and her bittersweet songs tempt you into believing that you might actually enjoy a little bit of heartache.\nTickets are $15 in advance and $18 at the door, general admission; $10 advance, $13 at the door for students with ID. Children under 12 are free. Advance tickets are available at the link below, or you may purchase your tickets at the door the night of the show. Doors open one half hour before show time. We accept cash only at the door (ATMs are nearby). The Back Room is an all-ages, BYOB (for those 21+) space, dedicated to (mostly) acoustic music of all kinds.

Now LA-based and with three albums under their belt (last one being 2017\u2019s Without A Sound), festival appearances from KABOO to Bonnaroo, and features from Billboard and Rolling Stone, they are of turning over a new sonic leaf this year.\n\nThe Main Squeeze released their newest single, \u201cFancy Clothes\u201d on January 18th. Following in the wake of the release of \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me\u201d last October, these two singles mark the start of something new and fresh for the Indiana-to-Chicago-to-Los Angeles transplants. The singles play up the modern dance-pop vibes of Bruno Mars and Charlie Puth - while channeling the swag, grit and soulful sounds of 70s bands like The Rolling Stones and Sly and the Family Stone. Produced by Teddy Roxpin \u201cFancy Clothes\u201d is a tongue in cheek dance track that reflects the spotlighted LA culture in which The Main Squeeze lives.\n\nWith a rich touring history including opening slots for The Roots, Jane\u2019s Addiction, D.R.A.M., Mac Miller, Aloe Blacc, and Umphrey\u2019s McGee, The Main Squeeze are launching into a new musical orbit with plans for a fourth LP in 2019.\n\nCornerstone\n2367 Shattuck Ave.\nBerkeley, CA 94704\nPhone: (510) 214-8600", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Cornerstone Craft Beer & Live Music"}, {"Address": "1517 Franklin, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "B Wiley", "ArtistBio": "B Wiley is Ben Wiley, a producer and musician whose mission is to bridge the gaps between many styles of music.

Then he discovered the blues, and his life dramatically changed. With his Little Village Foundation debut, \"Aki Goes to Bollywood\", Kumar began integrating elements of Indian music into his musical and visual presentation, making for a multi-cultural mash-up that sounds like no one else, yet never loses touch with its blues foundation. Kumar\u2019s follow-up album, \"Hindi Man Blues\", boasts his most ambitious cross-cultural fusion to date, and features liner notes by veteran blues great Charlie Musselwhite. Kumar recently performed at the prestigious Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival, has been featured on PRI \u201cThe World,\u201d and has toured in Russia, South America and Scandinavia.Hailed as a star among the next generation of West Coast blues artists and versatile in many different styles of roots music, Kumar is equally at ease rocking a Jimmy Reed number in English as he is belting out a signature, swingin' re-interpretation of a Bollywood classic in Hindi.

With each performance comes an opportunity to remind the whole of humanity that we all live on a spectrum. That we flourish in our softness, and command with our depth.
