Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "98 Mountain View Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95407", "Artist": "Small Hat", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9523631.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.71007, 38.379067], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Blues-Rock, Southern Rock, Soul", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Red Hawk Farm", "moreBioInfo": "Delivering their unique sound of soulful alternative southern rock, Small Hat features family members Mandy, Cosmos, and Zoz, along with various special guests, with the intention to inspire and connect with their audience.

As the Truth or Consequences, NM-based \u2018Harmonic Alternative Folk\u2019 duo Flagship Romance they live, work, and annually travel tens of thousands of miles together, deeply in love with each other and the process of bringing their emotionally powerful music to the people. It is an inspiring union of hearts, minds and souls that entrances all who encounter them and their art.\n\n\"Their songs & vocals have a simmering intensity... I also suspect Fisher used to play in rock bands, as he tended to attack his guitar with an unbridled ferociousness.\" - Mayer Danzig // Twangville\n\nFluent, intense acoustic guitar playing; lyrics of life\u2019s peaks, troughs, mysteries and wonders; soaring, yearning vocals; tender, though oft-anthemic melodies, and harmonies one could barely separate with a single human hair: this is the Flagship Romance sound. Live, sharing a custom-built dual microphone stand, they deliver their beautiful material with passionate abandon, living each song as if it will be the last they will ever perform. Such commitment to their music and stagecraft has, in just a few short years, seen the aptly-monikered Flagship Romance become huge favourites of the North American house concert circuit. This suits them just fine, as Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s preferred performance scenario is an intimate venue where the audience is tucked up close enough to them that they can hear them breathe (and, unfailingly, gasp at Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s chemistry and dynamics). Yet they have also appeared at festivals, clubs and concert halls, sharing stages with international acts including Half Moon Run, Iris DeMent, Mason Jennings and the Goo Goo Dolls.\n\nFlagship Romance are on the road for upwards of eight months a year, and have been pretty much since the release of their 2013 debut EP, The Fudge Sessions. If ever a testament to this extraordinary work ethic were needed, it would be the reaction to the crowdfunding campaign they launched to finance their 2014 full-length debut, an ambitious and ultimately stunning CD/DVD project entitled Fee Fie Foh Fum. Recorded live off the floor \u2013 difficult to comprehend considering its quality \u2013 the album captures the bristling energy of Flagship Romance live shows, and was created with the considerable backing of the duo\u2019s rapidly burgeoning legion of fans, to the tune of over $25,000.\n\nOn the back of such a successful project, one that emphatically delivered on their promises, a sophomore full-length was hotly anticipated. Lo and behold, another overwhelmingly positive Kickstarter campaign ensured that Flagship Romance could craft 2017\u2019s Tales from the Self-Help Section exactly as they wished to, employing a subtly richer sound and new vocal approaches by Jordyn. Produced by Lucio Rubino at The Fish Tank Recordings in St. Augustine, FL, Tales from the Self-Help Section is a personal, largely self-examining and emotional 12-song opus, documenting \u201cthe little victories, failures and lessons\u201d Shawn and Jordyn have experienced during the last couple of years, \u201cmostly dealing with the battles of \u2018being present,\u2019 and living with depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nOn the evidence of their gorgeous work to date it is clear that the love and skill of which John Ruskin spoke intertwine in perfect harmony in the cases of Shawn Fisher and Jordyn Jackson, and that, indeed, little masterpieces are the results. Yes, Ruskin would have loved Flagship Romance.\n\n......\n\nFlagship Romance has aligned their musical career with the clean water cause via the organization charity: water. In August 2012, Fisher and Jackson founded and organized the Clean Water Music Fest in Florida, to raise funding and awareness for the 800 million people on this planet without access to safe, clean drinking water. Since then, they have raised over $125,000; 100% of that money is currently being used for well building and tap-stand projects in Ethiopia, Rwanda, and the Sahel region of Africa.\n\nBiography by David Morrison, Folk Radio UK", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "22519 Main St, Hayward, CA 94541", "Artist": "Sunny And The Black Pack", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8910643.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.083819, 37.673485], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, R&B, Rock, Blues, Jazz Blues", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "The World Famous Turf Club", "moreBioInfo": "Since 2015, Sunny And The Black Pack have been building a reputation as true visionaries in the music scene.

After a name change and a self-released 10 inch album called \u201cSneakers\u201d, which sold amazingly well, the band caught the attention of Columbia who signed them up and sent them into the studio with a big budget to record their first real album, \u201cSupersnazz\u201d, on the Epic label. Their next two albums were on Kama Sutra (home of their heroes, The Lovin' Spoonful): \u201cFlamingo\u201d, and the now revered classic \u201cTeenage Head\u201d.\nLead singer Roy Loney left the band right after that and lead guitarist Cyril Jordan moved the group to England with Chris Wilson (formerly of Loose Gravel) taking over as front man. They continued their style of straight ahead guitar driven rock n' roll but this time with a more 60's rather than 50's influence. A few singles on United Artists, recorded at the legendary Rockfield Studios in Wales with Dave Edmunds producing, followed in the early '70s. In '76 they signed to Sire Records, who released three true gems of power pop: \u201cShake Some Action\u201d, \u201cFlamin' Groovies Now\u201d, and \u201cJumpin' In The Night\u201d.\nAnother lineup change ensued in the next decade with Wilson moving to England and joining the Barracudas. The Groovies continued on thru the 80's and into the early '90s touring Australia and Europe, putting out a fine but overlooked album called Rock Juice and then finally calling it quits. Jordan formed a new band called Magic Christian while Wilson released solo albums in Europe.\nNow in 2017, Jordan, Wilson led quartet have gone back into the studio to cut an album of brand new material. Having toured the world for the past five years, fans have been delighted with what is being called \"a dream set list\", including original songs the band has never performed before onstage. Newcomers are asking, \"Why haven't I ever heard of this group?\" It's hard to say just why the group hasn't gotten the attention they deserve (at least in the USA) but they're back to give everyone another chance at hearing and seeing just why those in the know consider them one of the greatest rock n' roll bands ever.", "otherInfo": "$32 adv / $35 door"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Maggie Forti", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9521814.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "\"Maggie Forti's songs travel straight from her heart into yours.

We use them all the time, in passing, and with varying degrees of sincerity. But as meaningful as these sentiments can be, there are also equal amounts of moments in life, where we watch our opportunity to say them pass. The moments play out like a Hollywood movie reel, in slow motion. A significant life event occurs, we lose a loved one, we fall in love, or we find ourselves out of control, and like a crescendo in a powerful symphony, our moment comes, but for whatever reason, the words are stuck in our throat. We miss our chance.\n\nThe second EP release from acoustic rocker Benny Bassett is a collection of variations on this theme, titled \u201cWords for Yesterday\u201d. Each song, presents a different scenario where the actor, maybe the artist himself, is lamenting the inability to say what needed to be said. Whether it is a fleeting chance at love in \u201cFrom You\u201d, or the gut-wrenching apology in \u201cWindow to Forever\u201d, Bassett attempts to illuminate the process of recovering from inaction. \u201cThis record is about a collection of moments where we either wish we had taken the opportunity to act, or where we try to act, but the moment has passed, or the intended audience has moved on\u201d, says Bassett. What he found through the time leading up to the creation of this album, is that \u201cyou start to doubt yourself, and your ability to live in the moment as a genuine being \u2026 you relive this quintessential life moment over and over, and try to chase down what you should have done. It can be self-defeating, depressing, and ultimately it can take a long time to realize your opportunity is gone.\u201d\n\nThe third track on the EP \u201cDown Below\u201d is an anthemic rocker that drives home the point. The lyrics paint a protagonist enveloped by the flames of controversy, left over as the result of a relationship gone wrong. \u201cThat song gets at the heart of this record\u201d, says Bassett. \u201cBreakups are always difficult, but if neither person gets closure, each of them tells a different story about why it happened, and often times it can get ugly.\u201d\n\nFor Bassett, his path to becoming a professional musician involved one of these defining life moments. Not too long ago Benny was a lawyer in Chicago, Illinois. After several years playing music in the Chicago scene, he found himself as the co-leader of a Chicago band called Vintage Blue. They found some success in commercial radio, and on the summer festival scene, playing various Chicago street festivals, and two slots at Milwaukee\u2019s Summerfest; but he wanted more. Between 2015 and 2016, the band split, Benny turned his back on the legal profession, and he launched his solo career with his first EP \u201cThese Dreams\u201d. Now, through this new album, Benny is refusing to let this new opportunity pass without speaking up.\n\nFor two and half years, Benny has pursued the journey of a solo troubadour, logging over 200,000 miles, and close to 500 shows. While watching the odometer spin, behind the wheel of his tour SUV \u201cSally the Saturn\u201d, Benny has had his fair share of missed opportunities, moments that escaped, and yes, mistakes. But that same pursuit, also brought him the inspiration for this collection of songs, which includes performances from Travis McNabb (Sugarland, Better Than Ezra) on drums, Kit Karlson (Stephen Kellogg & The Sixers) on keyboard, piano, organ, and Chip Johnson (Alternate Routes) on bass and guitar. The album was constructed, recorded, and produced by Karlson and Johnson at their studio in Gainesville, Virginia, called Alpine Red Studios.\n\nThe six song EP is set to debut in Spring of 2019, and will be accompanied by a lengthy international tour, that is currently set to include performances across the United States, North America, and Europe.

Formed several years ago by twins Roger and Logan Raskin, the union originally began as a mere writing project for producer Greg Ladany. But after several demos were cut and the brothers realized they were on to something, it became a permanent proposition, and the Raskins were born.\n\nAnd while seemingly the majority of today's chart toppers are sonically one-dimensional, the Raskins are a throwback to the days of when bands weren't as confined stylistically. Case in point, the bros list such wide-ranging artists as Kiss, the Buzzcocks, Jim Croce, the Temptations, Mel Torme, and Jane's Addiction as influences. As a result, the \"rock/retro/alternative/pop-rock/singer-songwriter\" tag that the Raskins like to go by is indeed well fitting.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, and fans will be able to experience the Raskins on a pair of nearby speakers soon, as the duo's self-titled debut album was just released, while the leadoff single, \"We Had It All,\" dropped during their Spring tour with Scot Weiland. Songs such as \"We Had It All,\" \"Need Another Hero,\" and \"The Radio Song\" show the retro rock side of the band, while songs like \"Open Our Eyes,\" \"Reach,\" and \"Where Do We Go From Here\" show the diversity of the band's songwriting with acoustic type pop rock ballads.\n\n\"The first radio single and video we decided to go with was 'We Had It All',\" explains Roger. \"This song definitely shows a sound of the band which is most consistent with our biggest rock influences as well as the song being written with a specific topic in mind.\" And according to Logan, a follow-up single has already been selected. \"The second single will be 'The Radio Song,' which is a simple story written about a group of guys grinding with their band on the road - this being us - then all of a sudden, they hear their song on the radio for the first time and how that suddenly changes everything for them, mostly emotionally. We always wanted to write a song about that - most musicians can relate as well as most fans understanding that crucial emotion every musician yearns for.\"\n\nAs for the Raskins' plans once the album is released, it is a simple one, according to Roger. \"Clearly the future plans for the Raskins is to tour as much as possible, and bring our music to every city in the US, as well as all the local radio stations, doing promotional giveaways, rock shows, and signings for all our fans. We want to show the public that we our very accessible. Also eventually heading over to Europe to give our expanded fan base the opportunity to experience the Raskins live. The Europeans love them some rock n roll. Can't wait to share our music with all of them!\"\n\nLastly, Logan unveils that both the music and the bond of brotherhood will prevail for the Raskins. \"We work and strive extremely hard for success with our music. Through all the ups and downs, the trials and tribulations, the acceptances and denials. We always have each other. That is the main focus of the Raskins. We are doing music because we love it and it's our passion. For us we feel we have already had major success because we are doing what we love most in the world to do - write and perform our music for the world to see.\"Thus helping set the standard for the Raskins and continuing on this wonderful musical journey and allowing the world to enjoy all our music.\nWe love you all\n\nFor further information go to www.TheRaskins.com", "otherInfo": "The Raskins \"Rise Again\" North Amercian Tour hits\nSofar Sounds\nSan Francisco, CA\nHAIGHT\nSpecial Afternoon Show\nShowtime 3:30-6pm\nAll ages welcome"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Paige Clem", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8528377.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Rnb-soul, Americana, Roots, Jambands, Folk-soul, Funk, Folk, R&b, R&b/soul", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "Perhaps it\u2019s the combination of her insatiable musical curiosity and her formative years spent growing up in the South, but Paige Clem\u2019s arrestingly direct lyrics and velvety, unaffected vocals exude that most elusive of musical qualities \u2014 Soul.

The album cover was shot in the tropical gardens of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park and it featured a huge gorilla standing front and center. The band, David Jenkins (guitars & vocals), Cory Lerios (keyboards & vocals), Steve Price (drums) & Bud Cockrell (bass & vocals) was nowhere in sight.\n\nAt that point there was a bit of a mystique as to who Pablo Cruise really was. When asked, \u201cwho\u2019s Pablo,\u201d the band, which is a quartet, would answer, \u201che\u2019s the guy in the middle.\u201d When asked what Pablo Cruise meant, the well-rehearsed answer went something like this,\u201dPablo,represents an honest, real, down to earth individual; and Cruise, depicts his fun loving, easy going attitude towards life.\u201d In essence that\u2019s what Pablo Cruise\u2019s music is all about. Honest, real, down to earth vocals, accompanied by fun yet elegant, infectious grooves. To hear Pablo Cruise on record is one thing, but to experience the band live is an exhilarating event.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1985 the band toured the United States, Canada and Japan extensively, welcoming fans to \u201cClimb Aboard The Good Ship Pablo Cruise.\u201d Reaching the top of the charts with mega hits like \u201cWhatcha Gonna Do (When She Says Goodbye),\u201d \u201cLove Will Find A Way,\u201d \"Cool Love,\" \"Dont Want To Live Without It\" and many more, the band went on to sell several million albums and singles collectively and established themselves as well respected writers and performers within the industry. They appeared on numerous TV shows, including Dick Clark\u2019s American Bandstand, The Merv Griffin Show and in 1979 they broke Elvis Presley\u2019s attendance record at The Sahara Tahoe in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, becoming the first rock band to play a Casino Showroom. They also became the first rock band to grace the stage of the Grand Ole Opry, but by 1986 after completing several national tours and releasing 7 albums in all, the band seemed to have lost its focus and just stopped. It seemed like Pablo needed some time to think. Cory Lerios and David Jenkins the bands\u2019 principal songwriters, along with Steve Price decided to take a hiatus. A hiatus that lasted more than 20 years\u2026\n\nThroughout the late eighties, original vocalist David Jenkins continued touring and garnered acclaim in the country markets with the slightly ahead of their time country-rock band Southern Pacific. As they racked up hits like \u201cMidnight Highway,\u201d the chart topper \u201cNew Shade Of Blue\u201d and \u201cHoney I Dare You\u201d (co-written by Jenkins) the band toured all over the U.S. In 1992 Dave connected with Hawaii\u2019s native son, Kapono Beamer, and in \u201995 the duo released the album \u201cCruisin\u2019 On Hawaiian Time,\u201d that became a critics\u2019 favorite as well as being nominated for Hawaii\u2019s prestigious Hoku Award for \u201cAlbum Of The Year.\u201d Since \u201999 Jenkins has joined forces with the composite group, Rock & Pop Masters, that includes some of the great singers of the \u201970\u2032s and \u201980\u2032s. In May of 2011, Dave traveled to Iraq to perform for the troops with Bobby Kimball (toto), and Bill Champlin (Chicago)\u2026..The troops really appreciated them being there in that hostile place to play for them.\n\nPianist and Vocalist Cory Lerios decided to turn his writing and producing abilities to Film and Television. In 1986 Lerios landed his first network series, scoring ABC\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cMax Headroom.\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201cO\u2019Hara\u201d and \u201cPolice Story\u201d immediately followed. Writing to \u201cpicture\u201d became Cory\u2019s newfound passion and in 1989, Cory and partner John D\u2019Andrea landed the theme and underscore for NBC\u2019s \u201cBaywatch.\u201d Scoring 11 seasons of \u201cBaywatch,\u201d garnering several Emmy Nominations, Cory won the coveted award in 1998 for his participation in the music direction of \u201cDays Of Our Lives.\u201d In the new millennium Cory has scored several animated shows including Disney\u2019s \u201cKim Possible\u201d and Universal\u2019s \u201cLand Before Time\u201d.

The cocktail still these days is known as the Manhattan.\n\nThis is a multi-part story of one of the greatest and best-loved groups in the history of soul music, the Manhattans, told by its present end ex-members and many other music business figures, who have been dealing with the group throughout the years. As to the origin of the name of the group, there have been different recollections. One member is in favour of the skyline they could see right across the water from the Jersey City - \u201cManhattan was close to New Jersey. It was easy to remember, and we just felt we wanted to represent class\u201d \u2013 but another member, Mr. Winfred \u201cBlue\u201d Lovett, remembers slightly differently: \u201cWe collectively came up with the Manhattans, but we referred ourselves to the alcoholic drink. Everybody thought the name was from the borough of the New York anyway, so we just grabbed on to that.\u201d\n\n(The pic courtesy of Mrs. Jeanie Scott)\n\nThe five singers, who became the first members of the Manhattans in the early 60s, went to two Jersey City high schools in the 50s - George Smith and Richard Taylor to Snyder High and Winfred Lovett, Kenneth Kelly and Edward Bivins to Lincoln High.\n\n(Sonny Bivins pic taken from www.themanhattans.net)\nEDWARD \u201cSONNY\u201d BIVINS\n\nEdward Jesse Bivins, Jr. (tenor) is the senior member of the group in terms of his age, as he was born on January 15 in 1936. Still today he\u2019s best known as \u201cSonny\u201d - \u201cwhen I was young, I was always smiling\u201d \u2013 but his other nickname used to be \u201cDip.\u201d Sonny: \u201cI played baseball. Then I started singing, and I couldn\u2019t sing and play baseball at the same time.\u201d He played minor league baseball in the Jersey City All-Stars.\n\nSonny was born in Macon, Georgia, to Willie and Edward Bivins. \u201cMy father tap-danced, and I got into music through my father.\u201d Sonny had two brothers, Donald and James, but no sisters. In Macon he started singing in a school choir and glee club. \u201cWe moved no New Jersey in 1950, and I went to Lincoln High in 1951. In school I was two years ahead of Kenny Kelly and Blue Lovett, and we all used to sing around school and on the street corners.\u201d\n\nSonny\u2019s early idol was Sam Cooke, and of the later acts he puts the Temptations first, but thinks highly of the Dells, the Spinners, the O\u2019Jays and B.B. King, too. His all-time favourite record is To Each His Own by Nat King Cole. He has five children \u2013 Mark, Pam, Doug, Yvette and Kenny \u2013 but they\u2019re not active in music. \u201cThey have their own things they wanted to do in life.\u201d\n\n(On the right: Early Smitty; The pic courtesy of Mrs. Jeanie Scott)\n\nSonny reminisces how he met their future lead singer, George Smith, for the first time during a teen dance night at the YMCA in 1953 in Jersey City. \u201cI heard somebody playing the piano in the adjacent room from the dance hall. Slowly I opened the door and peeked my head inside and saw a young, teenage guy about my age playing the piano and singing I Cried in my Mother\u2019s Arms. I walked over to him and started to harmonize with him. We looked at each other, smiled and we introduced ourselves. His name was George \u201cSmitty\u201d Smith. As time went on, our relationship grew closer and we eventually left high school and went into the military vowing to complete our high school education once we got out of the service.\u201d\n\nIn 1954 Sonny joined the NG. \u201cAfter the National Guard, I was in the Air Force in Germany till 1957.\u201d\n\n(Smitty at the Apollo; The pic courtesy of Mrs. Jeanie Scott)\n\nGEORGE \u201cSMITTY\u201d SMITH\n\nThe second oldest in the first line-up of the Manhattans is George Hoza Smith (tenor), who was born in Florida on December 18 in 1939. Jeanie Scott: \u201cHis mother couldn\u2019t remember his actual birth date. It was either supposed to be December the 18th, or December the 28th.\u201d Mrs. Jeanie Scott, formerly McCarthy, who today is the wife of the legendary Jimmy Scott and handles his business (www.jimmyscottofficialwebsite.org ), lived with Smitty until his untimely passing in December 1970. \u201cWe got together in 1969, so I was with him maybe a year and a half.\u201d\n\n(On the right: Jimmy Scott, The pic courtesy of Mrs. Jeanie Scott)\n\n\u201cWhen Smitty was a toddler, perhaps four years old, his mother and his father separated. The only thing he could remember about his father is him walking with some dogs (laughing). His mother moved to Jersey City with Smitty and his oldest sister Marion. Marion has lived her whole adult life in California. Eventually his mother married another man, whose last name was Smith, and he became Smitty\u2019s stepfather, and that\u2019s how he got his name. Smitty\u2019s mother had ten children. After Marion and Smitty \u2013 who they all called \u2018Brother\u2019 \u2013 she had eight other children, so Smitty had three half brothers and five half sisters. Tommy was Smitty\u2019s youngest brother and he had a group called 8 Mile High. The other brothers, Bobby and Joe, had a group of their own, too, Out of Limits.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmitty had three children. When Smitty was fifteen years old, his girlfriend got pregnant with George, Jr., aka \u2018Dewberry\u2019, so they got married. George, Jr. looked exactly like him. After he came back from the service, she had another baby while he was away, Michelle, which Smitty took as his own. Later he had his daughter Paula with a girlfriend.\u201d\n\nThrough his mother, Smitty first sang gospel music in church and then joined his newly-found singing pals, while in Snyder High. \u201cSmitty and Sonny were close at the time, Blue and Kenny were close\u201d. After Snyder High, Smitty joined the Air Force and was stationed in California for two years.\n\n(Smitty & Jeanie; The pic courtesy of Mrs. Jeanie Scott)\n\nJeanie: \u201cMy first memory of the Manhattans would be hearing their records on the radio - I\u2019m the one that Love Forgot, Searchin\u2019 for my Baby... I had been going to all their shows and I kind of had a crush on Smitty, but I was afraid to talk to him. I had seen him around, and I was peeking around corners at him. Eugene Pitt of the Jive Five would tease me and say \u2018go on and knock on their dressing room door and talk to Smitty\u2019, but I wouldn\u2019t go over there. It wasn\u2019t until a couple of years later. They were about to do a show at the Cheetah in New York on 52nd street. I sent Smitty a message and he called me up and he came over to my house the next day. We got together, and we were together ever since, and he moved me in his mother\u2019s house until he passed. As a matter of fact, I stayed with her for a couple of years after that and I remained close to the family throughout the years, especially with Smitty's Mother, brother Bobby - who was like a brother - and Smitty's children George, Jr., & Paula.\u201d\n\n\nWINFRED \u201cBLUE \u201cLOVETT\n\nWinfred Lorenzo Lovett (bass) was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on November 16 in 1940 to Lovonia and William Lovett. \u201cMy father was a singer in church, and he made it mandatory that I sing in church on every Sunday also.\u201d Winfred has two sisters, Billie and Gwendolyn, and today he resides in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nMost know this bass singer extraordinaire best under the simple moniker of \u201cBlue.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my so-called nick-name. If you hung out on streets - and you\u2019re not necessarily bad or are in gangs and nothing like that - you had a nick-name, and because of my complexion and a long hair and a beard \u201cBlue Jesus\u201d was my name. I naturally dropped the \u2019Jesus\u2019 and kept the \u2018Blue\u2019.\u201d During his high-school years he was also called \u201cBacon\u201d for a short while.\n\nBlue has seven children: William, Robyn, Tania, Kia, Damon, Marisa and Rico. \u201cNone of them do anything professionally in music, except Rico, who was born in 1986 and who does rapping. All my kids live on the west coast.\u201d\n\nSome of Blue\u2019s favourite recordings of all times include Neither One of Us by Gladys Knight & the Pips and Sexual Healing by Marvin Gaye. \u201cAlso Luther Vandross has come up with some magnificent songs that I like. I think my all-time bass singer would be Melvin Franklin of the Temptations. The Temptations started us off. We patterned us after the Temptations and Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions.\u201d\n\nIn Lincoln High, Blue played football and baseball. \u201cThen I couldn\u2019t play sports because of my asthma. Baseball was out and football was definitely out, so my third choice was music, and I never thought that I would get an opportunity. If you were from the New York area, it was very hard back then to get a record deal. You had to be discovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did locally high school groups, but nothing ever happened. We just sang to entertain our families, fans, girlfriends... In Lincoln high school Sonny, Kelly and I took part in a singing contest in a variety show and we won. I forgot the name of our group in high school.\u201d All five Manhattans boys got to know each other already in the 50s. \u201cAll five of us met during the high school days. Sonny Bivins, Kenneth Kelly and myself went to Lincoln, and Richard Taylor and George Smith went to Snyder, which were competing high schools in Jersey City.\u201d\n\nIn the late 50s Blue was drafted. \u201cI was in the Air Force. I was in France, but they closed that base and I was transferred to Wiesbaden, Germany. I was discharged in 1960...\u201961. There in Germany I had a group of my own called the Statesmen. It was me and four other guys, but not Sonny and Richard. They were stationed in the Air Force in Germany, too, but they were stationed elsewhere.\u201d\n\nKENNETH \u201cWALLY\u201d KELLY\n\nKenneth Bernard Kelly (tenor) was born on January 9 in 1941 in Jersey City to Eloise and Lloyd Kelly. Kenny: \u201cMy parents are both deceased. My mother belonged to a chorus, when she was younger. She sang in a church choir.\u201d Besides one brother, Adonis, Kenny has three step-brothers and a sister. His two children are called Kai and Monee.\n\nKenny\u2019s last name is spelt both Kelley, and Kelly. \u201cMy father spelt his last name Kelly. There happened a vocabulary error somewhere along the line, and my last name got changed to Kelley. As I grew older, according to certain situations I ran in and out of, they assumed it was supposed to be spelt Kelley. I didn\u2019t go through the corrections, so there exist two spellings of my last name. Most of my IDs have Kelly, so I mostly use Kelly.\u201d\n\nKenny\u2019s nickname is Wally. \u201cWe had a guitar player named Charles Reed and he gave it to me, because I was always telling people different little things and answering to their questions.\u201d Kenny is the only college graduate among the members of the group, and he graduated from Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1963.\n\n\u201cBeing in a group situation, we idolized a lot of groups \u2013 the Spaniels, and later the Temptations and Smokey & the Miracles. Later I had one idol and that was Ray Charles.\u201d Kenny\u2019s favourite record is Letter Full of Tears by Gladys Knight & the Pips, and besides singing he plays piano, trumpet and baritone sax.\n\n\u201cI played in a high school band in Jersey City. I started messing around with my neighbour next door, which was Sonny. He played guitar. We just started singing together, and he introduced me to some guys, who sang. It was just something we did, because we liked doing it. Group singing was popular at that point of time. We all would cross each other at some point. We formed different groups, and from that we eventually came in contact with each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cSonny belonged to this one group, and he brought me in to hear what the group sounded like. I don\u2019t remember the name of the group, but one member kept missing the rehearsals and I \u2013 having been there so frequently and knowing his parts \u2013 said \u2018okay, I\u2019ll do it\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew up with some of the members of the Manhattans. We met in the 50s. I don\u2019t know what groups Richard came out of and I don\u2019t remember what groups Blue was with. Blue was with several groups. A lot of the groups didn\u2019t stay together. They\u2019d form and break up. One group that I, Sonny, Smitty and somebody else were part of was called the Socialeers. We sang in local clubs and talent shows. That group started breaking up, because people had other commitments.\u201d Right after Lincoln High, Kenny joined the Navy, which was followed by his three-year college period in Baltimore. He would meet the other fellows again in 1963.\n\nTHE DULCETS\n\nOne early incarnation of the Manhattans was as lucky as to even cut a record in 1961. Smitty, Blue, Sonny, Ethel Samuels and Buddy Bell had formed another group and they called themselves the Dulcets. This quintet under a misspelt name of the Dorsets released a single on a New York label called Asnes. The plug side, a slowly and heavily swaying post-doowop, novelty type of a song, was titled Pork Chops (Asnes 101), and in style and interpretation it owes a lot to the Olympics or the Coasters of those days. Blue: \u201cyes, that\u2019s the flavour we had on that.\u201d\n\nSmitty is leading on the song that was written by him, Frennie Brooks and John Brown (mistakenly printed as Bowden on the label). Blue: \u201cI think the owner of Asnes was Frennie Brooks, and those guys, Brooks and Brown, worked at the airport and recorded us. Nobody heard the record \u2013 or perhaps twenty-five people \u2013 but nobody bought it. It didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Sonny: \u201cI was laughing, when we did it... but it was okay.\u201d Backed by an uptempo ditty called Cool It, Pork Chops was re-released four years later in the U.K. on the Sue label (391).\n\nSome of the other artists on the short-lived Asnes label were Ernie Johnson (You Need Love) and a \u201cJamaican doowop\u201d outfit named the Jiving Juniors (Moonlight Lover). Soon after Pork Chops the Dulcets disbanded, so there was no follow-up record. Sonny: \u201cEverybody decided to go their own ways. Ethel and Buddy are still around. I see Buddy every now and then. They are here in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nTHE OTHER MANHATTANS\n\nBlue: \u201cWe had a battle for the name, until I Wanna Be was released. There was another Manhattans, and the union insisted that whoever came out with the first hit they would be able to maintain the name, and I Wanna Be (Your Everything) came out in \u201964 and that was the way we won the name over.\u201d\n\nMusic history knows many groups, who have used the name \u2018Manhattans\u2019. There are Eli & the Manhattans, Ronnie & the Manhattans and several plain Manhattanses. In the 50s and 60s singles by these groups have appeared on such labels as Dootone, King, Big Mack, Boss, Colpix, Ransom, Web, Piney, Enjoy, Golden World, Atlantic and Avanti, but not any of them is by our group. Blue: \u201cFrom \u201961 through \u201964 we tried desperately to get a recording deal, but it was impossible.\u201d\n\nThere was at least one occasion, when they actually entered the studio and were ready for Danny Robinson (Bobby Robinson\u2019s brother) to record them, but nothing came out of it. Blue: \u201cHe never recorded us. He pretended to record us, but he never did anything with us.\u201d\n\nKenny: \u201cI became a Manhattan as a result of the group I was introduced to. The members of that group started also not making the rehearsals. Sonny was part of that group and Smitty was already there. We wanted this group to come together. We already knew who we wanted to have as ideal members. So Sonny brought me in, introduced me to the group and then one of the other members stopped making rehearsals. He was a truck driver. Then they brought Richie in. We had to just get a bass voice, and everybody wanted to see if we could get Blue again. He agreed and that\u2019s how we got together.\u201d\n\n(The pic courtesy of Mrs. Jeanie Scott)\n\nJOE EVANS\n\nMr. Joe Evans is a seasoned musician, to say the least. Throughout decades he has played with a number of jazz, blues and rhythm & blues luminaries, but for the Manhattans he was first and foremost the owner of Carnival Records and the gentleman, who gave them their first record release in 1964.\n\nJoe Evans, Jr, was born in Pensacola, Florida, on October 7 in 1916, so this year he\u2019ll turn ninety-four. He started playing the saxophone in the 1930s in the Ray Shep Band, moved to New York in 1938 and has since played with Jay McShann, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Dizzy Gillespie and Lionel Hampton, to name a few. All this is documented in a fascinating book titled Follow Your Heart (ISBN-13978-0-252-03303-2; University of Illinois Press, http://www.press.uillinois.edu; 180 pages + 22 with photos; 2008), written by Mr. Evans himself and Christopher Brooks. It\u2019s an interesting read and contains many remarkable stories starting from Joe\u2019s early days as a musician. He sheds light on touring the south in the 30s, working with such artists as \u201cMa\u201d Rainey, Billie Holiday, Al Hibbler, Ivory Joe Hunter, Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke, running record companies in the 60s and 70s and life after an active and many-sided career in music.\n\nMr. Evans, who today lives in Richmond, Virginia, was kind enough to talk about the Manhattans, Carnival Records and some other points of his career for this article, too. In the 50s he belonged to the Apollo Theater house band in New York. \u201cIt was very nice. It wasn\u2019t tough. We played five shows a day, and one night a week you played a midnight show. On Wednesday night they had an Amateur Hour. A lot of the stars were discouraged in that show at the Apollo. The audience was very responsive. On Wednesday night, if you weren\u2019t good, they would boo you. They had a guy called Porto Rico, who would come out in different costumes chasing you off the stage, if they didn\u2019t like you. But the audience was very good to you, if they liked you.\u201d\n\nCEE-JAY, TANGERINE, MOTOWN...\n\nIn the late 50s Joe met with Clarence Johnson, and became a partner with him in running a record label. \u201cCee Jay \u2013 that was initials for Clarence Johnson. We called him \u2018Jack Rags\u2019. He\u2019s the man that taught me the record business. He played trombone and had played in several bands. He talked me into going into the record business. He knew it, because he was already in it.\u201d\n\nThe roster at Cee Jay in 1960 and 1961 included Mike & the Utopians, Sherman Williams, Jay Dee Bryant & the Magic Knights, Little Roy Little, the Four Kings, Jimmy Spruill & his Band, the Vines, Delroy Green & the Cool Gents and Harry Lewis & his Orchestra... but there wasn\u2019t a hit-making unit. \u201cMost of those artists just gave up. Then some of them continued to try to be a success, but they never made it. A lot of them joined other groups, and some of those groups became famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn that label we mostly did r&b stuff. One big record we had on Cee Jay was a blues record, and it was called I\u2019m a Little Mixed Up by Betty James (583). Leonard Chess of the Chess Records leased it, took it over and made it a big record.\u201d\n\nClarence Johnson passed away in late 1961, the label ceased to exist and Joe proceeded to work for Ray Charles. \u201cIt was very nice. I was working as a promotion director. Ray had a label that was distributed by ABC-Paramount called Tangerine. I did a lot of work coast-to-coast. He was a very nice man, very nice to work with.\u201d Since its start in 1962 Tangerine signed many established artists \u2013 Percy Mayfield, Lula Reed, Louis Jordan etc. \u2013 but hit-wise it wasn\u2019t a very successful company. \u201cI believe that Ray had an idea what was good, but it was not the same idea what was happening in the business at the time. This is just my belief. He could make hits, but other artists that weren\u2019t as strong couldn\u2019t make hits like that. The material wasn\u2019t as strong as his and they weren\u2019t as dynamic as he was. Then he had a band on the road for the people to hear him in person and he could influence people that way. And he was very good at what he did. Other artists couldn\u2019t get away with that.\u201d\n\nAfter Ray, Joe worked for a growing Detroit company called Motown after being approached by another saxophone player and a band leader named Choker Campbell. \u201cI was working and travelling with their show, the Motown Review. I was playing mostly background for the artists, but I did a lot of recording with them, too. I recorded with Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, their girl groups, several artists...\u201d\n\n\nCARNIVAL RECORDS\n\nWith Cee-Jay Records Joe had become so attached to the record business that in conjunction with his work at Tangerine he launched and started running a label of his own called Carnival, a name he picked up from a billboard ad. Joe formed the label in 1962 together with Paul \u201cHucklebuck\u201d Williams, a saxophonist, bandleader and recording artist in his own right that Joe had met in Detroit already in the 40s. They also formed Bright Star Publishing Company (with BMI), and Paul\u2019s home address \u2013 605 West, 156th Street, New York \u2013 became the company and label address.\n\nThe first release, Your Yah-Yah Is Gone (501), was by a girl group called the Tren-Teens, who were scheduled to cut the record already for Cee-Jay. The song owes some to Lee Dorsey\u2019s Ya Ya, released a year earlier on Fury. The Tren-Teens\u2019 debut single was followed by Delores Johnson\u2019s big-voiced r&b belter titled What Kind Of Man Are You, (502). You can listen to some mp3\u2019s at www.westwoodmusicgroup.com -> Carnival Records.\n\nJoe\u2019s and Paul\u2019s Carnival Records shouldn\u2019t be mixed up with Jerry Moss\u2019 and Herb Albert\u2019s label by the same name in 1961, which turned into A&M a year later. Also Atlantic\u2019s Herb Abramson\u2019s Carnival is a different label.\n\nThe third artist for the label was Barbara Brown, who cut in \u201863 a pleading r&b ballad named Send Him to Me (b/w a cute toe-tapper, Sometimes I Wonder), but Barbara\u2019s boyfriend wouldn\u2019t allow her to continue show business career and perform in front of other men, so after one more single a year later she dropped out. She, however, was an important link in Joe and the Manhattans hooking up with each other.\n\nTHE MANHATTANS TO MOTOWN\n\nBarbara told Joe Evans about the group, but there are two slightly different stories as to how the two actually met for the first time. Sonny: \u201cRichard, Smitty, Kenny, Blue and I felt that we had put in enough time and hard work to compete at Harlem\u2019s famous Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night, which was held every Wednesday night. So from Jersey City we went to the Apollo and placed 3rd that night. But as fate would have it, Joe Evans was in the house that night. And despite coming third, we really won that night, because he signed us to his Carnival Record label.\u201d\n\nBlue: \u201cA gentleman called Joe Evans was the one who saw us and liked us. He played alto sax in Choker Campbell\u2019s orchestra that travelled with the Motown acts. Joe Evans\u2019 vision was to start a \u201cMotown\u201d in the New York area, and Barbara Brown was one of his first artists. Barbara told him about us and he caught us at the Apollo.\u201d\n\nJoe: \u201cOne of the artists on Carnival, Barbara Brown, was responsible for me meeting them. She gave them my phone number, they called me and then we set up an appointment at the Theresa Hotel. I had Paul Williams with me. If I saw them earlier, I didn\u2019t remember them, but I never met them in person until they came into the Theresa.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe songs that they sang that day were songs that were made popular by other groups during that time. They sang two or three songs like that. They sang the songs better than the groups that had recorded them (laughing). I said to Paul Williams \u2018that is a million-dollar group\u2019, and he said \u2018oh, you\u2019re crazy\u2019, but later he said \u2018you\u2019re right, you knew what you were talking about\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked them \u2018do you want a record contract\u2019, and they said \u2018yes\u2019, but then they said that \u2018everybody promises to record us but they never get around to it\u2019. Then they told me that they had been approached by Bobby Robinson\u2019s brother, Danny Robinson. He was in the record business also (Everlast, Enjoy). They tell them to come to the record session, but when they get there they\u2019re recording someone else and tell them \u2018we\u2019ll get around to you\u2019, and when they would finish late at night everybody would pack up and go home. They said that happened to them two or three times. I said \u2018well, it won\u2019t happen with me, because if I promise to record you and sign you, I will record you\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next day they signed the contract and brought it back to me. I asked them had they gone over the contract with their parents or friends, they said \u2018no, we don\u2019t need to do that. We\u2019re over twenty-one and speak for ourselves\u2019. So we started from there.\u201d\n\nJoe was still working for Motown, so he took the first two songs he cut on the Manhattans to Detroit first. \u201cI put them on tape and I took the recording to Berry Gordy. He liked it, but he wouldn\u2019t go ahead of Mickey Stevenson. He put him over that, and I would have to talk to him. When I spoke with Mickey Stevenson, he wanted to take it over and only put perhaps my name on a record or something like that. I\u2019ve been in the business too long for that and I wouldn\u2019t go for that, so I didn\u2019t talk to him anymore about them.\u201d Joe soon left Motown altogether.\n\nMUSICIANS, STUDIOS, MIXING...\n\nJoe put the Manhattans on his own Carnival label. For his recording sessions he favoured one particular studio and he used a permanent line-up of rhythm section players. \u201cFor most of the recordings I used Talent Masters in New York, because I worked very well with the engineer there. His name was Bob Gallo, and he was also a guitarist.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the rhythm section I had a regular bunch. There was Bernard Purdie, who was the drummer, and Jimmy Tyrell was the bass player. Robert Banks was the pianist. \u201cSnaggs\u201d Allen was the guitarist and Eric Gale was the other guitarist. They recorded all the Manhattans backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did the mix. I would record the track first. When I record the track, I would let the vocals sing along with it, just to give the musicians the feel of the song. They didn\u2019t have to be good. They were not for the record.\u201d As Mr. Evans tells in the book Follow Your Heart, on four-track tapes that he used those days \u201ctrack one was for the lead singer, two was for the background singers, three was for the rhythm section and the fourth track was for whatever additional instruments were necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I put the strings down \u2013 I think there were five or six of them \u2013 in the mix I would double them up. If I wanted a light sound, I would double them once, and if I wanted something heavier, I would record those five or six in one register and then I make another take of them in another music I wrote. The horns I didn\u2019t double up much. I used the trumpets and I used the trombone most of the time, but I would blend the trombone into the bass sound, and that blend had a different sound to it. When I used the girls in the background, I used the Lovettes, especially with the Manhattans.\u201d\n\nKenny: \u201cWe used Talent Masters Studios in Manhattan. Only studios we used in Jersey City was the rehearsal studios. How many takes we needed? It all depends on the song. Some of the songs we did once, and that was it. We were always told \u2018time was money\u2019. It was no use in going there and not be prepared to go. So we tried to prepare ourselves as much as we possibly could, before we went in.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFOR THE VERY FIRST TIME\u201d\n\nThose two songs that Joe first took to Berry Gordy were finally put out on the first Carnival single (504) by the Manhattans in March 1964. Sonny: \u201cOur first single, For the Very First Time, was a hit locally in the tri-city area.\u201d George Smith, their lead singer, also wrote the song, which is a rather typical dancer of those days and actually sounds like it could have been cut a couple of years earlier. The flip, a mid-tempo and mellow mover titled I\u2019ve Got Everything but You, was written by Joe and his newlywed wife, Anna Moore. Anna took care of the company\u2019s bookkeeping and her sister, Louise, became an assistant in the firm.\n\nPerhaps a local hit, but nationally For the Very First Time didn\u2019t make any waves. According to Joe, their follow-up, There Goes a Fool/Call Somebody Please (506), did a little better. Released in August 1964, There Goes a Fool was written by Sonny. \u201cI had written plenty of songs, but that was the first one recorded.\u201d It\u2019s an uptempo pop song, which undoubtedly was musically influenced by the British invasion those days. Smitty is again leading, and you can even hear a short flute solo by the producer himself, Mr. Joe Evans. Call Somebody Please is a mid-tempo pop ditty, which Blue wrote and he also leads on this side.\n\nThose days Paul Williams decided to leave the company to pursue other interests such as managing artists, so Joe now had the company all to himself. He formed a new publishing company called Sanavan \u2013 the name comes from Anna and Evans \u2013 and the new Carnival address became 350 Chadwick Avenue in Newark, Joe\u2019s home address.\n\nOTHER MERRYMAKERS\n\nAlthough the Manhattans eventually became Carnival\u2019s leading act and breadwinner for the company, many other interesting artists had releases on the label, too. Curly Mayes cut a poppy umptempo ditty called Oh Why (b/w I\u2019m Walkin\u2019 On, Carnival 505) in 1964. Joe: \u201cHe was out west somewhere. I\u2019m still looking for him now, because I have a chance to put one of the songs on his records on a television movie.\u201d\n\nSmitty invited his friend, Curby Goggins, to the company. Curby also cut only one single (Come Home to Daddy/Love Me If You Want to; 510) in 1965. Harry Caldwell sang in his high tenor voice a teenage anguish ballad named Nobody Loves Me on Carnival 516 in 1966. It was backed with another yearning song, this time a mid-pacer titled Nobody Loves Me, co-written by Blue Lovett. Joe: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Harry for years. He\u2019s down in North Carolina somewhere. He was from Charlotte, North Carolina. He was also a brick mason, and he travelled around.\u201d Harry\u2019s second single, a sympathetic \u201chippie\u201d ballad called A New World Is Just Beginning (547), was released as late as in 1970.\n\nThe Lovettes had two single releases and both Little Miss Soul (518 in 1966), and I Need a Guy (530 in 1967) were written by Blue. Blue: \u201cThey lived in Jersey City. We all grew up together wanting to be recording artists, and Joe Evans loved them. We used them sometimes as female background singers, and we were looking for that Motown thing that Berry Gordy did. The idea that Joe had was to record these young ladies and hopefully get a hit on them.\u201d Indeed, Little Miss Soul is like a standard Motown scorcher, whereas the flip, Lonely Girl, is a downbeat tender song. I Need a Guy is again a motownish mid-pacer, while I\u2019m Afraid (to Say I Love you) on the flip is a poignant beat-ballad.\n\nNorma Jenkins recorded Blue\u2019s poignant ballad, Need Someone to Love (528; b/w a stomper called Me, Myself and I) in 1967. Blue had invited Norma to Carnival. Blue: \u201cShe was very good.\u201d Male duos were popular throughout the 60s, and one single by Carnival\u2019s own Turner Brothers proved that as singers they were equal to many of their colleagues. I\u2019m the Man For You Baby (535) is an almost deep soul ballad, while My Love Is Yours Tonight is a more mid-tempo mover. Joe: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen them recently. These people are hard to keep up with. They came from someplace down south. They were quite active. They got around.\u201d\n\nKenneth Ruffin stayed at Carnival for one single as well. I\u2019ll Keep Holding On (536) is a pleading soul ballad with a strong support from the horn section, whereas Cry, Cry, Cry is a blues romp. Joe: \u201cKenny was basically a writer, but I recorded him, because some things he sang quite well. I\u2019ve been searching for him, too. He wrote several songs that other artists did.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Too Late and I\u2019m Just Gonna Be Missing You (539 in 1968) by Rene Bailey let you know from the opening bars that here we have one big-voiced blues lady. Joe: \u201cShe lives in upstate New York. I call to Rene all the time. She\u2019s partly retired. She sings on most of the weekends, and she\u2019s teaching the school.\u201d\n\nIn the next part of the story I\u2019ll still feature two other popular Carnival acts \u2013 Phil Terrell and Lee Williams and the Cymbals - more in detail and with comments from the artists themselves. In their roster Carnival also had such familiar names to the fans of genuine soul music as Little Royal, who cut a fine soul ballad titled I Can Tell, and Jimmy Jules, who excelled on an Otis type of a slowie named Nothing Will Ever Change. Both singles were released in \u201967.\n\nLET\u2019S DANCE FIRST...\n\nSo far on all four released Manhattans sides on Carnival Records the songs had been dancers, and we had to wait till the fourth single to hear a ballad. Joe: \u201cUptempo things were easier to get played. If you had a name, they\u2019d play anything, but the best way to get new artists played was play an uptempo record. When you take it to a deejay, they put it on and they don\u2019t listen to the whole song. They listen to the introduction and a little bit and tell you \u2018I\u2019ll play it\u2019. If you have a slow song, they don\u2019t listen enough, no matter what it is. So you had to have a little bit of rhythm to the song for them to give you a break with.\u201d\n\nThe Manhattans\u2019 third Carnival single was also a mover, but it became their first hit and marked the beginning of a remarkable success story. That song as well as the rest of the Carnival period and DeLuxe period will be covered in the second part of the story.", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents The Manhattans ft.

Eight years later, the trio of Alex Hwang (guitar/vocals), Daniel Chae (guitar/vocals) and Sally Kang (keys/vocals) have returned to the name \u2014 this time as the title of their upcoming EP, \u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One,\u201d out in May 2019.\n\nA celebratory effort ushering in a new era for the band, after having recently evolved from a sextet to a trio, \u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One\u201d is about finding hope in transition, discovering your voice in a sea of doubt, and deciding to dance despite sadness. \u201cIt\u2019s learning to trust your own voice regardless of whatever's happening outside of you,\u201d Chae says.\nSince the departure of three founding band members in 2016, Run River North have fought to reclaim their identity and their sound. With that came a reckoning: The trio were steadfast on returning to their roots and rebranding again as Monsters Calling Home as a way to separate themselves from the personnel changes. Instead, the EP\u2019s title \u2014 and the music within it \u2014 became the vehicle to move past the anger and hurt feelings. \u201cHaving to go through three breakups, it was a shitty time,\u201d Hwang says. \u201cI just stopped wanting to write songs that were angry. It\u2019s a good emotion to go through but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re left with that\u2019s not a healthy place to be. The songs on the EP are more representative of how do you find hope and how do you find joy even if you have a right to feel angry. How can you find a reason to dance even when everyone is telling you it\u2019s not the right time to dance?\u201d\n\nNot just an Asian-American band or a group that relies on a set sonic formula, the EP continues to expand upon the band\u2019s prior folk-leaning backbone. On lead single \u201cHands Up,\u201d the band is at their most bombastic. The result of a co-writing collaboration with Hannah Hooper and Christian Zucconi of Grouplove \u2014 the duo\u2019s first of such sessions \u2014 \u201cHands Up\u201d pairs an earworm-y chorus with a front-and-center guitar melody, a second voice among Hwang\u2019s lead bellow. Overall, the group utilizes more drum programming, dreamy synth, and dynamic production \u2014 a more expansive sonic palette.\n\n\u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One\u201d is bookended by brother-sister songs \u201cCasina\u201d and \u201cCasino.\u201d A song with roots in the band\u2019s days as a six-piece, \u201cCasino\u201d was written as the group\u2019s former members began to phase out. A wistful and rustic intro builds into a walloping chorus: \u201cI\u2019m stuck in this casino / not much left for me.\u201d It\u2019s a song which serves as catharsis when reckoning with the forces that hold us down, a song inspired by Hwang\u2019s mother\u2019s cancer diagnosis. \u201cAt the time it was this big middle finger to cancer or anything you felt was giving an absolute statement to people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cCasina,\u201d on the other hand, was borne out of a late-night studio session between Chae, Kang and their producer, Miro Markie. Aiming to re-work \u201cCasino,\u201d \u201cthey handed me a microphone and they were like, \u2018Try singing,\u2019\u201d Kang remembers. Her take on the song\u2019s chorus added an air of whimsy balancing Hwang\u2019s belt. The pair ping-pong verses and lines, creating a push-pull of dizzying tension. \u201cI think this may be the first song that we don\u2019t have a lead vocalist in a song,\u201d Chae says. \u201cWhen Sally wrote her part on this song it was the first time we thought this might be something. That\u2019s the moment I can point to that was really exciting for this EP. It\u2019s a linchpin for this EP.\n\nWith the energy of \u201cCasina\u201d \u2014 and Kang finding her voice \u2014 in mind, Run River North move forward as a true collaborative effort unthwarted by ego and pretense. No longer held back by fear or discontent, Run River North persevered through pain and came out on the other side victorious wearing a newfound confidence. \u201cIt became about who is in the band,\u201d Hwang says, \u201cand now it feels like Sally, Daniel, and me being very comfortable in our own skin.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero West, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "The Manhattans Feat.

That music scared the shit out of me at age 4 or 5, but I couldn\u2019t stop listening to it. It was so powerful, imaginative, and downright fucking cool! I would put it on every chance I had, and I listened to it loudly. To this day, I consider it to be the biggest influence & ultimate music school. It is probably still my favorite music. My father had an organ in the house growing up, located in the uninspiring suburbs of the giant shithole of New York City. I would mess around on the organ all the time, and I learned the notes, etc\u2026 At age 9 I chose to play the trumpet in school. Thank the gods my school had a music program. I feel sorry for people that don\u2019t. I stayed with it into my sophomore year in High School.\n\nCOSMIC SHIFT\nSometime around age TWELVE, I began playing keyboards. I had all kinds of tape recorders, boom boxes, and other music devices hooked up so that I could multitrack (before I knew what the fuck that was), and I would do my own versions of shitty pop songs I heard on the radio, as well as improvise and create sounds. My first pro (Thank you dad for buying it) keyboard was an Ensoniq ESQ-1. A very interesting FM synthesis board made in Pennsylvania USA. I grew up post-analog so I didn\u2019t get to the good shit until later in life. This electronic sound manipulation seemed other-worldly, and I couldn\u2019t get enough. Keyboards would become the apex of my musical journey, and eventually the piano. I\u2019ll get to that.\n\nMAJOR SHIFT\nAt age THIRTEEN I decided I want to play the drums. I begged my mother for some kind of drum set, and she supportively agreed. Thank you to my beautiful mom for seeing value in music, and understanding that some things in life are far more important than the tangible, material, world, left for the dying in loserville. The DRUMS took me into more realms of music than I ever thought possible. I still consider myself a drummer first, and it will always be my first love. Playing drums is an entirely different level of the shed; A spiritual beast of utmost present-moment-existence experience. I discovered so much music. Loud music, with balls. Beautiful, loud music with bravado, intensity, and the sound of my life. All paths lead to making a Rock band. I liked loud, heavy, progressive Rock. I liked metal. I liked so much music. I miss those days of discovery, and enlightenment. Unfortunately, one of the most difficult things to do in this life is form & keep a Rock band. Or any band, for that matter!\n\nTHE JAZZ\nAfter practicing my ass off on the drums for some years, I found myself attracted to the sophisticated styles of Jazz. This turned into a decade long journey of intense listening and study. Now in my late teens, (Most went off to college to party and fuck around on their parents\u2019 dime), I was working many different shit jobs, renting shitty rooms in different houses, and quickly realizing that my days of drumming were numbered. I had no place to play, and the police started showing up due to noise complaints. My life at that time wasn\u2019t working with drums. I stuck it out until my early twenties. So many Jazz records were now in my head, along with Glenn Gould, and a shit ton of Classical recordings. The piano was becoming a primary source of listening enjoyment. Goddamn, Gould, Monk, Evans! Shit was so good. Shit was deep. I couldn\u2019t get enough.\n\nTHE PIANO\nWhile living in a rather large room somewhere in West Nyack NY, I inherited a piano from my boss at a bookstore I was working at. I spent a year teaching myself (like a fucking baby in nursery school) to play this magnificent beast. Quickly realizing I would need some help to speed the process up, I began seeking out private lessons. Fortunately, I connected with a few amazing humans that were willing to take on a guy in his twenties with dreams of becoming a professional piano player. Keep in mind, that most people around me thought I was mad, and suggested I pursue other paths. \u201cYou need to start when you\u2019re 8 years old\u201d. I really didn\u2019t give a shit what anyone had to say. So, I pursued the piano then enrolled in conservatory. Fuck it, might as well go for it. The main reason for going to music school was to gain access to real pianos, and real practice time. At the ripe old age of 28 I entered music school. I busted my ass, and became a pro piano player. I played thousands of gigs from the shittiest to pretty shitty. I refused to kiss ass, and pursued my own music. I composed a shit ton, and was always most at home in the trio setting. I got so deep into the piano, the history, and the instrument. A mechanical marvel of the industrial revolution. With 12,000 moving parts, a rich history, and solo sound like no other, I can\u2019t help but continue to try to figure out the puzzle known as the piano\u2026\n\nTHE TRIO IS THE GREATEST MUSIC ENSEMBLE AS THE INTERACTION NEVER STOPS. NO ONE HAS A SUPPORTING ROLE & EVERYONE HAS A SUPPORTING ROLE.\n\nTHE BASS & BEYOND\nSometime in my early thirties I got out of the Jazz bubble, and went back to enjoying all kinds of music again. Back to my Rock roots. Back to my classical roots. Back to my ethnic roots. Whatever the fuck you want to call it \u2013 I don\u2019t care. My relentless pursuit of music damn near ruined my life. It destroyed my personal life, but that is all part of the sacrifice as a result of the choices one makes. I stopped playing music entirely for a few years to pursue some other interests. Needless to say, I returned to music. A few years ago I decided to start playing electric bass. I had played a little off and on over the years, but I was really longing for a new shed. I got so into it. I\u2019ve been shedding like a motherfucker, and trying to make myself worthy of the title bass player. It\u2019s been a fascinating part of the journey. I\u2019ve gotten in to setting up, repairing, and modifying basses and guitars. I went down the Leo Fender historical rabbit hole. And as always, I\u2019m glad I did. I\u2019m playing in loud ass bands again. Mostly on the professional level. I\u2019m touring again. All made possible by playing the bass.\n\nLet\u2019s see where this all goes before I\u2019m in the grave. I wish you good luck in your own endeavors, creative or otherwise. May grace and elegance be present in your life. It\u2019s certainly needed in this world of disgusting rotten stinking filth\u2026", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "7 Claude Ln, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Fort Vine", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9161944.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4043, 37.7898], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Indie Rock, Indie Pop, Art Rock, Indie Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Claude", "moreBioInfo": "Fort Vine is an uplifting indie-folk duo named after a secret tree fort in Manhattan, built by songwriting couple, Trevor Tunison and Nyna Nelson.

Frontman Ryan Young thinks so, anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first record I\u2019ve ever made that I like,\u201d laughs Young. \u201cBecause there was no reason to make it anything other than what I wanted it to be.\u201d\n\nThe band has been relatively quiet over the last few years, largely because Young was tending to an ill family member who ultimately passed away last year. But through mourning came inspiration.\n\n\u201cShe was a photographer, and at the wake were all these photos she took,\u201d he remembers. One of those photos struck him immediately. It shows a Mennonite family enjoying a sunny day at the beach while an ominous cooling tower looms in the background. \u201cI said: That\u2019s gonna be the cover of the album that doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d\n\nThat photo captures the spirit of Be Good. While all of Off With Their Heads\u2019 previous work shares a common thread of being rooted in Young\u2019s fatalistic view of the world, Be Good at least allows a tiny glimmer of hope to peek through.\n\n\u201cAll the other records were about moping around and feeling sorry for yourself,\u201d says Young. \u201cThis one is less about feeling sorry for yourself and more about accepting how goddamn miserable you are.\u201d\n\nForced acceptance is big theme of Be Good, though it\u2019s a hard-learned one, often emerging in the form of primal screams in the band\u2019s trademark style of gruff-punk. \u201cHands up to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs, til the floor falls out!\u201d Young yells on the title track, sounding somewhere between motivational speaker and hard-nosed therapist.\n\nMuch of the self-deprecation that defined the band\u2019s previous work has been adjusted. It was the years spent out of the van, developing a life at home in Chicago, that gave Young his newfound, slightly more positive perspective. \u201cNot being on the road 250 days a year, actually trying to develop some sort of life outside of playing shows and drinking, you\u2019d be surprised what that does,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a bunch of weight, I\u2019ve been going to a gym every day, trying not to kill myself all the time.\u201d\n\nYoung and the band members\u2014bassist Robbie Smartwood, guitarist John Polydoros, and new drummer Kyle Manning\u2014holed up for two and a half weeks at Pachyderm Studios, a mid-century mansion in Minnesota where Nirvana recorded In Utero, to make Be Good. Young produced the record himself, and it was the first time he enjoyed the process, or at least tolerated it. \u201cI don\u2019t like how the old records sound, and I hate recording so much,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could just hear all the dumb shit on them where I was like, whatever, just let it go, I want to get out of here.\u201d\n\nBe Good will be released by Epitaph Records on August 16 and, if ever there was a time for Ryan Young\u2019s distinct brand on cautious optimism, it\u2019s now. \u201cThe title is an answer to that question of what you\u2019re supposed to do now that the world is so awful and the climate of this stupid country is so shitty,\u201d he says. \u201cBe good, be loud\u2014that\u2019s sometimes all you can do, I guess, as cheesy as that sounds.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Off With Their Heads"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Rae Solomon Fanpage", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9492492.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Off stage Rae Solomon may be known as Seattle's country darling, but, make no mistake, the moment she steps into the spotlight her high energy sass leaves her audiences begging for more.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Jordan Sherman", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7853172.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Rock, Soul, RnB", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Jordan Sherman is a multi-instrumentalist/vocalist currently residing in Los Angeles, CA.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2209 Broadway St, Redwood City, CA 94063-1641", "Artist": "G\u00fcliz Ayla", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.2293, 37.48637], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "CLUB FOX", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "G\u00fcliz Ayla"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Bib", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "with Bib, Diztort, Odd Man Out, Ash 2 Ash Dust 2 Dust"}, {"Address": "1807 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Steve Hackett", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8671604.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Progressive Rock, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Fox Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Steve Hackett Performing England By The Pound (in its entirety) & Spectral Mornings"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Odd Man Out", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Pop Punk, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "with Bib, Diztort, Odd Man Out, Ash 2 Ash Dust 2 Dust"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "George Cole", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8682442.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Sun Oct 20 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-20", "Genre": "Genres: Guitar Virtuoso, Acoustic, American Song, Composer Songbook, Acoustic Guitar, Performer, Consumate Entertainer, Gypsy Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "GEORGE COLE: Singer and breakneck acoustic guitarist George Cole inhabits a musical world all his own.... a world in which Django Reinhardt, The Ramones, Nat King Cole and Doc Watson get equal billing with Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Willie Nelson and the Great American Songbook.

Originally from West Marin County, he made his way down the California coast through Santa Cruz, writing songs, jamming in garages and performing at every open mic he could find while simultaneously earning a BA in Film & Digital Media and Literature from the University of California Santa Cruz.\n\nHe then immediately moved to Los Angeles where he wrote and arranged his acoustic-laced debut studio album, Californicana. The album was produced by LA producer Marc Danzeisen (Riverdogs, Powerslide, Gilby Clarke), and features saxophonist Jeremy Trezona (Saint Motel), as well as guitarists Johnny Hawthorn (Toad The Wet Sprocket, Everclear) and Manny Alvarez (Jackson Browne, Lucinda Williams), among others.

His first solo effort has been incredibly well-received by Indie, Rock and Americana radio stations nationwide, and won an award for best love song on the Jango Radio 2015 Valentine's Day Playlist, who call it, \"a refreshing roots rock record for the 21st Century\".\n\nAfter a hard-fought six years in the Los Angeles music scene, Frankie returned to his native San Francisco Bay Area in 2016, where his new band has quickly begun to make a name for themselves in the North Bay for their explosive, jam-oriented live shows, and their melodic roots-rock music that bridges eras of influence. Featuring drummer Jeff Nassi (Meredith Brooks, Fillmore Slim, Unauthorized Rolling Stones), guitarist Sunil Sharma (Alison Harris, Reality Check, Blusion), and bassist Matt Pasquale (Gravity Hill), Bourne\u2019s new band is his primary focus of late.

With a lyrical arc rooted in science-fiction yet uncomfortably encroaching upon the reality of the present, the record captures the Fort Collins, Colorado natives at their most ambitious and accomplished, pushing the boundaries even further than on their three previous critically acclaimed full-lengths. \"With this record we're bringing ideas to the table that corroborate the fact that at this juncture, robotics as a field is moving forward at an alarming rate,\" explains vocalist Riley McShane. \"This story is dotted with examples of real-life scientific advancements, and it is also perforated with details of humanity's flaws. Overall, the record tells a story that is still a bit too far fetched to be based in reality, but isn't too far beyond the scope of imagination to see occurring within the not-so-distant future.\" The title of the record encapsulates this, yet there is a dichotomy that is integral to the story. \"On one hand there's the stance of 'I'm a proponent for sentience to help the human race',\" explains guitarist Greg Burgess. \"On the other hand it's a misanthropic statement - 'I'm a proponent for sentience, so machines will recognize the vastly negative impact of humanity and wipe us off the planet.'\"\n\nSuch grandiose and intricate thematic material requires a suitably grandiose and intricate soundtrack, and the band - rounded out by guitarist Michael Stancel, bassist Corey Archuleta and drummer Brandon Park - pushed themselves harder than they ever have before. Given that this is a band already lauded for their extreme technicality and capacity for writing music of truly epic scale, taking things to the next level is always going to represent a challenge, but one they tackled head on. \"Musically the album evolved as we were writing it,\" explains Burgess. \"Mike and I were definitely a little panicked when it came to following up Elements Of The Infinite (2014), and I think mostly that was due to how busy our tour schedule was. But, that really made us work fast, which ended up working out, because we were much more prepared going into the studio.\" That they have ventured into far more expansive musical territory than previously explored before is evident from the moment the record starts. As \"Proponent For Sentience I - The Conception\" rushes from the speakers the listener is met with a veritable wall of choral vocals that is soon joined by similarly powerful orchestral elements before the guitars, bass and drums come thundering in, bringing to mind Dimmu Borgir at their most monumental while sounding almost impossibly huge. From the start, Burgess envisaged such elements as a strong presence across the album, and he worked with \"silent sixth member\" Joe Ferris to realize these. \"Some of the songs actually started from ideas we wrote for orchestral parts. Sometimes I'll have a skeleton of the orchestral and choral parts and how I want them to flow, and Joe sometimes just improves upon it, in other instances he takes the idea and totally re-imagines it into something truly inspiring.\" The three parts of the title track - \"The Conception\", \"The Algorithm\" and \"The Extermination\" - which Burgess envisaged as a sonata, not only provide the overall framework for the concept but also unite the songs over the course of the record. While these individually and collectively represent the pivotal moments of the story they are also among the most epic and sweeping music unleashed here, yet such elements suffuse each of the tracks, none sounding more sinister than \"Demons Of An Intricate Design\", while \"Terrathaw And The Quake\" captures the band at their most anthemic. At the other end of the sonic spectrum, the record also wields some truly beautiful and sonically understated parts, such as the extended flamenco sections of \"Grey Matter Mechanics - Appasonata Ex Machina\", and throughout, the players were always cognizant of not repeating themselves, maintaining the core Allegaeon sound while always pushing it forward. \"If we do something multiple times on an album we refrain from doing them on the next one,\" says Burgess. \"For example on Formshifter (2012) we had a lot of pedal point moments that we haven't done since. Between Formshifter and Elements Of The Infinite we had a lot of sweep picking themes, so we cut that out on Proponent For Sentience. As for solos, you have your bag of tricks that you constantly try to add to so you have new ideas to play with. Melody in solos is what speaks to me, if you can sing a huge proportion of your solo you've done a good job.\"\n\nPresiding over the music is the mighty voice of McShane, and that his contributions to the record are so commanding is all the more impressive considering that this is his first release with Allegaeon, coming into the fold after vocalist Ezra Haynes stepped down in 2015. While the band auditioned three singers, McShane was always the frontrunner in Burgess' eyes. \"In 2014 around the same time we put out Elements Of The Infinite, his band Son Of Aurelius put out their album Under A Western Sun and I was blown away. They had transcended straight tech death, and added more of a progressive element that was everything I ever wanted to accomplish within Allegaeon. Riley at that point became my favorite modern metal vocalist, so when you've got your favorite guy wanting the gig it's an easy choice.\" To say he brings a formidable range with him is something of an understatement, and his breadth of styles, diversity, and the power with which he imbues everything that leaves his larynx is one of the most electrifying elements of Proponent For Sentience. \"When we're warming up and I hear Riley singing Andrea Bocelli in the next room it's amazing. You ask him, 'hey man, can you put some throat singing on this?' and he replies 'Yeah, no problem', as he does on \"All Hail Science\". Anything we have in our heads Riley can produce, and that is exciting.\" While some bands might feel justifiable hesitance to hand over lyric writing duty to a new member, particularly a band known for their intricate and detailed science-based lyrical concepts, McShane immediately stepped up, connecting with the ideas forwarded by Burgess and running with them. \"Almost every song on the album has some sort of tie-in to the concept,\" the vocalist explains. \"For example, \"Of Mind and Matrix\" is about a machine brain coming to consciousness for the first time and being overwhelmed by the new sensory experience, and as the album moves forward, so do the lyrical themes that tie into the concept. \"Cognitive Computations\" details the philosophical theory of computationalism, which basically states that the human mind can be reduced to a series of computations, thus consciousness is something that can be, one day, recreated. This serves as a conceptual tie-in from the angle that it explains a little bit of the realistic possibilities behind the ideas of advanced artificial intelligence. After that, the song \"The Arbiters\" comes back to the fantastical elements of the concept by speaking from the perspective of an intelligent machine realizing its purpose to destroy humanity with a sense of moral justification. This serves as a lead-in to \"The Extermination\" which is also written from the perspective of an intelligent machine. Even the songs that don't directly tie-in to the concept of artificial intelligence eradicating humanity are about scientific advancements, so they're still attached to the idea of science and human understanding moving forward at an alarming rate.\"\n\nReuniting with Dave Otero (Cattle Decapitation, Cephalic Carnage), who has handled production duties on every Allegaeon full-length except Formshifter, tracking the record was an always rewarding process. \"Dave always just pushes us to be better,\" states Burgess. \"Our relationship has morphed over the years, going from a stance that was almost combative and us being resistant to his input to the point we're now at, where we straight up ask him for it. If he says something from one recording session I try to internalize that critique and remember that while writing.\" In tracking \"Proponent For Sentience - The Extermination\", they also recruited Soilwork singer Bjorn \"Speed\" Strid to lend his instantly recognizable vocals, adding a further dynamic, and guitarist Benjamin Ellis (ex-Bloodshot Dawn) also provides a solo on that song. While this track stands as the album closer, the band decided to also include a cover of the 1982 Rush classic \"Subdivisions\", which was initially intended as a bonus track for the Japanese release but has instead become the album's \"final exclamation point.\" Having planned to cover Deicide's \"When Satan Rules His World\", that the band have a vocalist who can sing opened up their options. \"When Riley said let's cover a prog band, it was like 'now you're talking!' I'm a huge Rush and Yes fan, and I think Brandon jumped at playing Neil Pert. It's a hard thing to arrange Rush and keep the spirit of the original intact, they're like a sacred band, you don't want to mess with it too much. However, we're a metal band so we had to change a few things to make it fit our style, and I think we managed that.\"\n\nWhile achieving all they set out to with Proponent For Sentience, things are already progressing in Allegaeon's world, and album number five is already being gestated, though they plan to hit the road hard before returning to the studio. \"At this point, our main goal is to make it overseas and to start thinking globally, and to be able to tour with bands like Lamb Of God, Soilwork, Scar Symmetry, Slayer, Carcass or Machine Head would be dreams come true,\" Burgess enthuses. \"But, we have also already started writing the next record, and we're very happy with the progress so far. And yes, we have a very epic/big idea that's pretty ambitious, but it all comes down to money and if we'll be allowed to do it!\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "224 Vintage Wy, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "Don Gallardo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9409278.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.55345, 38.088411], "Date": "Mon Oct 21 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-21", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk, Country, Folk Acoustic Rock, Singer song writer, folk, americana, ROOTS MUSIC, Country and Soul, Folk Rock, Singer, Songwriter, Musician, American Folk, American Roots Music, Alt-Country", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Hopmonk Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "ROLLING STONE'S \"10 Artists You Need To Know\" - September 2017\nwww.rollingstone.com/country/lists/10-new-country-artists-you-need-to-know-september-2017-w500707/don-gallardo-w500720\n\n\nDon Gallardo has called Nashville home for over 11 years.

Only through continuing to write and perform together were guitarist Martin Earley, cellist Calin Peters, and drummer Devin Mauch able to fend off their darker days. While the skies may not be completely clear, the path ahead is -- and the trio take their first steps forward today.\n\nThe next phase begins with their new single, \"Only Lonely,\" a track that harnesses the Thieves' handsome harmonies and nimble, sturdy acoustic folk. Though disarmingly warm, the lyrics expose the terrible version of oneself that emerges when an unhealthy mental state gains control. \"I think anyone who has struggled with depression, anxiety, or profound loneliness can identify with the idea that sadness is at once a passenger and a conductor,\" says Earley, \"and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to tell the difference.\"\n\nJust as the Thieves survive on the strength of their reliance on each other, however, the chorus of howls throughout the song remind the listener that we never battle alone. \"Depression can be an isolating maze, but despite the reclusive heaviness of the words in the song we attempt to keep a team mentality when a band mate, partner, or friend is living in the darkness,\" says Peters. \"The band remains and gains strength after the touring years have taken their toll, sometimes howling as one, other times answering the cry of distress, but always relentlessly singing.\"\n\nThat pack mentality pervades all aspects of the upcoming EP from which \"Only Lonely\" stems. It's what pushed Peters to step into the writer's role more than ever, a challenge she admits she may never have undertaken if not for the buoying of Early and Mauch.\n\n\" I feel powerful and proud of myself for trying something new, and also sort of protected and encouraged by the guys,\" she proclaims. They've also rallied a brand new team for this latest outing, with producer Ryan Hadlock joining them for the first time and the support of a new label, Nettwerk Records. \"They believed in what we were doing artistically and they weren't going to try to affect that,\" says Earley. \"That's a really incredible thing to hear from a label, especially one of that size and that reputation.\"\n\nMore details on the EP are forthcoming, but their Nettwerk debut single makes one thing clear: The Ballroom Thieves are stronger together than ever, and they're ready to confront both inner and outer demons with the assurance of a band that's only begun to rise.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Zach Nugent Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7970099.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Mon Oct 21 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "Zach Nugent\u2019s playing is soulful, rootsy and organic, the kind of sound that grows out of the music naturally and effortlessly.

After years of dishonest living\u2014consumed by drugs, alcohol, and addiction\u2014such sincerity is jarring from the 30-year-old Chicago-based musician. Liberated from a self-destructive past and born anew in sobriety, Francis has captured an inspired collection of songs steeped in New Orleans rhythms and Chicago blues. His music evokes a bygone era of R&B\u2019s heyday while simultaneously forging a new path on the musical landscape. Ohio-based Karma Chief Records (a subsidiary of rising soul label Colemine Records) will release two songs, \u201cThese Are The Days\u201d and \u201cChanges, Pt. 1,\u201d in early 2019 with the full LP to follow in summer 2019.\n\nThere is a deep connection between Francis\u2019s childhood\u2014his obsession with boogie woogie piano, his father\u2019s gift of a dusty Dr. John LP\u2014and the songs he\u2019s created. The result is an astonishing collection of material without parallel in the contemporary funk and soul scene. The influences are unmistakable: the vocal stylings of Allen Toussaint and Leon Russell; the second line rhythms of The Meters and Dr. John; the barroom rock \u2018n\u2019 roll of The Rolling Stones; the gospel soul of Billy Preston; the roots music of The Band. Francis pays tribute to the masters but has his own story to tell: \u201cIt\u2019s the life I\u2019ve lived so far.\u201d\n\nAnd what a life it\u2019s been. Born Neal Francis O\u2019Hara, the piano prodigy found himself touring Europe by the age of 18 with Muddy Waters\u2019 son and backing up other prominent blues artists coast-to-coast. In 2012, Francis joined popular instrumental funk band The Heard. With Francis at the creative helm, The Heard transformed into a national act, touring with boogaloo progenitors The New Mastersounds and chart toppers The Revivalists and appearing at Jazz Fest and Bear Creek. As The Heard\u2019s star rose, however, Francis sunk deeper into addiction. Once a promising sideman, by 2015 he had been fired from his band, evicted from his apartment, and was perilously close to self-destruction. \u201cWhen you get close to death like that you can feel it,\u201d Francis recalls. An alcohol-induced seizure that year led to a broken femur, dislocated arm, and, finally, the realization that he needed to get clean.\n\nThe journey from a hospital bed to launching his solo career was neither predictable nor straightforward. There were musical fits and starts, relapses, and broken relationships. Yet the overwhelming passion driving Francis in this second act has been an overabundance of creative energy. \u201cDrinking held my music in a half-cocked slingshot. I was always so consumed by drugs and alcohol that I didn\u2019t have the time, money, or creative energy to do it. Sobriety let it loose.\u201d\n\nDetermined to realize the songs swirling in his head, Francis assembled a crack team of musicians, calling on bassist Mike Starr (The Heard) and drummer PJ Howard (The Revivalists, The Heard). He linked up with producer and analog-obsessive Sergio Rios (Orgone, Cee Lo Green, Alicia Keys) and self-funded a trip to Killion Sound in Los Angeles to record the initial batch of material. \u201cI learned to trust my instincts in that room,\u201d says Francis. Buoyed by classic horn arrangements and Rios\u2019 fierce guitar work, the resulting tracks illuminate a lifetime spent studying the masters of soul music.\n\nFrom the RMI electra-piano riff that kicks off \u201cShe\u2019s A Winner\u201d to the screaming organ swells of \u201cThis Time,\u201d Francis and company let it all hang out. This is fun music, dance music. Yet verse after verse and chorus after chorus, Francis wrestles with his past in a straightforward manner: \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I\u2019m not home/ I\u2019m surrounded by people, but I\u2019m really alone.\u201d Like Toussaint and Russell before him he\u2019s married the upbeat rhythms of New Orleans R&B with the lyrical approach of a confessional singer/songwriter. The refrain on \u201cThis Time\u201d serves as a foxhole prayer for a better future: \u201cLet me get it this time/I won\u2019t let you down/Let me get it this time/I won\u2019t fool around.\u201d\n\n2018 has been a busy year. In February Francis finished recording basic tracks for the yet-to-be named debut album in Los Angeles and spent the following months doing overdubs in Chicago with engineer Mike Novak (who also recorded demos for the project). After playing his first show in November, Francis was signed by Paradigm Talent Agency. He is now preparing to tour relentlessly to promote his own music. \u201cI\u2019m doing this to fulfill a drive within myself, but also to pay tribute to the gifts I\u2019ve been given. And it comes from a place of immense gratitude. I\u2019ve been given so much in my life, especially in the last two years, that this feels like a bonus.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Rich Brian", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9194930.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Mon Oct 21 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-21", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-hop, rap, Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "OnTheSailor, RichBrian is not only feeling the sea change, but motion sickness too.

Same Palace, with a brand new customized flavor. On the shelves and on the road. The surprise breakout band of the last decade, the apostles of Electro Swing and precursors of a laidback yet terribly upbeat trend, is coming up with an evocative second album: Panic! This time, Caravan Palace takes us even farther than their first album (that sold more than 150 000 copies) and continues an amazing adventure almost started by accident. Their strength lies in their common passion for electronic music. Charles, Arnaud and Hughes, the initial trio, dig swing, especially gypsy jazz, and try their hands at the genre\u2019s traditional instruments: guitar, double bass and violin. That\u2019s where this peculiar mixture of classical Django and new trendy electro comes from. And it\u2019s far better than those retro futuristic sounds\u2026 because it swings. A few myspace posts later and they have doubled in size, enrolling Chapi, the boisterous Colotis, and Toustou, from now a member of the band in full-time. They start touring long before they even think about releasing an album. And everything clicks in 2007, during the Django Reinhardt Festival in Samois. Terrified to be part of the gypsy jazz pantheon, they gather speed and steam and create a real posse (not unlike hip-hop) that follows them everywhere. The word is out, their breakout song, Jolie Coquine, is playing everywhere. The record is released a year later, and it\u2019s an immediate hit. They soon tour France and Europe. The show peaks at the Olympia. The room is packed, people go crazy\u2026 listening to swing. This has never happened before. But during the autumn of 2010, they stop and take a month off to start thinking about the new album. How do they come up with new songs? Every member of the band works in his own musical lab before exchanging files at night. The same process starts over the next day. And when the others react instinctively, it\u2019s generally a good sign. The basic rhythm of the first album has mutated into sophisticated beats, less gimmicky, more varied and enriched with sounds flirting with the frontiers of trip-hop. They still love Massive Attack, they still dig the creative minds of Ninja Tune, Isol\u00e9e\u2019s minimal electro vibe or Gorillaz\u2019s grand hip-hop rock bazaar. Only the best of the best. But they also rediscover thirties and forties swing jazz, artists like Fletcher Henderson, or the less mainstream musicians like Charlie Shavers and Mildred Bailey. Six months later, forty-something titles pile up. It\u2019s time to regroup in the studio\u2026 where fifteen vintage keyboards are waiting. Tirelessly, the band tries new things, merges styles and makes creative decisions. Fourteen titles are soon emerging. The petulant voice of Colotis is booming again and the old friend Cyrille-Aim\u00e9e is back on two songs.

He has been featured in Terence Blanchard\u2019s band for the last six years and has appeared on the Grammy Award-winning and nominated recordings, A Tale of God\u2019s Will, and Flow, on which he contributed original compositions and orchestrations. Since arriving in New York City in 2003, Scott has appeared on more than 30 records as a sideman, and on the soundtracks to seven feature films. He is recognized as an endorser by Yamaha Corporation, Remo, Vater, Puresound, Sabian, Protechtor, Craviotto Snare Drums and Danmar Percussion.\n\nHowever, touring the world and recording with the likes of Blanchard, as well as Herbie Hancock, John Scofield, Dianne Reeves, Maria Schneider, Wayne Shorter, Angelique Kidjo, Bilal, Christian McBride, David Sanborn, John Patitucci, The Crusaders, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Robert Glasper, Stefon Harris, Kenny Garrett, Pat Metheny, Nicholas Payton, Patti Austin, Gretchen Parlato, Lionel Loueke, Roy Hargrove, Raul Midon, Taylor Eigsti plus playing on numerous film soundtracks by Spike Lee and other filmmakers, is not nearly enough for the uber-talented 29-year old.\n\nWhile excelling in the business of playing music, Scott decided to plunge head first into the business of running a record label. In preparation for his debut recording as a leader, the drummer discovered the need for himself and other artists to have a new platform from which they could release their music. Scott also had no desire to place the destiny of his first recording in the hands of a traditional record label. In 2007, he launched World Culture Music with the release of Kendrick Scott Oracle \u2013 The Source.\n\nKendrick Scott grew up in a household of musicians and first encountered the drums in church, where his parents and older brother were involved in the music ministry. By age six, Scott\u2019s parents (Stepheny and Kenneth) could see that the young man\u2019s interest in the drums was not a passing fancy, so they set him up with sticks, a pad and lessons. \u201cAs a kid, I remember listening to the music at church and feeling chills in my body. I knew then, that music was my calling.\u201d Years later his hard work, and the great support of his family, enabled Scott to attend Houston\u2019s renowned High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (other graduates include Robert Glasper, Chris Dave, Mike Moreno, Jason Moran, Eric Harland, Beyonce and many others). While a student, he won Downbeat Magazine student awards, plus the Clifford Brown/Stan Getz award, presented by the IAJE and the National Foundation for the Advancement of the Arts. He was later awarded a scholarship to attend Berklee College of Music where he majored in Music Education. \u201cGoing to Berklee was pivotal for my growth as a musician. I met so many great amazing musicians and friends,\u201d he exclaims. As an undergrad, Scott gigged with Pat Metheny, Gary Burton, and Kenny Garrett. Upon graduation, he already had offers from Joe Sample and Terence Blanchard.\n\nThe title track of his debut CD, The Source, was originally recorded on Terence Blanchard's 2005 record, Flow, for Blue Note Records. Flow features Scott as well as pianist and producer Herbie Hancock who plays on Scott's composition. \"Being a part of Terence's group for seven years has been a godsend. He has given the members of the band freedom to grow and cultivate our voices. When we went in to record \u2018The Source\u2019 Herbie said he would play on it; one can only imagine how I felt.\" If that weren't enough, Scott's composition was the Grammy nominated track (for Hancock's solo). \"I knew when I went in to record my record that 'The Source' would be the title track. It's is an homage to humanity. While the world is at unrest, I believe compassion will prevail.\"\nKendrick Scott is one of the bright stars in an amazingly talented group of young drummers on the scene today. He remains a first call player for major artists because his humanity and compassion extends into the notes and phrases he chooses to play, which makes his playing consistently ring true as it springs forth from an ego-less, honest place. These deep roots, connected to his mentors, inspirations, peers, his parents and to the church, enable Scott to be present and in the moment, bringing to the table the wisdom of a veteran musician and the adventurousness of a perpetually curious young artist.\nIn the words of Terence Blanchard, \"Kendrick is a true artist of the highest order. He is not bound by the conventional wisdom of the music world. I've noticed that he never says why, but rather why not. He is exactly what the music world needs: someone with the vision and courage to press forward and expand the world of music. I am blessed to have him around and look forward to seeing what he does every time we play.\u201d", "otherInfo": "KENDRICK SCOTT ORACLE"}, {"Address": "155 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Gaucho", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7519822.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.405592, 37.796778], "Date": "Mon Oct 21 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-21", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Acoustic, Swing", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Comstock Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "Gaucho is a masterful Bay Area band that combines the influence of gypsy jazz of 1930\u2019s Europe with the rhythmic drive and collective improvisation of New Orleans swing music, gutbucket blues and elements of ragtime.

Well, let\u2019s think back 30 years: Would you have thought that a grindcore band from Birmingham would ever make it into the official album charts with some of the most infernal noise ever put on tape, enter the Guinness book for the shortest song ever recorded or appear in a prominent UK TV series named \u201cSkins\u201d? That it would be part of an Alice Cooper hosted episode of BBC\u2019s Never Mind the Buzzcocks to guess from a couple of look-alikes who is the singer in NAPALM DEATH? Could you have ever imagined a down-to-earth lad named Mark \u201cBarney\u201d Greenway, a soccer fan (Aston Villa F.C.), vegetarian, prog metal freak and one of music history\u2019s most renowned representatives of \u201ccookie monster\u201d style vocals would become a personality within the extreme music realm that is not about beer-drinking and hell-raising but synonymous with sounding hard while being smart? Well, that is where we are at now. From filthy, sweaty rehearsal rooms and tiny clubs and pubs NAPALM DEATH has conquered every music festival you can think of and toured through corners of the world a lot of bands would not even dare to tour while becoming famous for combining brutal music with political engagement and ethical values beyond the usual clich\u00e9 of sex, drugs & rock n roll. And, as most fans will be delighted to hear, this remarkable story is far from being over\u2026\n\nFourteen albums in (not counting the cover-platter \u201cLeaders\u2026Part 2\u201d) three decades and NAPALM DEATH remain the leaders of the grindcore / death metal world, once again showing the upstarts how it's done. Not content to simply wear the term \u201clegendary,\u201d the band has once again raised the bar on what it takes to remain at the top of the heap with its highly anticipated new album \u201cUtilitarian\u201d. While their past roster reads like a who's who of extreme metal royalty, including Lee Dorrian (Cathedral), Bill Steer (Carcass), Justin Broadrick (Godflesh) and the late Jesse Pintado (Terrorizer) to name a few, it's the current line-up of Mark \"Barney\" Greenway (vocals), Mitch Harris (guitars), Shane Embury (bass), and Danny Herrera (drums) that has kept the legend alive and seething. \u201cUtilitarian\u201d is the follow-up to the band\u2019s much lauded 2009 album, \u201cTime Waits For No Slave\u201d, and sees the quartet return in expected raw and uncompromising fashion.\n\nIn the wake of a gruelling international tour schedule for \u201cTime Waits For No Slave\u201d, NAPALM DEATH finally got down to writing for \u201cUtilitarian\u201d in early 2011. It was recorded over the course of the year at Parlour Studios in Northamptonshire, UK with producer Russ Russell monitoring the mayhem, finally mixed and mastered in November. The end result is vicious and chaotic, but Greenway notes that \u201cthe ever-present darker, more ambient side of Napalm (references: Swans, My Bloody Valentine, Birthday Party et al) has now gotten faster, too \u2013 or at least the tempo of it varies so it\u2019s not just exclusively slow and mournful. This gives it an extra, obtuse dimension. And hopefully people get lost in the frantic thickness of it.\u201d\n\u201cUtilitarian\u201d runs the gamut from straight-ahead violence and force to pure, undiluted NAPALM DEATH-induced chaos that overall provides a well-rounded bloodletting that's not for the weak and also confronts the listener with such surprising moments as the sax passages by none other than John Zorn on \u2018Everyday Pox\u2019 or choral-like clean sections in \u2018Fall On Their Swords\u2019 or \u2018Blank Look About Face\u2019. The latter is a perfect bridge to the album\u2019s outspoken lyrical content as it viciously attacks politicians\u2019 opportunistic talk that according to Greenway only knows one goal: \u201cSay anything to tame a crowd - whether it is sycophantic praise, bullshit morality or rabble-rousing power-speak - as long as they can cling on to their place in the hierarchy.\u201d\nTrue to the band\u2019s tradition of spitting gallons of verbal venom, \u201cUtilitarian\u201d is an in-your-face razor-edged platter of social, cultural and political commentary. Far from being a placard-waving \u201ccause\u201d band, the quartet offer up personal views on the degeneration of society ('Everyday Pox'), the arms trade ('Fall On Their Swords'), sexual and gender expression (\u2018Gag Reflex\u2019), the environment ('Order Of Magnitude') and aspects of everyday life for the common man ('Collision Course', 'Think Tank Trials') revealing Barney\u2019s understanding of what to do with your life: \u201cWe have a finite period of existence that is all too easy to waste, and ultimately we all deserve happiness and contentment.\u201d The bottom line is: Think for yourself, liberate yourself and don\u2019t end up feeding the machine that all too willingly eats you up.\n\nUltimately, NAPALM DEATH are special because they never sacrificed their ideals for anything mundane, will continue pleasing their fans with a stunning record named \u201cUtilitarian\u201d and ceaseless touring activities in support of its release while provoking world leaders with all the rage and criticism you can squeeze into a song.

With a career spanning 20 years and hundreds of thousands of albums sold worldwide, the band\u2019s highly anticipated new album 'Based On A True Story' will add an exhilarating new chapter to the SICK OF IT ALL legend. Doubtlessly the band\u2019s hardest hitting effort to date, 'Based On A True Story' easily meets the high quality of its predecessor and offers tons of soon-to-be-classic hardcore hymns like 'Dominated', 'Long As She\u2019s Standing', 'The Divide' and 'Lowest Common Denominator. It features the most catchy and powerful material the band has ever written. It\u2019s astonishing to see the band still boiling with rage at a world gone wrong and successfully transforming this natural and honest aggressiveness into hardcore hits. Two decades of experience as skilful songwriters, endless touring, plus an undying hardcore spirit make SICK OF IT ALL anno 2010 sound stronger and more determined than ever. 'Based On A True Story' is undeniable proof that the quartet is simply unstoppable and unrivalled within the hardcore scene in terms of quality and sheer impact. Formed during 1986 in Queens, the band released their first self-titled EP on Revelation Records and began to accumulate a strong local following by playing famous clubs like CBGBs ('A Month Of Sundays' actually pays tribute to these glorious days at this legendary venue). Soon after, the band released their first full-length record 'Blood Sweat And No Tears' on In-Effect Records. Often revolving around politics, social injustices and life on the streets of New York, the band wore their heart on their sleeve and made no apologies, often including threads of positivity. When their second album 'Just Look Around' was released in 1992, it was a benchmark for the band and the New York hardcore scene, and kicked off their globe-trotting expansion with tours in Europe, South America and Japan. They released their breakthrough album 'Scratch The Surface' in 1994 on Atlantic, followed by the seminal album 'Built To Last' in 1997. After releasing three albums on Fat Wreck Chords, as well as a live album and a collection of rarities, the band took on the challenge to push themselves further. 'Death To Tyrants' was the band\u2019s first cooperation with Century Media and was mixed by renowned metal producer Tue Madsen (The Haunted, Heaven Shall Burn, Dark Tranquillity,) adding a refreshingly heavy edge to the band\u2019s trademark NYHC sound. 'Death To Tyrants' was extremely well received by media and fans alike and followed up with three years of relentless touring. The new album was also recorded with Tue Madsen, this time at Starstruck Studios in Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark, resulting in a massive metallic heaviness which increases the punch and drive of the new opus. Craig Ahead (bass) comments: \u201cThe end result of our three and a half weeks in the studio is something that we are all very proud of. An album that is pure SICK OF IT ALL and will stand up against any of our previous work and I believe raises the bar to a new standard. I hope you enjoy our offerings. We look forward to its release so we can again stomp the world. See you on tour!\u201c To walk the talk, the band plays a European tour with Dropkick Murphys in January/February 2010, followed by a UK run with AFI in April. More festival shows and touring activities are in the works. 'Based On A True Story' is another sonic statement that SICK OF IT ALL are an institution of hardcore. Their longevity and conviction has kept the band\u2019s reputation untarnished and legendary. As Metal Hammer (UK) puts it: \u201cSICK OF IT ALL \u2013 despite their ever-increasing age and fierce competition \u2013 are still the finest spokesmen for hardcore\u2019s social conscience and values\u201d, and this new release will allow them to maintain this leading position for many years to come!

Precautionary measures are taken and they - of course - get banished, only this time, it\u2019s into space! When the greedy ship captain hordes the food rations, the crew kicks into survival mode, commit mutiny, and devour their captain skewing the story into a horrific yet fantastic cannibalistic voyage into space that cult movies are made of.\n\nThe Fatal Feast, the fifth studio album by Richmond, Virginia\u2019s speed metal punks MUNICIPAL WASTE, not only ponders the type of moral dilemma faced in the title track but also tackles earthly issues that consistently plague humanity (\u201cCovered In Sick/The Barfer,\u201d \u201cRepossession,\u201d \u201cStandards And Practices,\u201d \u201c12 Step Program,\u201d \u201cCrushing Chest Wound\u201d). These 37 minutes of new music consolidate the best of everything the band\u2019s got to offer: their utmost respect for headbang-inducing riffs, their trademarked aggression, their tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and their talent for extracting meaning out of the absurd.\n\nRising from the squalor of a cursed punk house for their live debut at a New Year\u2019s Eve keg party welcoming in 2001, founding members Ryan Waste and Tony Foresta quickly embraced a DYI ethic to spread the word about their band and graduated to booking shows out-of-state and even in Mexico. After a self-titled EP and the Waste \u2018Em All debut album in 2003, bassist Phil \u201cLandPhil\u201d Hall and former Melt Banana drummer Dave Witte were ushered into the fold. This line-up went on to record three full-length albums for Earache Records (2005\u2019s Hazardous Mutation, 2007\u2019s The Art Of Partying, and 2009\u2019s Massive Aggressive), earning such accolades throughout their career as \u201cMUNICIPAL WASTE do it so well that any track could squeeze comfortably between D.R.I. and Gang Green on a mix tape\u201d from Spin Magazine, \u201cNo band sound more authentic,\u201d from Alternative Press, \u201cA gold standard\u201d from Decibel magazine, and \u201cUndeniably the best at what they do,\u201d from Outburn magazine. Visually, the band also delivered, as evidenced by the success of the devil-may-care and often outrageous attitude of their videos which have all become fan-chanted anthems at their live shows. The fact is, no one could argue against MUNICIPAL WASTE\u2019s reputation as the ultimate feel-good party band.\n\nDedicated to keeping the spirit of the 1980\u2019s cross-over scene alive, it was with their uncontrollable mirth and succinct songs that lead MUNICIPAL WASTE to reap the rewards of their hard work. By the time they signed with new label Nuclear Blast in 2011, they had proven themselves as die-hard road warriors who could tour & perform with bands outside their genre such as Suicidal Tendencies, The Casualties, 7 Seconds, Circle Jerks, Sick Of It All, GWAR, Lamb Of God, Children Of Bodom, and At The Gates and win over their crowds. Here they are 11 years later and their rabid fan base \u2013 which includes fans of metal, punk, and hardcore - continues to expand.\n\nWith artwork by Justin Osbourn of Slasher Design, 2012\u2019s The Fatal Feast is the first MUNICIPAL WASTE album to feature contributions from invited guests. Steve Moore of Zombi penned the intro to the title track and the spacey \u201cWaste In Space,\u201d John Connelly of Nuclear Assault\u2019s vocals grace the album\u2019s title track, and former singer Tim Barry of Richmond punk legends Avail jumps in on \u201cStandards And Practices.\u201d\n\nAptly hailed as \u201can interstellar thrashterpiece\u201d by Decibel magazine, MUNICIPAL WASTE\u2019s The Fatal Feast debuted at #3 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.

That ties everything together.\u201d\n\nThat mood resonates through the title track, a song of hope and heartbreak built around Lewis\u2019s passionate voice, deeply personal storytelling and his familiar, raw brand of acoustic songwriting. He penned it about the seismic change in his life brought on by the success of 2016 debut single \u201cWaves\u201d, after which the songwriter found himself traveling the globe and living out of hotel rooms, to the detriment of his relationship at the time.\n\nThe slow-building, anthemic \u201c7 Minutes\u201d recounts the first few moments after an argument he had with an ex, as the gravity of the situation dawns: \u201cIt\u2019s been half an hour since I dropped you home,\u201d he sings, \u201cand I\u2019m driving past the places we both know, past the bar where we first kissed and that movie that we missed.\u201d\nThroughout that period, during which he toured the world and released his debut EP, 2017\u2019s Same Kind Of Different, Lewis came to gain a better understanding of who he is as an artist.\n\n\u201cThe EP was me throwing things at a wall. I didn\u2019t really know who I was. Now I have a good sense of what\u2019s me,\u201d he states, pointing to three key ingredients that unite his work: \u201cThe way I write lyrics, which is very first person; the acoustic guitar; and the rawness. They\u2019re the three things that tie it all together.\u201d\n\nAs an aspiring songwriter without a record deal, Lewis used to go on night drives where he\u2019d listen to his shoddily recorded demos in the car and visualise where he wanted the songs to end up. Not even in his wildest dreams, however, could he have predicted the trajectory his career has taken since the release of \u201cWaves\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut one thing I\u2019ve learned,\u201d he says, \u201cis that the self-doubt never goes away: \u2018Does my voice sound good? Can I play guitar well enough? Can I sing anymore?\u2019\u201d For a self-styled perfectionist, who in addition to writing every song on the album also played piano and acoustic/electric guitar, perhaps one of the most remarkable things about A Place We Knew is that Lewis is at peace with his creation.\n\n\u201cEvery song on the album I can sit down and push \u2018play\u2019 and just relax and feel confident and know that they\u2019re really good. I know the success of \u2018Be Alright\u2019 might have changed things a little bit, but I think when you release a new song, or an album, you start from zero again and you have to prove yourself.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2001 Gayley Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720", "Artist": "Freya Ridings", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8535172.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.25063, 37.86976], "Date": "Tue Oct 22 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-22", "Genre": "Genres: Singer Songwriter Alternate Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Hearst Greek Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "23 year-old Londoner Freya Ridings released her singles Blackout and Maps (a breathtaking version of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs original song)in 2017.

That\u2019s when he got a phone call from Avishai Cohen (Double Bass player and composer, known for his career both as a sideman for Chick Corea and for his current career as a successful bandleader) and was invited to join the band. Maestro joined Avishai Cohen\u2019s Trio together with drummer Mark Guiliana where he played for 5 years all around the world.\n\nIn 2011, Maestro left Avishai\u2019s group to pursue his own career as a band leader.\n\n\u201cIt was the right time. I felt this bubbling energy inside that led me to continue my road and to take this difficult leap towards becoming a band leader\u201d.\nShai Maestro Trio was formed in July 2010 in Brooklyn after playing at Maestro\u2019s practice studio.\n\nThe trio went into the studio to record only a few months after it\u2019s beggining. their first album simply called \u201cShai Maestro Trio\u201d for the French label \u201cLaborie Jazz\u201d.\nThe album was received amazingly well. Intense tours started immediately after and the trio began playing around the world in festivals, concert halls and jazz club, receiving incredible responses from audiences, peers and the media everywhere they go. In 2012 they shared the stage with Chick Corea\u2019s group, Tigran Hamasyan\u2019s quintet, Esperanza Spalding group and Diana Krall\u2019s band.\n\nThree more albums followed (\"The Road to Ithaca\", \"Untold Stories\", \"The Stone Skipper\") and all were received very positively.\n\n\u201cThe trio is constantly evolving. The music that we play is a reflection of who we are as human beings. Our mission is to blur the differences between life and music, and to try to express the rawest form of our being. I keep learning that music can contain everything: the beauty of our being, but also our \u201cugly\u201d side. For me, it\u2019s about presenting a full picture of the musician, unfiltered. I don\u2019t wish to develop a career of presenting only beautiful pre-meditated music to the audience on the way to success. The three of us are more interested in exploring the essence of our being, and to present that.

After years of dishonest living\u2014consumed by drugs, alcohol, and addiction\u2014such sincerity is jarring from the 30-year-old Chicago-based musician. Liberated from a self-destructive past and born anew in sobriety, Francis has captured an inspired collection of songs steeped in New Orleans rhythms and Chicago blues. His music evokes a bygone era of R&B\u2019s heyday while simultaneously forging a new path on the musical landscape. Ohio-based Karma Chief Records (a subsidiary of rising soul label Colemine Records) will release two songs, \u201cThese Are The Days\u201d and \u201cChanges, Pt. 1,\u201d in early 2019 with the full LP to follow in summer 2019.\n\nThere is a deep connection between Francis\u2019s childhood\u2014his obsession with boogie woogie piano, his father\u2019s gift of a dusty Dr. John LP\u2014and the songs he\u2019s created. The result is an astonishing collection of material without parallel in the contemporary funk and soul scene. The influences are unmistakable: the vocal stylings of Allen Toussaint and Leon Russell; the second line rhythms of The Meters and Dr. John; the barroom rock \u2018n\u2019 roll of The Rolling Stones; the gospel soul of Billy Preston; the roots music of The Band. Francis pays tribute to the masters but has his own story to tell: \u201cIt\u2019s the life I\u2019ve lived so far.\u201d\n\nAnd what a life it\u2019s been. Born Neal Francis O\u2019Hara, the piano prodigy found himself touring Europe by the age of 18 with Muddy Waters\u2019 son and backing up other prominent blues artists coast-to-coast. In 2012, Francis joined popular instrumental funk band The Heard. With Francis at the creative helm, The Heard transformed into a national act, touring with boogaloo progenitors The New Mastersounds and chart toppers The Revivalists and appearing at Jazz Fest and Bear Creek. As The Heard\u2019s star rose, however, Francis sunk deeper into addiction. Once a promising sideman, by 2015 he had been fired from his band, evicted from his apartment, and was perilously close to self-destruction. \u201cWhen you get close to death like that you can feel it,\u201d Francis recalls. An alcohol-induced seizure that year led to a broken femur, dislocated arm, and, finally, the realization that he needed to get clean.\n\nThe journey from a hospital bed to launching his solo career was neither predictable nor straightforward. There were musical fits and starts, relapses, and broken relationships. Yet the overwhelming passion driving Francis in this second act has been an overabundance of creative energy. \u201cDrinking held my music in a half-cocked slingshot. I was always so consumed by drugs and alcohol that I didn\u2019t have the time, money, or creative energy to do it. Sobriety let it loose.\u201d\n\nDetermined to realize the songs swirling in his head, Francis assembled a crack team of musicians, calling on bassist Mike Starr (The Heard) and drummer PJ Howard (The Revivalists, The Heard). He linked up with producer and analog-obsessive Sergio Rios (Orgone, Cee Lo Green, Alicia Keys) and self-funded a trip to Killion Sound in Los Angeles to record the initial batch of material. \u201cI learned to trust my instincts in that room,\u201d says Francis. Buoyed by classic horn arrangements and Rios\u2019 fierce guitar work, the resulting tracks illuminate a lifetime spent studying the masters of soul music.\n\nFrom the RMI electra-piano riff that kicks off \u201cShe\u2019s A Winner\u201d to the screaming organ swells of \u201cThis Time,\u201d Francis and company let it all hang out. This is fun music, dance music. Yet verse after verse and chorus after chorus, Francis wrestles with his past in a straightforward manner: \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I\u2019m not home/ I\u2019m surrounded by people, but I\u2019m really alone.\u201d Like Toussaint and Russell before him he\u2019s married the upbeat rhythms of New Orleans R&B with the lyrical approach of a confessional singer/songwriter. The refrain on \u201cThis Time\u201d serves as a foxhole prayer for a better future: \u201cLet me get it this time/I won\u2019t let you down/Let me get it this time/I won\u2019t fool around.\u201d\n\n2018 has been a busy year. In February Francis finished recording basic tracks for the yet-to-be named debut album in Los Angeles and spent the following months doing overdubs in Chicago with engineer Mike Novak (who also recorded demos for the project). After playing his first show in November, Francis was signed by Paradigm Talent Agency. He is now preparing to tour relentlessly to promote his own music. \u201cI\u2019m doing this to fulfill a drive within myself, but also to pay tribute to the gifts I\u2019ve been given. And it comes from a place of immense gratitude. I\u2019ve been given so much in my life, especially in the last two years, that this feels like a bonus.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "500 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Hod And The Helpers", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.398131, 37.779293], "Date": "Tue Oct 22 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Hotel Utah Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Austin Lucas, Hod and The Helpers at the Hotel Utah Saloon in San Francisco !

And to describe her voice, it\u2019s common to hear words like \"Clear\", \"Pure\", \"Haunting\" and \"Mesmerizing\".\n\nAmy's a California native. After growing up in San Diego, she moved to Santa Cruz for college (go slugs!) and after a fifteen year love affair with the town, moved on to San Francisco where she's lived since 2012. She\u2019s toured the U.S. and Europe, plus recorded and toured with her own French band (The Carbone Band), along with an Artist in Residence in Saint Herblain, France. You also may have heard her song, Carousel, on the hit TV Show, Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nYou can hear Amy perform in a variety of formats. She\u2019s performing frequently in San Francisco with her new energetic groove-rock band, Amy & The Elements. At other times she uses a looper where she can instantly record, playback and perform atop her own performance with harmonies and instruments. And very often she\u2019ll pair things down and simply perform a solo acoustic show highlighting the purity of her songs.\n\nAmy\u2019s musical history stretches back to age five, when she began singing in her school choir. She took up piano at age six and has been studying music ever since. She finally picked up the guitar when she began songwriting at twenty-two.\n\nDuring her long residence in Santa Cruz, she supported local organizations through two benefit concerts called Take Back Your Forest. Collectively they raised six thousand dollars for the Sempervirens Fund, an organization that purchases and protects redwood forest in the Santa Cruz Mountains. She continues to support these types of organizations as much as possible.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

Her work is reflective of transitions, the wilderness, and its navigation. Sometimes she plays banjo, other times acoustic guitar. Often, she plays a Telecaster fronting her band, The Home Team, featuring pedal steel (Tim Marcus), drums (Nick Cobbett), bass (Oscar Westesson), and various other Bay Area musicians.\nDuring her ten years in San Francisco, McFarling has released five independent recordings: studio albums, Distractible Child (2010) and Ridgeline (2013), an EP of cover songs, Others (2013), and two live albums, Live at Pirate Ship Laguna (2009) and Live at Eddie\u2019s Attic (2011). She has toured behind her own projects as well as performing with bands like Y La Bamba and Goodnight Texas, and is one-third of the all-female folk trio Glittersnatch with Megan Keely and Wolf Larsen. Over the years, McFarling has shared the stage with artists such as Shovels and Rope, Sean Hayes, Chris Pureka, Jolie Holland, and has made a home for herself in the San Francisco music community.\nWater Dog, McFarling\u2019s latest release, is her most intimate and folk-leaning record to date. She recorded the album in seasonal segments of 2016. The songs were first demoed with Allen Rothschild in his bedroom in Asheville, NC, where the creaks of his wood floor and the sounds of summer winding down made their way onto the recordings through open windows and live takes.The demos became the foundation of the record, and McFarling took them back to San Francisco, where Avi Vinocur of Goodnight Texas produced and engineered the majority of the record at his home in the Sunset District. \u201cRecording at Avi\u2019s house gave us the time to let the songs breathe and evolve.\u201d McFarling said of the process. \u201cIt gave us space to make decisions at our own pace. I\u2019ve never made a record like that, and it was a really special time. These songs were written in quiet spaces that were lived in. It made sense to record them in that way.\u201d\nThe album is a reflection on inward motion; on the way that water and its movement dominates our lives and bodies. It\u2019s about love, trust, and how we come to know the things we know. Above all, it\u2019s about the cycles of nature that have the power to be both grounding and destructive. \u201cWhile I was writing these songs, I was thinking a lot about family, stability, and love; and I was simultaneously starting to spend more time in and around the ocean. I was getting in the water a lot, and it opened a conversation about the nature of flow; learning to move with changes, instead of against them.\u201d\nIn addition to producing, Vinocur also plays on most of Water Dog and his work is prominent on signature tracks, like \u201cBoth.\u201d \u201cThat song was totally different when I brought it in. Avi simplified the groove, and made it more compelling.\u201d says McFarling. Vinocur also helped complete the writing of \u201cCaney Fork Overlook,\u201d one of the record\u2019s more classic country tunes. \u201cThat song had been half written for years. I wrote it in my van while on a road trip on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it was one of those songs that I never had expectations for. I wasn\u2019t sure it would be on the record. Avi helped get it to a place where it shines.\u201d In other more stripped down songs, McFarling often played live in one take. \u201cThe Storms are Getting Stronger,\u201d \u201cSpring Clean\u201d, and \u201cBox\u201d are songs that have been played in many different arrangements, mostly upbeat with a full band. For the recordings, I wanted them to go back to what they were when they were first written. Simple, quiet folk songs.\u201d\nAlthough Vinocur and McFarling play the bulk of the instrumentation on the record, they also tapped several trusted Bay Area musicians to explore additional layers of sonic texture. Water Dog features Tim Marcus on pedal steel and dobro, Graham Patzner on fiddle, Andrew Laubacher on percussion, Andrew Brennan on guitars, Oscar Westesson on upright bass, and John Elliott on piano. Austin-based band Whiskey Shivers also makes an appearance singing backup vocals on \u201cCaney Fork Overlook.\u201d\nWater Dog is a first for McFarling in many ways. It is the first record she has made without a band, the first time she approached recording without a deadline, and the first time she has explored stripped down instrumentation. \u201cFrom the beginning, the idea was always to let the songs speak for themselves and try not to get in the way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "549 Magnolia Ave, Larkspur, CA 94939", "Artist": "Lender", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8079884.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.535226, 37.936986], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Alternative, Rock, Jam Rock, Jam Bands, Funk, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Lark Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Lender is a trio of SF Bay Area natives who started playing music together in high school.

After 12 years of playing as many as 300 shows each year, Rev. Peyton, the world\u2019s foremost country blues finger-style picker, along with the biggest little band in the country has pieced together one of the most dedicated followings out there. This following is sure to eat up the bands latest offering, Poor Until Payday, (the second on their own Family Owned Records label through hip Nashville indie Thirty Tigers) out October 5th, a country blues record that was made the right way \u2014 two feet on the ground and both hands getting dirty.\n\nWith all the power of a freight train, the Big Damn Band is known for its live shows. Rev. Peyton delivers guitar pyrotechnics the old fashioned way \u2014 ten fingers, a 6 string and an amp cranked at full tilt. In the country blues style, he plays the bass with his thumb, while picking the lead with his fingers at the same time. When he lifts the guitar behind his head to play there's nothing but skill and 16 gauge nickel strings to make the soundscoming out of the speakers.\n\nBeside him on stage are just two other people. His wife, \u201cWashboard\u201d Breezy Peyton playing with all the nuance and percussive power of a New Orleans drum line, and keeping the train moving is Max Senteney on a lean drum kit including a 5 gallon maple syrup bucket. Together they play Peyton's wildman country blues that's as much ZZ Top as it is Bukka White.\n\nOn Poor Until Payday Peyton wanted a sound as live and electric as the records made in the heyday of 45 rpm blues classics from Chess, Stax and Sun Records. Playing his\nbeloved custom-made National steel resonator, a 1949 Harmony Archtop, a 1954 Supro Dual Tone and a 1955 Kay Speed Demon through a 1949 Supro amp, Rev wanted to restore the \u201cwarmth, pops and hisses\u201d mostly eliminated by modern-day compression. The band played in a room together with minimal micing (using only the best classic pieces they could get) with the main effect being tape saturation.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe result is an album that is direct, soulful and demands to be played loud.\n\nThe themes of songs like the title track, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Steal My Shine\u201d and \u201cI Suffer I Get Tougher\u201d offer the antidote to today\u2019s hard times by touting \u201cperseverance, inspiration and hope\u2026 being your authentic self despite everything lined against you, a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d With a vocal style reflecting both the soulfulness and bite of his idols, Rev has added world-class singer to his already-renowned skills as a finger-pickin\u2019 guitar\nphenom. Breezy and Max also contribute background vocals to most of the songs, with \u201cThe Miss Elizabeth of Country Blues\u201d actually taking the spotlight with a sultry call-and- response showcase on \u201cDirty Swerve,\u201d in which she also contributed to the writing.\n\nPeyton's blues pedigree is well established. Woodshedding since he was 12, Peyton has kept alive a tradition of finger picking pioneered by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt. However, Peyton plays with the energy and attitude of a Howlin' Wolf. Indeed if it has strings he can play it whether that's a custom-built National, a cigarbox, an axe or even a shotgun (seriously, Google it.).\n\nHe's done his homework and been given the blessing of the gatekeepers of the tradition \u2014 even befriending and touring with some of the last of the great Delta Blues and Hill Country blues legends like David \u201cHoneyboy\u201d Edwards, T-Model Ford (whose grandson calls him Unk), and Robert Belfour.\n\nRev and Breezy make their home in rural southern Indiana near the adopted home of bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, among national parks and forests in what began as an artist\u2019s colony. \u201cMost of the people here can both paint a picture and skin a deer,\u201d laughs Breezy.\n\nTheres nothing dusty or sentimental about Peyton's music, though. Theres no songs about picking cotton. They aren't a museum piece. The Big Damn Band have taken nearly a century of blues songsmanship and crafted a thing all their own. There is not a single act out there that sounds like this.\n\nThe Big Damn Band make friends and fans every place they go \u2014 and there are few places they haven't been, having performed in 37 countries. After Poor Until Payday, the only people who won't be on the big damn bandwagon will be people who haven't heard or aren't paying attention.\n\nThis is real, from the heart, handmade music made by people, for people who don\u2019t have time for BS.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Todd Snider", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8991563.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative Country, Rock, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "In many ways, acclaimed singer-songwriter Todd Snider has made a career out of turning left, when everyone else expected him to turn right.

As the title suggests, the album was recorded at the studio formerly owned by Johnny Cash and now owned by his son, John Carter Cash. Snider played all the instruments on the record, mostly guitar and harmonica, but he also played banjo on one song and overdubbed mandolin and percussion on some others. The only other people on the album are Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, who contributed backing vocals to several songs. Among the highlights of the record are a trio of talking blues numbers, which reinforce the fact Snider has come full circle with the album because it was the song \u201cTalking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues\u201d from his 1994 debut, Songs For The Daily Planet, that first launched the native of Portland, Oregon, into the national consciousness.

Then they moved around a lot. They write stories that may revolve around shady characters down on their luck, brothels with an eccentric clientele, or a scorned woman out for revenge. These stories are delivered with sultry female vocals and jazz accompaniment reminiscent of a bygone era. In 2008, Tumbledown House won the 4th annual Singer/Songwriter competition held in Livingston, Montana. After winning the competition, the duo began recording their self-titled debut album, which was released in the summer of \u201909. In the fall of 2009, Tumbledown House embarked on a full U.S. tour to promote their debut album, and went on to share the stage with the likes of Crooked Still, The Dodos, The Devil Makes Three, Keller WIlliams, Elephant Revival, Laura Gibson with Musee Mecanique, and The Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Since then, the band has circled the country another couple of times, toured the South in the spring of 2012 and has toured Alaska once or twice a year for several years now. The duo hunkered down in northern Arizona for a spell where the lawlessness and the cheap booze were fine fodder for a second album. With the help of Lady Luck, they got 3 members of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band on the album and found themselves on the road again. These days, the duo is putting down roots in San Francisco and loving the festive citizenship that abounds there. Whenever possible, they play with a full band of rotating talented characters, and continue to meet up with past band mates whenever on the road, just to see what kind of trouble they can get into.

A favorite on radio and the international touring circuit, Euge Groove has garnered a devout following with his irresistible mix of danceable grooves, mind-bending hooks, R&B infused melodies and inspired solos. Having collaborated with everyone from Tina Turner Elton John and Bonnie Raitt to Tower of Power and Aaron Neville, Euge Groove is never short on inspiration. On November 17, 2017, Shanachie Entertainment will release Euge Groove\u2019s anticipated eleventh solo recording, Groove On, an exhilarating collection of originals. Euge\u2019s latest drives home the multi-instrumentalist\u2019s ability to mastermind the perfect mood-drenched set filled with top drawer performances featuring first rate musicians including special guests \u2013 guitar wizard Peter White and soul-jazz diva/label mate Lindsey Webster. \u201cI hope my fans hear growth. That is most important to me,\u201d shares Euge Groove. \u201cI think if I stop growing as a writer, player, or producer, it\u2019s time to quit. I put every drop of heart and soul into each album.\u201d\n\nGroove On opens with the enticing, jubilant and free-flowing \u201cSonnet XI\u201d showcasing Euge Groove\u2019s pristine and soaring soprano saxophone lines. Euge also mixes it up on the Hammond B3 (which he does on several tracks). \u201cI actually started playing B3 back in the 90s while on tour with Joe Cocker. I love the sound of the B3. I have a great old B3 at my studio that was a gift from my dad some years ago and I love to use it when I can. I leave the heavy lifting to the experts though. Tim Heinz did a great job on numerous tracks this album.\u201d In addition to Heinz, Euge Groove has culled together an A-list cast on Groove On featuring guitarists Peter White and Jabu Smith, vocalist Lindsey Webster, keyboardist Tracy Carter, bassist Cornelius Mims, drummers Trevor Lawrence, Jr. and Dan Needham, percussionist Lenny Castro and string programmers/arrangers Phillipe Saisse and Austin Creek.\n\nA highlight on Groove On is the energized, pulsating and scintillating title track and album\u2019s first single, which features Euge on flute and keyboard. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous until I can get that title cut down\u201d confesses the multi-instrumentalist. \u201cIt has to be funky and unique for me, but not going too far as to people saying WTH? Once \u2018Groove On\u2019 was written I was like \u201cYes, I can do this!\u201d Euge also features a high-octane reprise of the single at the end of the recording. The serene and blues-tinged \u201cFree Time\u201d brims with delight as Euge's effervescent soprano leads the way, while the melancholy and pensive \"The Healing,\" is a gorgeous ballad that showcases Euge\u2019s stirring soprano alongside the percussive and string magic of Lenny Castro and Phillipe Saisse. Euge explains that the origin of his compositions are fueled by real life experiences. \u201c\u2018The Healing\u2019 is a song that came from something I experienced recently. I suffer from anxiety from time to time, and it really reared its ugly head earlier this year. I just miss home so much sometimes on the road that things can get very dark. Mental health is no joke. I am very blessed to have some great professionals to help me make sense of and get through those periods. \u201cThe Healing\u201d was all about that for me.\u201d Euge\u2019s beautiful ballad will likely bring peace and healing to many who are blessed to hear his heartfelt offering.\n\nGroove On also features the euphoric and swooning \"Round And Round.\" Euge\u2019s signature layering of parts sculpt a magnificent sound collage. The rapturous \u201cEuge One \u2013 Oh- One\u201d underscores Euge\u2019s penchant for writing sublime melodies and highlights the nylon string guitar of Peter White. \u201cPeter is just my buddy of buddies and I have to have him guest somewhere!\u201d shares Euge who also drops the news that his next project will be a duo album with White.\nEuge brings the house down with the down home bluesy and soul-drenched number \"Last Call.\" Euge is no doubt testifying as his gorgeous tenor lines and interplay with guitarist Jabu Smith almost stop you in your tracks. \"Saturday Afternoon\" makes you want to jump to your feet with its cool and swingin\u2019 \u2018steppers vibe\u2019 while the tender ballad \u201cAlways Love You\u201d offers the album\u2019s lone vocal. \u201cLindsey Webster and I met on New Year\u2019s Eve in Germany last year,\u201d states Euge Groove. \u201cShe has such a great voice and writing style and I kept that in my mind for this project. Lindsey wrote killer lyrics and it all came together quite smoothly.\u201d\n\nEuge Groove\u2019s musical sensibilities are hard-won. Born Steven Eugene Grove in Hagerstown, Maryland, he grew up in a musical home. His mother played piano and taught the church choir and Euge began his musical pursuits at the age of seven, beginning with piano and adding saxophone at nine. Two saxophonists had a profound effect on his approach to playing. \u201cOne was French classical player Marcel Mule, who really defied what the sax was supposed to sound like for me and the other was David Sanborn, who took that sound and brought it into the mainstream world,\u201d Euge reminisces. Through the years, Euge\u2019s love of Jazz, R&B, Gospel and Blues have all come together to inform his personalized sound. He explains, \u201cI\u2019ve listened to everyone from Grover (Washington, Jr.) and Sanborn to (Charlie) Parker and Coltrane, as well as (Michael) Brecker, (Stan) Getz, King Curtis, Jr. Walker, Richard Elliot and Kirk Whalum. The more mature we become the more those influences fuse into something new. A graduate of Miami\u2019s School Of Music, Euge launched his professional career in Miami in the mid-80s, playing in salsa bands, Top 40 club bands and doing the occasional high-profile session date like Expose\u2019s \u201cSeasons Change,\u201d a #1 Billboard AC hit. In 1987 he moved to L.A., wrote a track for Richard Elliot\u2019s The Power of Suggestion and Elliot recommended Euge to take over his spot in Tower of Power. Euge toured with TOP for four years, including a year backing Huey Lewis & The News. He went on to record, tour or perform with the likes of Joe Cocker, The Eurythmics, The Gap Band, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Aaron Neville and Richard Marx (that\u2019s Euge\u2019s horn on \u201cKeep Coming Back,\u201d a #1 AC hit duet he recorded with Luther Vandross). In 1999, Euge started recording his own material, dubbing himself Euge Groove, and posting his music on the now-defunct MP3.com website; downloading started almost immediately and Euge was soon topping the MP3.com Jazz chart. He signed soon thereafter with Warner Bros. \u201cVinyl,\u201d his first single from his eponymous Warner Bros. debut, set a record by spending 27 weeks on the R&R charts, eventually ranking #24 for the year. In 2004, Euge Grooves\u2019 Narada debut, Livin\u2019 Large, spent 68 weeks on the Billboard charts. The title track was the #5 most played song for 2004 on the R&R singles chart. Just Feels Right followed in 2005 and its first single was #1 for two months. There followed in the next decade a string of hit singles and best-selling albums; his hit \u201cReligify\u201d was \u2018song of the year\u2019 in 2007, and his albums S7ven Large and House Of Groove each spawned #1 hits. Got 2 Be Groovin\u2019 came in 2014 and 2016 saw the release of Still Euge, which featured the hit title track as well as memorable vocal appearances from Oleta Adams and Rahsaan Patterson.\n\nEuge Groove further asserts himself as a vital force in the continuum of Contemporary Jazz and promises he has no intentions other than to Groove On! \u201cI\u2019ve really not known anything else. It\u2019s been such an amazing run for the last 30 plus years. From the amazing people I\u2019ve toured in support of to being able to do my own thing, sometimes I\u2019ll reflect and just say \u201cwow!\u201d The places I\u2019ve been and the people I\u2019ve met..it\u2019s like a real life fairy tale at times.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information please contact Monifa Brown (973) 579-7763 EXT 26/mbrown@shanachie.com", "otherInfo": "EUGE GROOVE"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "The Big Forgive", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Niki Saint Kitten Presents The Love Songs Record Release Show!"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Sting Raze", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8340364.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "Genres: rock, heavy rock, psychedelic rock, funk rock, future rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Mantrah", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Livingmore", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8922796.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Rock, Alexandra Moore, Livingmore, Spencer Livingston, Los Angeles Music, La Bands, Melodic Indie Rock, Harmonies, beautiful pop, americana, Americana, Folk Rock, Folk Rock Pop, Guitar Band, Singer, Songwriter, Musician, Pretty, Beautiful, Happy Sad, Haunting, Haunting Melodies, Rock Pop, Folk Pop, Indie Band, Indie Rock, Indie Pop, Alternative, Rocknroll, vibey", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Livingmore is the collaboration between songwriters Alex Moore and Spencer Livingston with help from Mike Schadel on drums/keys and\nRodrigo Moreno on bass guitar.

Currently, the group is touring the country to share their raucous honkytonk, dirty blues, roadhouse rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, and tear jerking country balladry.\n\nThe music of Sean K. Preston draws heavily on the influences of the classic heartbroken sounds of Country & Western music from the 40\u2019s through the 70\u2019s, the honesty of the Blues by the likes of Robert Johnson and John Lee Hooker, the bombast of 50\u2019s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, the lyrical sophistication of musical poets like Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan and Nick Cave, the raw energy of Punk, and the spirituality of Mountain Gospel. His own songs range from delicate laments and lullabies to fiery sermons and confessions.\n\nSean\u2019s interest in music developed as a teenager while growing up in Alice Springs, a small desert town in northern Australia. Sean fell in love with the early Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll, Country, and Blues that filled his father\u2019s record collection. When he and his family moved to the United States, Sean would go to his first rock concerts, inspiring him to learn guitar. Eventually, Sean\u2019s music took him to Ireland where he made his living performing on the streets of Dublin. His move back to Baltimore prompted a successful solo career with his self produced debut record \u201cHoarse Whisper\u201d and his 6 song EP \u201cSean K. Preston.\u201d In 2013, Sean began to form his touring band \u201cSean K. Preston & The Loaded Pistols\u201d and released a full length album, \u201cThe Colt From Old Regret.\u201d The addition of two integral members in 2013 and 2015 gave Sean the audacious sound he was searching for.\n\nChristopher \u201cSparky\u201d Spiridigliozzi went from beating on trash cans as a kid growing up in Hampton, VA to drumming and singing in gigging garage rock bands by the time he was 16. Sparky taught himself guitar during his time in the US Navy and eventually made his way to Baltimore where he spent 7 years playing guitar and singing as the frontman for Mother Jefferson. After building a career in radio and raising a family, Sparky went back to drums full time playing for numerous Baltimore based garage, surf, and punk bands. When he is not touring, Sparky is expertly repairing vintage drum kits at Baltimore\u2019s most reputable drum shop or writing and recording for his solo musical project, Sparky\u2019s BUTTERKNIFE.\n\nCory McGrath was raised on Black Sabbath and Bad Company in the military town of Browns Mills, NJ. His love for playing music began with drums, but he would later go on to play upright bass for 8 years with Full Blown Cherry. Cory\u2019s style is heavily influenced by the sounds of 1960\u2019s garage rock and high octane country. He currently resides in Philadelphia, PA. When Cory isn\u2019t playing music on the road you can find him hunched over his 1944 Chevy project in the garage or driving around in his 1976 Ford Torino.\n\nSean K. Preston & The Loaded Pistols have appeared on stage at Muddy Roots Festival, Westport Roots Festival, and Crooked Smile. They spent this past winter in the studio recording their upcoming album and shooting music videos. With a national tour coming up this fall, the band is spending the summer touring the east coast and working on new material.\n\n\nIt\u2019s Blues - Punk - Country - Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll...Amen.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2800 24th St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "MUSIC THERAPY", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408398, 37.752973], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Pop's Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Music Therapy\" w/ DJ Clave"}, {"Address": "2344 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Pussy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/147991.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.434294, 37.763629], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Beaux", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Pussy Party\" w/ Sasha, Ms. Jackson, and guests"}, {"Address": "3248 22nd St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "29TH STREET SWINGTET", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419552, 37.755527], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Revolution Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "29th Street Swingtet at Revolution Cafe: The walls of this breezy Mission District cafe display a continuously changing exhibition of local visual art, and Papa Toby's diverse music calendar follows suit.

Working the decks since his early adolescence, Toure is highly skilled every element of DJing from live performances to the fine art of turntablism. After spinning at a number of clubs in Chicago\u2019s underground hip-hop scene before being able to legally drink, Toure relocated to Tallahassee, Florida to attend college. It was here in Florida where Toure displayed his taste making pedigree by breaking Rick Ross\u2019s introductory single \u201cHustlin\u201d on his Collateral Payment mixtape. Becoming one of the area\u2019s requested DJ\u2019s, Toure soon found himself spinning at clubs nearly every day of the week. From this point Toure landed his first radio gig with Florida A&M\u2019s 90.5 FM, working three nights a week. Developing a cult following, 100.7 FM \u201cThe Beat\u201d owned by media giant Clear Channel came calling. Once 100.7 went defunct, Toure moved on to Cumulus Media owned \u201cBlazin\u201d 102.3 FM where he worked until graduating from Florida A&M with honors. Returning to Chicago with his degree and a well-earned reputation in hand, Toure went on to perform at nearly of all Chicago\u2019s major venues, spinning at a number of celebrity hosted events including Pierre Thomas\u2019s Super Bowl victory party in Chicago and Derrick Rose\u2019s All-Star Bash in Los Angeles and many more. These accolades landed him a professional gig with acclaimed recording artist Mikkey Halsted with whom he toured the nation extensively. In 2011, Toure\u2019s versatility attracted the attention of Grammy winning recording artist Estelle. After being blown away by his immaculate presentation and genre-bending mixing in person, Estelle signed Toure as her official tour DJ, further legitimizing his already elite reputation. With Estelle, Toure has broadened his international profile, drawing rave reviews from partygoers and promoters from Europe to Africa and back again.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2925 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "DJ Tragic", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.417909, 37.764929], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Slate Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "DJ Tragic at Slate Bar: Slate has mod-minimalist decor, funky DJs, karaoke, food and happy hour 5-9 pm!"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Mophono", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Wed Oct 23 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-23", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "AMEN!

He began playing classical piano at the age of 5 under the instruction of Ms. Irena Krivatz. His first exposure to Jazz music was at the age of 8 while listening to Oscar Peterson\u2019s records and particularly \u201cThe Gershwin Songbook\u201d.\n\nMaestro was later accepted to the Thelma \u2013 Yellin High School of Performing Arts in Givataim, Israel where he completed his studies with honors. While taking extended literature classes, Shai was one of the few students combining a major both in the jazz and classical departments along with his regular studies.\n\nAt the age of 16, Maestro attended Berklee College of Music\u2019s \u20185 week Summer Program\u2019 in Boston where he auditioned for the full time (4 years) program, and received a full scholarship. Maestro never took this offer. That\u2019s when he got a phone call from Avishai Cohen (Double Bass player and composer, known for his career both as a sideman for Chick Corea and for his current career as a successful bandleader) and was invited to join the band. Maestro joined Avishai Cohen\u2019s Trio together with drummer Mark Guiliana where he played for 5 years all around the world.\n\nIn 2011, Maestro left Avishai\u2019s group to pursue his own career as a band leader.\n\n\u201cIt was the right time. I felt this bubbling energy inside that led me to continue my road and to take this difficult leap towards becoming a band leader\u201d.\nShai Maestro Trio was formed in July 2010 in Brooklyn after playing at Maestro\u2019s practice studio.\n\nThe trio went into the studio to record only a few months after it\u2019s beggining. their first album simply called \u201cShai Maestro Trio\u201d for the French label \u201cLaborie Jazz\u201d.\nThe album was received amazingly well. Intense tours started immediately after and the trio began playing around the world in festivals, concert halls and jazz club, receiving incredible responses from audiences, peers and the media everywhere they go. In 2012 they shared the stage with Chick Corea\u2019s group, Tigran Hamasyan\u2019s quintet, Esperanza Spalding group and Diana Krall\u2019s band.\n\nThree more albums followed (\"The Road to Ithaca\", \"Untold Stories\", \"The Stone Skipper\") and all were received very positively.\n\n\u201cThe trio is constantly evolving. The music that we play is a reflection of who we are as human beings. Our mission is to blur the differences between life and music, and to try to express the rawest form of our being. I keep learning that music can contain everything: the beauty of our being, but also our \u201cugly\u201d side. For me, it\u2019s about presenting a full picture of the musician, unfiltered. I don\u2019t wish to develop a career of presenting only beautiful pre-meditated music to the audience on the way to success.

As the Truth or Consequences, NM-based \u2018Harmonic Alternative Folk\u2019 duo Flagship Romance they live, work, and annually travel tens of thousands of miles together, deeply in love with each other and the process of bringing their emotionally powerful music to the people. It is an inspiring union of hearts, minds and souls that entrances all who encounter them and their art.\n\n\"Their songs & vocals have a simmering intensity... I also suspect Fisher used to play in rock bands, as he tended to attack his guitar with an unbridled ferociousness.\" - Mayer Danzig // Twangville\n\nFluent, intense acoustic guitar playing; lyrics of life\u2019s peaks, troughs, mysteries and wonders; soaring, yearning vocals; tender, though oft-anthemic melodies, and harmonies one could barely separate with a single human hair: this is the Flagship Romance sound. Live, sharing a custom-built dual microphone stand, they deliver their beautiful material with passionate abandon, living each song as if it will be the last they will ever perform. Such commitment to their music and stagecraft has, in just a few short years, seen the aptly-monikered Flagship Romance become huge favourites of the North American house concert circuit. This suits them just fine, as Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s preferred performance scenario is an intimate venue where the audience is tucked up close enough to them that they can hear them breathe (and, unfailingly, gasp at Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s chemistry and dynamics). Yet they have also appeared at festivals, clubs and concert halls, sharing stages with international acts including Half Moon Run, Iris DeMent, Mason Jennings and the Goo Goo Dolls.\n\nFlagship Romance are on the road for upwards of eight months a year, and have been pretty much since the release of their 2013 debut EP, The Fudge Sessions. If ever a testament to this extraordinary work ethic were needed, it would be the reaction to the crowdfunding campaign they launched to finance their 2014 full-length debut, an ambitious and ultimately stunning CD/DVD project entitled Fee Fie Foh Fum. Recorded live off the floor \u2013 difficult to comprehend considering its quality \u2013 the album captures the bristling energy of Flagship Romance live shows, and was created with the considerable backing of the duo\u2019s rapidly burgeoning legion of fans, to the tune of over $25,000.\n\nOn the back of such a successful project, one that emphatically delivered on their promises, a sophomore full-length was hotly anticipated. Lo and behold, another overwhelmingly positive Kickstarter campaign ensured that Flagship Romance could craft 2017\u2019s Tales from the Self-Help Section exactly as they wished to, employing a subtly richer sound and new vocal approaches by Jordyn. Produced by Lucio Rubino at The Fish Tank Recordings in St. Augustine, FL, Tales from the Self-Help Section is a personal, largely self-examining and emotional 12-song opus, documenting \u201cthe little victories, failures and lessons\u201d Shawn and Jordyn have experienced during the last couple of years, \u201cmostly dealing with the battles of \u2018being present,\u2019 and living with depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nOn the evidence of their gorgeous work to date it is clear that the love and skill of which John Ruskin spoke intertwine in perfect harmony in the cases of Shawn Fisher and Jordyn Jackson, and that, indeed, little masterpieces are the results. Yes, Ruskin would have loved Flagship Romance.\n\n......\n\nFlagship Romance has aligned their musical career with the clean water cause via the organization charity: water. In August 2012, Fisher and Jackson founded and organized the Clean Water Music Fest in Florida, to raise funding and awareness for the 800 million people on this planet without access to safe, clean drinking water. Since then, they have raised over $125,000; 100% of that money is currently being used for well building and tap-stand projects in Ethiopia, Rwanda, and the Sahel region of Africa.\n\nBiography by David Morrison, Folk Radio UK", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "261 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Benedicte Maurseth", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9491083.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.406579, 37.797601], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "City Lights Booksellers & Publishers", "moreBioInfo": "Benedicte Maurseth is a Norwegian folk musician, composer and writer.

His chances to make it in music started to slip away.\nUndeterred, Tom kept writing songs - 60 in total - often from his hospital bed, occasionally in quarantine. At the start of 2016, with no expectations, he began releasing them as EPs. To his astonishment, he was an overnight streaming sensation and within months, in Britain, a radio staple.\n\u201cI still have to pinch myself,\u201d says Tom, a Londoner who studied at LIPA, where he won the top songwriting prize and performed for Paul McCartney. \u201cTwo years ago, I wasn\u2019t sure anyone wanted to hear my music. I had zero followers and no interest. I put out one EP with no goal in sight and straight away it went crazy.\n\u201cI\u2019d never thought about Brazil until Little Love went to No.1. I was at No.7 on Spotify\u2019s global chart. I heard my song on Eastenders. With every day came more good news. I couldn\u2019t be happier. When you\u2019ve been through an awful experience, you become very sensitive to things going right. I\u2019m loving every moment.\u201d\nOver two years, Tom independently released six EPs and saw his monthly followers surpass two million. Five of the songs were playlisted by Radio 2 \u2013 he was Graham Norton\u2019s most played act of 2017.\nIn between, he was back in hospital twice, but still writing and continuing to play live whenever possible. Just four days after his most recent hospital spell, in June 2018, he was on stage supporting Snow Patrol. He has since toured with Tom Odell and The Kooks and sold out his own shows everywhere from Europe to the States. During his next trip to Brazil, he\u2019s been asked to appear in a soap opera.\n\u201cSince the summer, I\u2019ve pretty much gigged non-stop \u2013 the offers just keep coming in,\u201d says Tom. \u201cDuring one fortnight I took nine flights, between Europe, the US and Mexico. Recently I supported someone from Glee. I have no idea how I got the gig, but it\u2019s fantastic to be asked. Other artists have been so supportive.\u201d\nIt was support from other artists that helped Tom\u2019s career take off on leaving LIPA in 2014. Having grown up in bands, he decided to become a singer/songwriter after attending a Damien Rice gig. He put a few solo songs on Soundcloud and a video for his track Willow Tree on YouTube. Accolades were instant.\nKeane took Tom under their wing and helped him record early demos. Ryan Adams tweeted about Willow Tree. Ed Sheeran, Ben Howard and Travis offered him support slots. Label and publishing offers flooded in. Tom was set to sign when his Crohn\u2019s first kicked in and his life was turned upside down.\n\u201cEvery time I went in to hospital, the recovery took months,\u201d explains Tom. \u201cEvery time I thought was coping with it, something else would go wrong. I was always writing songs, but people\u2019s patience runs out. Any plans you make go out the window. A&R people change jobs. I\u2019d never had an official release. By the time I put out the first EP, it was just me and my manager and no budget.\u201d\n\u00a32000 was borrowed from a family friend for the initial recordings. Little Love was the first EP and its lead song exploded. Graham Norton, Zoe Ball, Jo Whiley and Dermot O\u2019Leary declared themselves fans and by EP 3, Tom was all over Radio 2.\nThe stage is set for Collide, Tom\u2019s debut album, to be one of pop\u2019s highlights of 2019. Recorded, as were the EPs, with producer Chris Bond in Devon, Collide features a dozen songs, eight of them new, plus Willow Tree, Little Love and former singles Want You and Closer.\n\u201cFrom day one, Chris and I had a clear vision in mind,\u201d says Tom. \u201cEverything is played live so that you can feel the energy. Writing-wise, I\u2019m influenced by The Beatles, Neil Young and Simon & Garfunkel, but I love the lush, soundscapey production of artists like Bon Iver. I\u2019m a singer/songwriter but all of the songs have a big sound and most have backing vocals.\u201d\nOn Collide, Chris plays drums, synths, bass and strings. Lydia Clowes, who performs with Tom live, duets and guests on several of the songs, including gorgeous new single Strangers Now, one of two tracks co-written by Lisa Hannigan.\n\u201cStrangers Now is probably the angstiest song on the album,\u201d says Tom. \u201cIt\u2019s about my parents\u2019 divorce. I asked Lisa to write the female verse and couldn\u2019t believe it when she said yes. I\u2019m a huge fan. To work with her was a dream.\u201d\nAt times on Collide, you\u2019ll hear Tom in love. Elsewhere he\u2019s heartbroken.\n\u201cThe title refers to both colliding as in coming together and collision, as in head on,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI was dumped twice, both times while I was in hospital. \u201cHarsh? Yes, but on the positive side, I got some songs out of it.\u201d\nOn the spectral title track, written in his ex\u2019s Belfast flat in just 20 minutes, Tom\u2019s still smitten. On Alice and Lost To Me, the second Lisa co-write, he\u2019s licking his wounds.\n\u201cLost To Me I wrote with a cannula in my left hand,\u201d recalls Tom. \u201cI was in quarantine for a week and my mum brought in my guitar. It wasn\u2019t easy to play because I\u2019m left-handed but it stopped me climbing the walls.\u201d\nInto The Night was inspired by the Netflix series Stranger Things, to which Tom is addicted. The Devon birds that appear on the song also star on the album\u2019s spectacular closer Evermore, alongside a 15 strong roll call of guests, including Chris\u2019 musician brother Bear and members of The Staves and Turin Brakes.\n\u201cWe had a choir in there too,\u201d says Tom. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a big production, as is most of Collide. I didn\u2019t want the songs to be just me and an acoustic guitar. I love having the freedom to bring people in and mix things up. I also like sneaking in solos. No one does solos anymore.\u201d\nAs for Tom\u2019s future, it couldn\u2019t be brighter.\n\u201cMy Crohn\u2019s will never go away but at the moment, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been travelling and working loads and it hasn\u2019t flared up. I mean, I\u2019m now the least rock\u2019n\u2019roll person on the planet \u2013 no alcohol, no meat, no nuts, nothing with too much fibre \u2013 but it helps my work ethic because I\u2019m never hungover.\n\u201cMy hopes for next year are to stay healthy and play at least 100 gigs. Whatever happens, I\u2019m happy. I\u2019ve made a debut album that I feared for years I wouldn\u2019t. Anything else is icing on the cake.\u201d", "otherInfo": "This show is 21+. All sales are final.\nTom Speight\nTom Speight is making up for lost time. Laid low by illness, beset by problems both personal and professional, the songwriter returned to what he does best: writing songs.\nUsing his convalescence as a musical break, Tom found that music simply tumbled forth, a torrent of ideas, a flood of melody. \u201cI wanted to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cI came out of a big relationship \u2013 four or five years \u2013 and then I was pretty low. I\u2019d just come out of two major operations, so it was a good, cathartic way of getting on with things.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to live life, don\u2019t you? Get your heart broken, meet someone and start something new. Experience things.\u201d\nArmed with some of his finest songs to date, when Tom Speight finally decided to push the button he did so in remarkable style. Four Eps were released across 12 months, racking up more than 12 million Spotify plays, earning support from Radio 2 and a high profile session on Jo Whiley\u2019s show. Desperate to play live, he chalked up more than 80 shows in less than 12 months, from London to Poland, from the Scottish Highlands to the continent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, yeah,\u201d he admits with a smile. \u201cWe went to number one in Brazil. We were number seven in the global viral chart, and number one in their viral chart. Nothing\u2019s changed, really. I always thought the songs were good, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have put them out there.\u201d\nSupremely confident in his own work, Tom has developed a close relationship to producer Chris Bond. Working at Bond\u2019s barnyard studio - \u201cNo phone signal, no internet\u2026 there\u2019s not even running water!\u201d - the pair focus purely on music, getting as close to the songs as they possibly can.\n\u201cWe did all the foundations live,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd then strings, cello, and piano we\u2019d put over it afterwards as overdubs. I think you can hear it in the songs, that it\u2019s not polished. It\u2019s a human thing, which I think is missing in music.\u201d\n\u201cI could give him a dozen songs and he knew pretty much exactly what he was going to do with them. And that was a great feeling, as well. He had a real vision for them.\u201d\nAs a kid, Tom Speight listened endlessly to those early Leonard Cohen albums, even going as far as to borrow his older sister\u2019s classical guitar. That element of simplicity remains in his music, but his recent work feels more inclined towards Ryan Adams\u2019 Autumnal romanticism, or even the simple yet affecting Celtic soul of Damian Rice, where each note has its own place driven by a deeply personal connection to the music.\nThat connection is something that fans feel, too. An entirely organic success story, Tom Speight has returned from the brink to find success in the only way he knows how \u2013 great songwriting, delivered on each and every gig. \u201cFans call me \u2018friend\u2019 - they think I\u2019m their friend!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cI write messages for them when they buy the deluxe CD. You feel like you get to know people. I know what some of them do for jobs or how their wife is or something like that. It\u2019s that nice feeling of having personal interactions with the fans. It\u2019s important.\u201d\nWith four more Eps planned for 2017 \u2013 and countless international shows on the books \u2013 Tom Speight is able to relax a little, to breathe a little easier. \u201cI think there\u2019s been months where I haven\u2019t written a song,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing, though. I don\u2019t think you should force them out.\u201d\nWholly natural and completely organic, Tom Speight is able to find success at his own pace.

His 3-1/2 octave vocal range, dynamic guitar playing, and versatile songwriting allow him to work in a wide range of styles while always preserving his own unique artistic voice.

Beginning in late 2016, he recorded three sets of demos written and arranged for three separate bands, exploring a variety of different sounds and genres. One of these sessions, recorded by Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Antony & the Johnsons, Evan Dando, Phish) and mixed by John Agnello (Kurt Vile, Son Volt, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr), has evolved into Graham's debut full-length, Out of the Sea, which is slated for a late 2019 release.

A typical Graham Norwood Group show covers everything from mellow country-rock to full-on fuzz guitar freakouts, while solo sets put the emphasis on Graham's singing, which has earned frequent comparisons to Jeff Buckley, Jim James and (Graham's beloved) Harry Nilsson. Whether he's playing with a full band or captivating a room with just his voice and acoustic guitar, Graham\u2019s performances are not to be missed.

New fans buy THREE DOG NIGHT\u2019s music on iTunes as well as at record stores. In fact, their releases from this decade alone have sold well over a million and a half albums and the band\u2019s continued popularity has landed \u201cThe Best of Three Dog Night : 20th Century Masters\u201d on the Billboard Top 200 Album Chart for 9 of the last 12 months.

Danny Hutton, who was a writer/producer at Hanna Barbera Records as well as a solo artist, met Cory Wells, lead singer of The Enemys which was the house band at the Whisky A Go-Go, while they were both touring with Sonny and Cher.

Tens of millions of THREE DOG NIGHT records have been sold through the years. THREE DOG NIGHT recorded the music of the best (and mostly undiscovered) new songwriters of their time including Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, Elton John, Laura Nyro, Paul Williams and Hoyt Axton among many others. The group\u2019s eclectic taste, combined with their ability to recognize and record hits in a unique, distinctive and appealing style, resulted in THREE DOG NIGHT dominating the charts for years. The band toured extensively in the late \u201960\u2019s and into the 70\u2019s, but in 1975, the non-stop concerts and hit-making took its toll. According to Cory Wells, \"we just quietly backed out of the picture\". Their desire to \"get away\" from the hectic world of pop music was relatively short-lived however, and by 1981 they discovered that they wanted to perform again. \"The old magic was still there\", noted Danny. Audiences agree. Now, as they mark more than 40 years on the road, THREE DOG NIGHT continue to grow their fan base and develop new ways of doing business. In 2012 they are pursuing an extensive schedule of concerts at theatres, performing arts centers, fairs, festivals, corporate events, and casinos. Since 1986, they have performed over 2,200 shows including two Super Bowls.

Artists across the board have discovered Jacobs\u2019 musicianship and supple versatility, resulting in an impressive variety of formats in which he has played over the last few years. After a decade, five records, and 200 shows a year as principal songwriter and frontman for beloved Baltimore-based band The Bridge from 2001-2011, Jacobs wasted no time continuing to write music of his own and exploring different configurations for his craft. He released his debut solo album, Songs for Cats and Dogs, in 2012, and continued to perform relentlessly, both with his new band and as a solo artist. In doing so, he quickly garnered the admiration of a variety of predecessors and peers: rock legend Steve Winwood saw Jacobs perform in 2014 and soon invited him to open his national tour. The following year, Sturgill Simpson extended the same invitation. Never limited by genre, Jacobs and New Orleans heavyweight Ivan Neville recorded a collaborative album under the band name \u201cNeville Jacobs\u201d, which will be released in 2017. As an adapting, evolving, versatile musician who has survived on his own merit, Jacobs continues to win over audiences of many tastes, as he brings his characteristic authenticity and soul to every set.\n\nJacobs feels there are common threads across many genres of music, and he has harnessed over a decade of trans-genre exploration on his second solo album, Dust to Gold, released in 2016, from American Showplace Music. The album is a soul-stirring expression of the current chapter of his creative evolution, featuring twelve well-crafted songs that masterfully weave through the sweet and rugged landscape of soul, country, folk, blues, gospel, and rock and roll. Through every turn, one can easily feel Jacobs\u2019 reverence to his influences, but the result is an original, eclectic record with a sound that is authentically his. In a given moment, Jacobs\u2019 guitar playing is gritty, soulful, rich, and lyrical. It\u2019s subtle, yet adventurous. His voice is at once sweet and sultry, with a honeyed whiskey croon that delivers his thoughtful, expressive lyrics.\n\nI know that the well I seek is bound to be the deepest of all been ever told I know that to plant a seed is alchemy, we can watch the dust turn into gold\n\nSo sings the hypnotic refrain in \u201cTurn Into Gold\u201d, a meditative slide-guitar rocker where Jacobs sings about channeling the muse, or \u201ctapping the source\u201d, as he calls it. It\u2019s about the desire to be \u201cenraptured in the mystery, the unknown, the questions, the answers all at once,\u201d Jacobs describes. This is the place in which his songwriting occurs, and from where Jacobs\u2019 performances derive so much electricity. In discussing the song\u2019s inspiration, Jacobs reflects, \u201cif I\u2019m playing or singing and I\u2019m really connected to that source and I\u2019m really locked in and there\u2019s a room full of people experiencing that, the hope is then for them to get locked into their own thing, and it\u2019s this beautiful, ecstatic magic that happens. To me, this is that elusive goal that I chase every time I sit down to write a song or every time I get on stage to perform.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Dust to Gold paint Jacobs\u2019 desire to express the beauty and struggle of the human condition. In \u201cCold Carolina\u201d, Jacobs pleads softly and emotively about a despondent relationship, the feeling of displacement, and the seeking of redemption, of salvation. In \u201cLittle Dreamer\u201d, Jacobs, accompanied by his wife, Kat Jacobs, sings sweetly to their unborn child, whom he discovered was on the way only moments before leaving to start recording the album. \u201cIt\u2019s a blink of an eye, this life / tiny grains in sands of time / so tie your purposes on wings and fly to the heavens with the grace and courage of a thousand kings\u201d, he sings to the tiny, nascent being.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cThe Devil or Jesse James\u201d, is a rousing mixture of New Orleans rhythm, blues, and rock and roll with ethereal tendrils of psychedelic guitar reaching out across the soundscape; painting a tale of a man trying to change identities and run away from one\u2019s past. On the album, the full band includes a richly funky rhythm section, featuring Todd\n\nHerrington on bass, Dusty Ray Simmons on drums, as well as John Ginty on Hammond organ and keyboards, who has been a master side man for years, working with Robert Randolph and the Family Band, Jewel, Citizen Cope; and most currently tours with the Dixie Chicks.\n\nThough \u201cDust to Gold\u201d clearly showcases Jacobs\u2019 well-worn songwriting chops, he is an improviser at heart, and he brings the spirit of seeking and living in the moment to the stage each time. In every performance, he tries to push the envelope, exploring the depth of each song anew. Whether live or on the album, Jacobs\u2019 dynamic voice and guitar envelope the listener completely and instantly, transporting you into the rich, sultry folds of his soulful sound.\n\nCris Jacobs continues to nurture a devoted audience that knows that whatever the instrumentation or setting he plays, it will be richly authentic, and conveyed with an improviser\u2019s curious spirit and palpable presence. We can only expect further evolution from Jacobs, an artist constantly inspired by the search for \u201cthose beautiful, sad, inspiring, heartbreaking magical corners of life. The most rewarding, and terrifying part of trying to be an artist is the journey itself, the vulnerability and riskiness in seeking them out trying to express them. Sometimes you hit dead ends, and sometimes you strike pure gold.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Cris Jacobs Band plays the Grate Room!"}, {"Address": "859 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "MEUTE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8565173.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "Genres: Techno, Deep House, Electro", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "MEUTE is a Techno Marching Band \u2013 a dozen drummers and horn players from Hamburg/Germany who fulfil the job of a DJ with their acoustic instruments.\nThe archaic combination of brass and drums forms the basis of a new genre that combines hypnotic, driving techno with expressive brass band music.

A favorite on radio and the international touring circuit, Euge Groove has garnered a devout following with his irresistible mix of danceable grooves, mind-bending hooks, R&B infused melodies and inspired solos. Having collaborated with everyone from Tina Turner Elton John and Bonnie Raitt to Tower of Power and Aaron Neville, Euge Groove is never short on inspiration. On November 17, 2017, Shanachie Entertainment will release Euge Groove\u2019s anticipated eleventh solo recording, Groove On, an exhilarating collection of originals. Euge\u2019s latest drives home the multi-instrumentalist\u2019s ability to mastermind the perfect mood-drenched set filled with top drawer performances featuring first rate musicians including special guests \u2013 guitar wizard Peter White and soul-jazz diva/label mate Lindsey Webster. \u201cI hope my fans hear growth. That is most important to me,\u201d shares Euge Groove. \u201cI think if I stop growing as a writer, player, or producer, it\u2019s time to quit. I put every drop of heart and soul into each album.\u201d\n\nGroove On opens with the enticing, jubilant and free-flowing \u201cSonnet XI\u201d showcasing Euge Groove\u2019s pristine and soaring soprano saxophone lines. Euge also mixes it up on the Hammond B3 (which he does on several tracks). \u201cI actually started playing B3 back in the 90s while on tour with Joe Cocker. I love the sound of the B3. I have a great old B3 at my studio that was a gift from my dad some years ago and I love to use it when I can. I leave the heavy lifting to the experts though. Tim Heinz did a great job on numerous tracks this album.\u201d In addition to Heinz, Euge Groove has culled together an A-list cast on Groove On featuring guitarists Peter White and Jabu Smith, vocalist Lindsey Webster, keyboardist Tracy Carter, bassist Cornelius Mims, drummers Trevor Lawrence, Jr. and Dan Needham, percussionist Lenny Castro and string programmers/arrangers Phillipe Saisse and Austin Creek.\n\nA highlight on Groove On is the energized, pulsating and scintillating title track and album\u2019s first single, which features Euge on flute and keyboard. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous until I can get that title cut down\u201d confesses the multi-instrumentalist. \u201cIt has to be funky and unique for me, but not going too far as to people saying WTH? Once \u2018Groove On\u2019 was written I was like \u201cYes, I can do this!\u201d Euge also features a high-octane reprise of the single at the end of the recording. The serene and blues-tinged \u201cFree Time\u201d brims with delight as Euge's effervescent soprano leads the way, while the melancholy and pensive \"The Healing,\" is a gorgeous ballad that showcases Euge\u2019s stirring soprano alongside the percussive and string magic of Lenny Castro and Phillipe Saisse. Euge explains that the origin of his compositions are fueled by real life experiences. \u201c\u2018The Healing\u2019 is a song that came from something I experienced recently. I suffer from anxiety from time to time, and it really reared its ugly head earlier this year. I just miss home so much sometimes on the road that things can get very dark. Mental health is no joke. I am very blessed to have some great professionals to help me make sense of and get through those periods. \u201cThe Healing\u201d was all about that for me.\u201d Euge\u2019s beautiful ballad will likely bring peace and healing to many who are blessed to hear his heartfelt offering.\n\nGroove On also features the euphoric and swooning \"Round And Round.\" Euge\u2019s signature layering of parts sculpt a magnificent sound collage. The rapturous \u201cEuge One \u2013 Oh- One\u201d underscores Euge\u2019s penchant for writing sublime melodies and highlights the nylon string guitar of Peter White. \u201cPeter is just my buddy of buddies and I have to have him guest somewhere!\u201d shares Euge who also drops the news that his next project will be a duo album with White.\nEuge brings the house down with the down home bluesy and soul-drenched number \"Last Call.\" Euge is no doubt testifying as his gorgeous tenor lines and interplay with guitarist Jabu Smith almost stop you in your tracks. \"Saturday Afternoon\" makes you want to jump to your feet with its cool and swingin\u2019 \u2018steppers vibe\u2019 while the tender ballad \u201cAlways Love You\u201d offers the album\u2019s lone vocal. \u201cLindsey Webster and I met on New Year\u2019s Eve in Germany last year,\u201d states Euge Groove. \u201cShe has such a great voice and writing style and I kept that in my mind for this project. Lindsey wrote killer lyrics and it all came together quite smoothly.\u201d\n\nEuge Groove\u2019s musical sensibilities are hard-won. Born Steven Eugene Grove in Hagerstown, Maryland, he grew up in a musical home. His mother played piano and taught the church choir and Euge began his musical pursuits at the age of seven, beginning with piano and adding saxophone at nine. Two saxophonists had a profound effect on his approach to playing. \u201cOne was French classical player Marcel Mule, who really defied what the sax was supposed to sound like for me and the other was David Sanborn, who took that sound and brought it into the mainstream world,\u201d Euge reminisces. Through the years, Euge\u2019s love of Jazz, R&B, Gospel and Blues have all come together to inform his personalized sound. He explains, \u201cI\u2019ve listened to everyone from Grover (Washington, Jr.) and Sanborn to (Charlie) Parker and Coltrane, as well as (Michael) Brecker, (Stan) Getz, King Curtis, Jr. Walker, Richard Elliot and Kirk Whalum. The more mature we become the more those influences fuse into something new. A graduate of Miami\u2019s School Of Music, Euge launched his professional career in Miami in the mid-80s, playing in salsa bands, Top 40 club bands and doing the occasional high-profile session date like Expose\u2019s \u201cSeasons Change,\u201d a #1 Billboard AC hit. In 1987 he moved to L.A., wrote a track for Richard Elliot\u2019s The Power of Suggestion and Elliot recommended Euge to take over his spot in Tower of Power. Euge toured with TOP for four years, including a year backing Huey Lewis & The News. He went on to record, tour or perform with the likes of Joe Cocker, The Eurythmics, The Gap Band, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Aaron Neville and Richard Marx (that\u2019s Euge\u2019s horn on \u201cKeep Coming Back,\u201d a #1 AC hit duet he recorded with Luther Vandross). In 1999, Euge started recording his own material, dubbing himself Euge Groove, and posting his music on the now-defunct MP3.com website; downloading started almost immediately and Euge was soon topping the MP3.com Jazz chart. He signed soon thereafter with Warner Bros. \u201cVinyl,\u201d his first single from his eponymous Warner Bros. debut, set a record by spending 27 weeks on the R&R charts, eventually ranking #24 for the year. In 2004, Euge Grooves\u2019 Narada debut, Livin\u2019 Large, spent 68 weeks on the Billboard charts. The title track was the #5 most played song for 2004 on the R&R singles chart. Just Feels Right followed in 2005 and its first single was #1 for two months. There followed in the next decade a string of hit singles and best-selling albums; his hit \u201cReligify\u201d was \u2018song of the year\u2019 in 2007, and his albums S7ven Large and House Of Groove each spawned #1 hits. Got 2 Be Groovin\u2019 came in 2014 and 2016 saw the release of Still Euge, which featured the hit title track as well as memorable vocal appearances from Oleta Adams and Rahsaan Patterson.\n\nEuge Groove further asserts himself as a vital force in the continuum of Contemporary Jazz and promises he has no intentions other than to Groove On! \u201cI\u2019ve really not known anything else. It\u2019s been such an amazing run for the last 30 plus years. From the amazing people I\u2019ve toured in support of to being able to do my own thing, sometimes I\u2019ll reflect and just say \u201cwow!\u201d The places I\u2019ve been and the people I\u2019ve met..it\u2019s like a real life fairy tale at times.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information please contact Monifa Brown (973) 579-7763 EXT 26/mbrown@shanachie.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Danny Ali", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9530211.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "401 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "David Penn", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9401944.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.403705, 37.77731], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "Genres: House, Deep House, Tech House", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "THE ENDUP", "moreBioInfo": "David Penn is an icon in the Spanish Electronic music scene with more than 20 years of successful career.

My anxiety was so bad in college that I had seizures and panic attacks. My brain would just shut down. When I would finally recover, I\u2019d feel the emptiness depression brought shortly after.\u201d\n\nDuring this time, Spencer had begun to write songs with his best friend Zach Lovett and started to understand it\u2019s more than a creative outlet. \u201cThe lowly moments turned into opportunities to write songs.\u201d As their college band dissolved, the two went onto form Young Valley along with Zach\u2019s twin brother Dylan Lovett.\n\n\u201cZach taught me so much about writing songs, and I absorbed everything I could. He had been doing it for much longer and knew what made a song work. He helped me find my voice.\u201d The songwriting team found endless opportunity and took Young Valley on the road.\n\nSpencer dropped out of school, moved back to Jackson, and toured with Young Valley heavily for the next five years playing the drums and singing. \u201cI\u2019d get the Don Henley or the Levon Helm comment all the time. It was hard as hell to learn to play drums and sing at the same time, but I managed. I always wanted to play in a real band.\u201d\n\nAll the while, Thomas had written a few songs in his own time that didn\u2019t fit the mold Young Valley had created. \u201cWe tried some more personal tunes of mine that didn\u2019t come across like it was in my head, so I put them in my back pocket.\u201d As Thomas\u2019s influences matured, he realized the kind of songwriter he wanted to be. \u201cI love guys like Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, and Bruce Springsteen. They took so many risks as songwriters with their sounds changing from record to record. Their creative freedom was astounding.\u201d\n\nAfter Petty\u2019s death late 2017, Spencer decided to book studio dates for the songs he saved up on the side. \u201cWe\u2019re only on this earth for so long. Tom Petty left behind a legacy and songs over a 40 year career and I said \u2018I want to do that.\u2019\u201d Young Valley had just finished the final touches on their self-titled record in Water Valley, Mississippi with Matt Patton (Drive-By Truckers) and Bronson Tew (Fat Possum, Dial Back Sound) who welcomed Thomas in to bring his record to life.\n\nTeaming up with Tew as his producer/engineer/bass player and Young Valley band mates Ethan Frink and Kell Kellum as the rest of the backing band, Hangin\u2019 Tough was tracked in February 2018. \u201cI found my musical identity in this album. It touches on all my influences and my mental struggles. I quote a friend of mine I sent the album to early on.

Oh, and give your music away. Which isn\u2019t to say he won\u2019t be selling his debut full-length offering, Messenger ( Released 2/16/2010 on Lightning Rod). But free is how he came to make it, more or less.\n\nIt worked like this, for Joe Pug anyhow: The day before his senior year as a playwright student at the University of North Carolina, he sat down for a cup of coffee and had the clearest thought of his life: I am profoundly unhappy here. Then came the second clearest.\n\nPug packed up his belongings and pointed his car towards Chicago. Working as a carpenter by day, the 23 year-old Pug spent nights playing the guitar he hadn\u2019t picked up since his teenage years. Using ideas originally slated for a play he was writing called \u201cAustin Fish,\u201d Pug began creating the sublime lyrical arrangements that would become the Nation of Heat EP.\n\nThe songs were recorded fast and fervently at a Chicago studio where a friend snuck him in to late night slots other musicians had canceled. He was short on money, but his bare-boned sincerity didn\u2019t require much more than a microphone and it dripped off of each note he sang.\n\nThe early rumblings of critical praise for the EP were confirmed when his first headlining gig sold out Chicago\u2019s storied Schubas Tavern in 2008. As word spread, Pug struck upon an idea that would later prove to be one of the most significant in his young career. He offered his existing fans unlimited copies of a free 2-song sampler CD to pass along to their friends. He sent the CDs out at his own expense, even covering the postage. Inside each package was a personal note thanking the fan for helping to spread the word. The response was overwhelming, and to date he has sent out over 15,000 CDs to 50 states and 14 different countries. Without access to radio, Pug managed to turn his fans into his very own broadcast system. The offer still stands, and to this day it\u2019s featured prominently on www.joepugmusic.com.\n\n\u201cLook, in the end, I just trust my fans, and the nature of people in general. I need to pay my bills like anyone else does. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to ask someone to pay $15 when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting. So in a way by sending out these CDs, I\u2019m wagering that they\u2019ll like my music, and that if they do they\u2019ll come to shows, buy CDs, and help me spread the word even further. And so far I\u2019ve been proven right. Without question, the more sampler CDs I send out, the more music I sell.\u201d\n\nNation of Heat took on a life of its own, passing from friend to friend and iPod to iPod. The crowds swelled and the media took notice. Tours with Steve Earle, M. Ward, and Josh Ritter followed, as did invitations to Lollapalooza and the Newport Folk Festival. He crisscrossed the country incessantly, traveling mostly alone in his 1995 Plymouth Voyager with no stereo or air conditioning. As the tours went on, he became closely linked to the burgeoning indie-folk scene that was coalescing loosely around Pug and his young contemporaries in bands such as The Low Anthem, Langhorne Slim, and Horse Feathers.\n\nAfter over 200 shows, Pug took a brief respite to record his full-length debut. If Nation of Heat heralded the arrival of a talent to watch, Messenger assigns Pug a deserved spot among the finest songwriters of his generation. From the opening notes of the title track that leads off the record, it\u2019s clear that the artist has no intention of retreating to the comfortable or the familiar. While the scathing war indictment \u201cBury Me Far (From My Uniform)\u201d and the sparse, poetic \u201cUnsophisticated Heart\u201d illustrate that Pug is still a master of the guy-and-guitar song, it\u2019s the supporting cast Pug brought on board that truly brings out the record\u2019s subtle beauty.\n\nFrom the haunting, ethereal pedal steel guitar that sneaks delicately under \u201cThe Sharpest Crown\u201d to the barrelhouse rhythm section that propels \u201cThe Door Is Always Open\u201d, it\u2019s clear that Pug is as comfortable exploring this new territory as he is solo. \u201cThe first record, it was a breeze,\u201d he says. \u201cDidn\u2019t even know we were making it, just me and a guitar\u2026the songs completely unadorned.

All enjoyed some humble acclaim and success one way or another. I acted for a time in the 90's as well (plays, television, movies). Good fun for sure, but my heart lies in music.

Perhaps more importantly, and after over 3 decades molding the Hardcore realm, AGNOSTIC FRONT have protected and nurtured Hardcore music in such a way that it still exists healthily & in its proper form, today. As a band that has cultivated their reputation with honesty, and that prioritizes affirming their social messages to the world, GET LOUD! is well suited as the title for their 12th, full length studio album. Although the sociopolitical climate has transformed considerably since the release of the United Blood EP in 1983, the basic concepts of political corruption and social unrest have only been enhanced, and with them the fuel on AGNOSTIC FRONT\u2019s fire. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a voice; had a lot to say. We\u2019re always screaming for a change\u201d says frontman Roger Miret. \u201cSpeak up, get loud, say what you have to say. Be the change you want to see in the world. You can\u2019t change the whole thing, but you can make little differences that will matter, eventually.\u201d\n\nFor such a memorable album, the reappearance of Cause For Alarm artist Sean Taggart was vital in order to deliver a piece of art that perfectly combined the old school with the current state of the world. Bringing the CFA characters back to life in a new age, the artwork will be familiar to AGNOSTIC FRONT fans the world over, but still maintains a modern freshness. When CFA was initially released in 1986 it was a distinguished and prosperous time for the world of Hardcore, and it is that time, and that vibe, that this album aspires to reassert.\n\nGET LOUD! is compiled of 14 tracks that are nothing short of classic, home grown, NewYork Hardcore, but still includes some thrashy and punky variety. The title track carries a common message for the entire album. It\u2019s a moody and riveting version of \u201cspeak up, aren\u2019t you sick of the same day to day routine? It\u2019s time to make that change and stop climbing up that same exact wall. That\u2019s what GET LOUD! is all about.\u201d says Miret. Songs like \u201c I Remember \u201d are important glimpses into the lives of the men of AGNOSTIC FRONT and thus tie in strongly with their recent release of Ian McFarland\u2019s Documentary: THE GODFATHERS OF HARDCORE (2017). Although it was written after the release of the film, the track serves almost as a theme song for the documentary in which Miret and founding guitarist Vinnie Stigma recall their pasts and their most groundbreaking records; even first meeting one another. Songs like \u201cConquer And Divide\u201d speak to the current state of where we as humans are today. \u201cIt\u2019s like all the government has ever wanted is to divide the people, and then come in and conquer. I see it happening today; social media is a huge let down in that way. Now everyone has a voice, and I get it, but I can\u2019t believe how quickly some people are willing to jump headfirst into something that doesn\u2019t care about them\u201d Miret explains. \u201cPower of expression, power of the mind, freedom of speech, live free or die, stand up and resist, gotta fight to exist, break down the walls that divide.\u201d\n\nThe raw and emotional journey of \u201cTHE GODFATHERS OF HARDCORE\u201d can be\ncredited as having some affect on the course of this record cycle. \u201cIt was nothing like I expected, it was mind blowing because it was SO US\u201d Miret reflects. \u201cIt was pretty incredible to have that, for my family, the future of my family. Put something out there digitally, and it\u2019s out there forever. I\u2019m really happy we never did anything like this, that this is it. It will hold through the tests of time. It\u2019s not just a movie about punk, or hardcore, or metal, it\u2019s about humanity and it\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nAn old school band in a new era can be an adjustment, but there\u2019s something to be said for the technological advances that have enabled AGNOSTIC FRONT to write this new album, even with distances between the core members of the band. Ideas, lyrics, and riffs were tossed around amongst the guys in a digital universe, and once solid skeletons were formed, the final portion of the writing, the finessing, and the recording began in person. Produced by Miret himself, longtime friend Paul Miner of Buzz Bomb Studios then tracked, recorded, mixed, and mastered the album. GET LOUD! is now arranged, groomed, and ready to make its debut to fans the world over.\n\n\u201cSomething real. I think that\u2019s the secret to our longevity. People see us, and they see something that\u2019s real and genuine, and they want to be a part of that. Who wants to be a part of something that\u2019s fake?

During that time I was invited to audition for a TV show called \"The Voice.\" I went on a whim and was asked to audition again in Los Angeles, this time in front of famous people. Next thing I knew I was face to face with Christina Aguilera and Adam Levine, talking about songwriting among other things, and 12 million people saw it on NBC. I was on the show for a couple episodes, left in a fashion that I am very comfortable with and since then I've been back on the road, doing what I've been doing for the past four -- almost five, now -- years. It's been great to see some new friendly faces at these shows, as well as having a chance to reconnect with the familiar ones. If you'd like to see me play live sometime, check out my tour schedule. I hope to slow down for a minute to record some new songs sometime soon, but I've always got a tour cookin, so keep an eye out!

When the band went on hiatus, Armould channeled his energy into American Field Day, which walks the stylistic line between rock n roll and Americana. Fans of Whiskeytown, Jason Isbell and the Avett Brothers will find a lot to like in the melodic, dynamic songs of AFD.\n\nIn the summer of 2019 Armould recorded his first EP in Nashville, TN with the guidance of producer Bill Reynolds of Band of Horses. He was backed by a stellar band that included Carl Broemel (My Morning Jacket) on guitars and Robbie Crowell (Deer Tick, Midland) on bass and keys. It was a heady beginning for a songwriter who is still finishing his last year of high school, but Armould rose to the occasion and the result is a self titled EP that is marked as much by his melodic songwriting as it his trademark voice.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2369 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "PICANTE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.434352, 37.762839], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Picante\" w/ DJ Marco & guest DJs"}, {"Address": "2369 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "PICANTE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.434352, 37.762839], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Picante\" w/ DJ Marco & guest DJs"}, {"Address": "1522 Francisco Blvd, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "John Rybak", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9513816.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.49051, 37.636718], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Americana", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Winters Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "John is an established professional musical performer and plays acoustic shows around the San Francisco area.

Preston & The Loaded Pistols\u201d and released a full length album, \u201cThe Colt From Old Regret.\u201d The addition of two integral members in 2013 and 2015 gave Sean the audacious sound he was searching for.\n\nChristopher \u201cSparky\u201d Spiridigliozzi went from beating on trash cans as a kid growing up in Hampton, VA to drumming and singing in gigging garage rock bands by the time he was 16. Sparky taught himself guitar during his time in the US Navy and eventually made his way to Baltimore where he spent 7 years playing guitar and singing as the frontman for Mother Jefferson. After building a career in radio and raising a family, Sparky went back to drums full time playing for numerous Baltimore based garage, surf, and punk bands. When he is not touring, Sparky is expertly repairing vintage drum kits at Baltimore\u2019s most reputable drum shop or writing and recording for his solo musical project, Sparky\u2019s BUTTERKNIFE.\n\nCory McGrath was raised on Black Sabbath and Bad Company in the military town of Browns Mills, NJ. His love for playing music began with drums, but he would later go on to play upright bass for 8 years with Full Blown Cherry. Cory\u2019s style is heavily influenced by the sounds of 1960\u2019s garage rock and high octane country. He currently resides in Philadelphia, PA. When Cory isn\u2019t playing music on the road you can find him hunched over his 1944 Chevy project in the garage or driving around in his 1976 Ford Torino.\n\nSean K. Preston & The Loaded Pistols have appeared on stage at Muddy Roots Festival, Westport Roots Festival, and Crooked Smile. They spent this past winter in the studio recording their upcoming album and shooting music videos.

Over the last couple of years, the man originally turned on to the dance by Derrick Carter has fomented his own groove driven, emotive brand of house that now resonates around the world. Turning heads right from the off were his compilations on Deep Down and Defected, which found Sonny adding his remix flair to a bunch of classics, and after that came sophomore effort After Parties & Aeroplanes. Again a collaborative affair featuring the likes of Doorly, Gene Farris and Cajmere, it was a more jacking, sharp-edged treat designed for maximum dance floor impact, but was also stuffed with unforgettable vocals that agin saw Sonny stepping up his game.\n\n2016 saw the already influential artist stepping up yet again, this time by making his brilliant entry into the hallowed Defected In the House series. His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "Limited Tier 2 Tickets left...\nTable Reservations: BottleService@1015.com // 415-988-3099"}, {"Address": "138 Minna St, San Francisco, CA 94105", "Artist": "Groove Theory", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.400427, 37.787042], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, Soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "John Colins", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Groove Theory\" w/ DJ Natural"}, {"Address": "1539 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "House-Love", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.414361, 37.771234], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Wish", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "House Love | 4th Tuesdays at Wish House Love Monthly w/ STOA + LAUS"}, {"Address": "424 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Bubble", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8065051.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.429362, 37.772531], "Date": "Thu Oct 24 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-24", "Genre": "Genres: Psytrance, Psy Trance/goa Trance, Electronic", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Underground SF", "moreBioInfo": "Follow Bubble www.soundcloud.com/bubble-music www.youtube.com/bubblexmusic", "otherInfo": "\"Bubble\" at Underground SF: This small, dark, and unpretentious Lower Haight spot attempts to inject a subversive element back into the nightclub scene - and, for the most part, it succeeds.

Boo! became not only one of South Africa's favorite bands of all time, but also one of the country's proudest musical exports to both Europe and North America.\n\nIn 7 years Boo! acquired an enormous cult following worldwide by performing 800 gigs in 17 countries, including 14 states in the USA as well as countries such as Hungary and Croatia. Bradishing their self-styled genre of \"monkipunk\", Boo! performed at various European and American festivals with the likes of the White Stripes, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Franz Ferdinand, Smashing Pumpkins, and Coldplay amongst others. The band also received a South African Music Award (SAMA) in 2002 for 'Best Pop Album'.\n\nThe band's sound consisted of bass, drums, brass, keyboards and percussion; notably lacking guitar. In spite of this unusual orchestration, Boo! hit the number one position on the 5FM top 40 with \"Stagefright\" and a number two position with \"OOAA\" - testimony to frontman, bassist and occasional drag queen, Chris Chameleon's exceptional songwriting abilities.\n\nIn September 2004, Ampie Omo and Leon Retief announced their resignation from Boo! and performed their final show with the band on 14 September 2004. Leon Retief continued his career behind the scenes in the South African Music Industry while Ampie Omo continued his career as a member of ska-outfit Fuzigish and was the invited guest trombonist of the Violent Femmes when they played in South Africa in 2005 and 2007. Chris Chameleon surprised his punk pundits and cohorts by becoming one of the best-selling and critically acclaimed artists in the Afrikaans music landscape, notching up at total of 20 national awards in 5 years including two South African Music Awards (SAMA) and a Medal of Honor from the South African Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\n2010 saw Boo! emerge again with a change in wardrobe and drummers with Riaan van Rensburg picking up the sticks on drums. The band set up camp in Amsterdam, The Netherlands early in the year to record the new album \"THE THREE OF US\". On their return, a limited edition run of albums was released for sale at gigs only. The album has since been completely remixed by Neal Snyman with audio approval of award-winning producer Theo Crous (Parlotones, Prime Circle, etc) and remastered by Jonathan Crossley.\n\nBoo! won Suckfree Radio's \"Greatest Unsigned Band in the World\" competition in September 2010 just before signing to Seed, a division of Sheer Sound. The remixed and remastered \"THE THREE OF US\" album was released by Seed in South Africa in early October 2010 followed by a spectacular launch at Montecasino on October 15 2010. The album has already spawned a hit single \"The Three of Us\", which climbed the charts across South African radio and the current single \"To Do Today\" is doing the same.\n\n2011 is set to be the Year of the Boo!", "otherInfo": "18 AND OVER ONLY"}, {"Address": "1539 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "BACK & FORTH", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/292498.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414361, 37.771234], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 AM", "Venue": "Wish", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Back & Forth W/ Resident Jayvi Velasco"}, {"Address": "300 College Ave, Los Gatos, CA 95030", "Artist": "Brother Spellbinder", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8749047.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.98408, 37.215301], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Folk, Alternative", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "Testarossa Winery", "moreBioInfo": "Brother Spellbinder plays well-crafted songs with old world ache and modern angst.

No current band embodies the spirit of metal\u2019s immersive culture with more fervour and might than Amon Amarth: Sweden\u2019s celebrated Viking overlords and undisputed modern masters of epic heavy metal.Today, Amon Amarth stand tall and unassailable: over 25 years into a career that has seen them evolve from humble origins in the dark, dank rehearsal rooms of their native Tumba to their current status as explosive festival headliners and one of the metal world\u2019s most widely adored bands. Their most recent album, 2015\u2019s Jomsviking, hit the #1 spot in Germany\u2019s official album chart and swiftly became their most successful worldwide release to date. As a result, Amon Amarth are very much at the height of their powers as they prepare to return to action in 2019, with their biggest, boldest and most bombastic musical statement to date.Formed in 1992, Amon Amarth became modern metal greats the hard way. Ruthlessly dedicated to creating new music and taking it out on the road, the Swedes steadily built a formidable reputation as a ferocious live band and, as the years passed, were increasingly recognised for their recorded achievements too. Since the dawn of the millennium, Amon Amarth have been unstoppable. Breakthrough releases like 2006\u2019s With Oden On Our Side and its now legendary follow-up, 2008\u2019s Twilight Of The Thunder God, further cemented their popularity throughout the metal world, while the band\u2019s stage show evolved with each successive tour, transforming into one of modern metal\u2019s truly great spectacles. All of this and more has been captured in the band\u2019s recent live DVD and documentary, The Pursuit Of Vikings: 25 Years In The Eye Of The Storm, which put a stylish seal on one of modern music\u2019s most unlikely success stories.Meanwhile, in 2019, Amon Amarth \u2013completed by vocalist Johan Hegg, guitarists Olavi Mikkonen and Johan S\u00f6derberg, bassist Ted Lundstr\u00f6m and drummer Jocke Wallgren -know that expectations for their next move are at an all-time high. The excellent news is that the band\u2019s 11th studio album, the aptly-named Berserker, is guaranteed to have all discerning metal fans punching the air with joy. Comprising 12 monstrous Viking metal anthems that bulge with irresistible melodic hooks, bursts of thrilling savagery and moments of spine-tingling dynamic drama, it\u2019s the results of the huge surge of creativity and a collective desire to keep moving forward with no compromise.\u201cThe previous album was a concept album but we didn\u2019t want to get into a situation where every album has to be a concept record, so this is different,\u201d states Johan. \u201cWe wanted to step away from that and look at being a little bit more diverse, with the lyrics and everything else. I got ideas from lots of different things,from history stuff and mythological sources. Sometimes you just get something in your head and there doesn\u2019t have to be a bigger meaning behind it \u2013sometimes it\u2019s just a great metal lyric that fits with a great metal song. And these are fucking great metal songs!\u201dFrom the disarming melodrama and explosive riffing of opener Fafner\u2019s Gold and the brutish simplicity of the rampaging Crack The Sky to the epic fury of Raven\u2019s Flight and the grim, gritty storytelling of Ironside and Skoll and Hati, Berserkeris an album full of trademark Amon Amarth bluster and bite, but with every aspect of the band\u2019s sound somehow refined, sonically enhanced and made vastly more potent, both in terms of metal oomph and emotional power. Neatly summing up the spirit behind these exhilarating new songs is the album\u2019s semi-title track, The Berserker At Stamford Bridge: a visceral but vivid historical tale, recounting the Vikings last stand against the English army in 1066 and the mind-bending heroics of one axe-wielding warrior.\u201cThe Vikings were cut off from their supply ships, so they had to retreat over Stamford Bridge, with the whole English army hard on their heels,\u201d Johan notes. \u201cThe Vikings sent just one man out on the bridge to hold the whole English army back, about 15,000 men. So this guy, equipped with a Dane Axe, I think he killed between 40 and 70 people before they got him. And the only way they could get him was to send four guys onto the river on a raft, and they got him from beneath with spears! So it\u2019s the perfect story for a great metal song.\u201dShowcasing an undeniable and startling upgrade for every aspect of Amon Amarth\u2019s iconic sound, Berserker was recorded in Los Angeles with renowned studio guru Jay Ruston (Anthrax/Stone Sour/Steel Panther) manning the controls. After recording several rounds of professional demos for the new songs (initially with fellow Swedish metal icon Peter T\u00e4gtgren and then later with Ruston himself) the band crossed the Atlantic to make final recordings in LA, eager to take a fresh approach to the album-making process.\u201cWorking with Jay was great,\u201d Johan recalls. \u201cThe studio was amazing, and Jay\u2019s methodology was new to us -he suggested that we record one song at a time, so that you can go back and change things and then it\u2019s easy because everything is already set up. It was interesting, and we had a great time.\u201dEmboldened by their recent triumphs and unerring longevity, Amon Amarth return in 2019 with Odin\u2019s breath billowing their sails with more strength than ever before. Encapsulating everything that fans love about the band while boldly stepping into new territory, Berserker is a career-best tour-de-force from 21st century metal\u2019s most dedicated foot-soldiers. The march to glory continues!\u201cFor me, this is Amon Amarth 2.0. I think what we\u2019ve done here is give ourselves the space to explore other parts of our musicality and who we are as a band. If you\u2019re content with where you\u2019re at, what\u2019s the point of continuing? We always want to come up with new ideas and find new ways of doing things and to create bigger and better shows and really try to improve every aspect of what the band is. We want to try to keep growing and to do this for as long as we have the possibility to do so, because this is the best fucking job in the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "91 S Autumn St, San Jose, CA 95110", "Artist": "Shane Dwight", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8999662.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.900379, 37.329579], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Southern Rock, Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Poor House Bistro", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2001 Gayley Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720", "Artist": "Erykah Badu", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8653194.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.25063, 37.86976], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: R&b/soul, Soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Hearst Greek Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Mos Def's Black on Both Sides 20th Anniversary Concert featuring: Erykah Badu Slick Rick Souls Of Mischief DJ Big Von Plus Surprise Special Guests"}, {"Address": "122 N Main St, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "The Musers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8182687.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.824579, 38.402405], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "People's Music", "moreBioInfo": "Free Range folk from Sonoma County\nThe Musers are Anita Bear Sandwina, and Megan McLaughlin both Multi-instrumentalists and award winning song-writers, accompanied by Tom Kuhn on stand up Bass.

As the Truth or Consequences, NM-based \u2018Harmonic Alternative Folk\u2019 duo Flagship Romance they live, work, and annually travel tens of thousands of miles together, deeply in love with each other and the process of bringing their emotionally powerful music to the people. It is an inspiring union of hearts, minds and souls that entrances all who encounter them and their art.\n\n\"Their songs & vocals have a simmering intensity... I also suspect Fisher used to play in rock bands, as he tended to attack his guitar with an unbridled ferociousness.\" - Mayer Danzig // Twangville\n\nFluent, intense acoustic guitar playing; lyrics of life\u2019s peaks, troughs, mysteries and wonders; soaring, yearning vocals; tender, though oft-anthemic melodies, and harmonies one could barely separate with a single human hair: this is the Flagship Romance sound. Live, sharing a custom-built dual microphone stand, they deliver their beautiful material with passionate abandon, living each song as if it will be the last they will ever perform. Such commitment to their music and stagecraft has, in just a few short years, seen the aptly-monikered Flagship Romance become huge favourites of the North American house concert circuit. This suits them just fine, as Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s preferred performance scenario is an intimate venue where the audience is tucked up close enough to them that they can hear them breathe (and, unfailingly, gasp at Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s chemistry and dynamics). Yet they have also appeared at festivals, clubs and concert halls, sharing stages with international acts including Half Moon Run, Iris DeMent, Mason Jennings and the Goo Goo Dolls.\n\nFlagship Romance are on the road for upwards of eight months a year, and have been pretty much since the release of their 2013 debut EP, The Fudge Sessions. If ever a testament to this extraordinary work ethic were needed, it would be the reaction to the crowdfunding campaign they launched to finance their 2014 full-length debut, an ambitious and ultimately stunning CD/DVD project entitled Fee Fie Foh Fum. Recorded live off the floor \u2013 difficult to comprehend considering its quality \u2013 the album captures the bristling energy of Flagship Romance live shows, and was created with the considerable backing of the duo\u2019s rapidly burgeoning legion of fans, to the tune of over $25,000.\n\nOn the back of such a successful project, one that emphatically delivered on their promises, a sophomore full-length was hotly anticipated. Lo and behold, another overwhelmingly positive Kickstarter campaign ensured that Flagship Romance could craft 2017\u2019s Tales from the Self-Help Section exactly as they wished to, employing a subtly richer sound and new vocal approaches by Jordyn. Produced by Lucio Rubino at The Fish Tank Recordings in St. Augustine, FL, Tales from the Self-Help Section is a personal, largely self-examining and emotional 12-song opus, documenting \u201cthe little victories, failures and lessons\u201d Shawn and Jordyn have experienced during the last couple of years, \u201cmostly dealing with the battles of \u2018being present,\u2019 and living with depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nOn the evidence of their gorgeous work to date it is clear that the love and skill of which John Ruskin spoke intertwine in perfect harmony in the cases of Shawn Fisher and Jordyn Jackson, and that, indeed, little masterpieces are the results. Yes, Ruskin would have loved Flagship Romance.\n\n......\n\nFlagship Romance has aligned their musical career with the clean water cause via the organization charity: water. In August 2012, Fisher and Jackson founded and organized the Clean Water Music Fest in Florida, to raise funding and awareness for the 800 million people on this planet without access to safe, clean drinking water. Since then, they have raised over $125,000; 100% of that money is currently being used for well building and tap-stand projects in Ethiopia, Rwanda, and the Sahel region of Africa.\n\nBiography by David Morrison, Folk Radio UK", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "44 Race St, San Jose, CA 95126", "Artist": "Simon Lunche", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8507699.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.911581, 37.330495], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Pop Rock, singer songwriter, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Art Boutiki", "moreBioInfo": "Singer/songwriter Simon Lunche has packed a near-lifetime of musical experience into just 21 years. As the creative force behind Berkeley-based indie-rock act The Blondies, he\u2019s written and produced the band\u2019s entire catalog and made his name as a captivating live performer. Along with taking up guitar at age five\u2014and soon becoming the youngest endorsed artist in the history of Gibson Guitars\u2014he\u2019s built up a vast musical knowledge that includes composing all the instrumental parts to his songs, from violin and cello to trumpet and sax. Having spent the last decade as a frontman, Lunche is now set to deliver a solo debut that brings a powerful new depth and even more dynamic vision to his artistry.\n\nFormed when Lunche was nine-years-old, The Blondies released their acclaimed album Just Another Evening in June 2016, right around the time of his high school graduation. While several of the band\u2019s older members decided to focus on finishing up college, Lunche opted to forgo school and pursue music full-time. Despite having written the majority of The Blondies\u2019 three EPs and full-length effort all on his own, Lunche quickly found that working as a solo artist allowed a greater degree of creative freedom and sparked an unexpected evolution in his sound.\n\n\u201cAs I started working on my new music, I rediscovered the reason why I picked up guitar in the first place,\u201d says Lunche, who recalls hearing an Eric Clapton solo at five-years-old and instantly becoming infatuated with guitar. Expanding on the technique he\u2019d begun sharpening as a little kid, Lunche soon advanced from his former role as rhythm guitarist and started crafting more intricate and richly textured guitar lines. \u201cI don\u2019t go for that shred-happy stuff that\u2019s going to blow the roof off,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me it\u2019s more about slower, smoother playing and more melodic lines that really stay with you in a special way.\u201d\n\nAs he settled into finding his voice as a lead guitarist, Lunche conjured up a guitar lick that would make its way into his solo debut single. Mixed by Grammy Award-winning engineer Dave Reitzas (who\u2019s previously worked with artists ranging from Barbra Streisand to The Weeknd), \u201cAn Angel\u2019s Love\u201d bears a warm authenticity shaped by Lunche\u2019s longtime love of Van Morrison and Leonard Cohen. The piano-driven track also finds Lunche bringing deeper nuance and a more reflective mood to his lyrics. \u201cI think as you get older, you start to appreciate these little moments in time in a way you maybe never had before,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of what I\u2019m writing right now is about dealing with change and trying to move forward, but still holding onto some reminiscence of the past.\u201d\n\nThroughout his forthcoming album, Lunche matches his classic sensibilities with a soulful vitality that adds a fresh new edge to his music. At the same time, his solo work shows the strength of his natural musicality (a factor possibly inherited from his grandfather Raymond V. Pepe, who\u2014as president of the Institute of High Fidelity\u2014was hailed by Frank Sinatra for his sonic ingenuity). In each track, Lunche builds off his instincts with the songwriting skills he\u2019s honed since age six. He also sculpts every song with intense precision, tapping into his constant studying of the complexities of production. \u201cWhen I listen to music, I\u2019m thinking about how certain sounds were made, what gear was used and how things were recorded,\u201d he says. \u201cExperimenting in the studio all the time has really helped me to fine-tune my own sound and create music that feels good to me.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working on his solo material, Lunche is often immersed in his long-term project of composing his own symphony: further proof of his restless creativity and singular devotion to making music. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see me, I\u2019m probably writing some piece of music or working on finding some sound\u2014to the point where if I try to wind down a little at the end of the night, after about two minutes I\u2019m picking up my guitar and trying to figure out some tone,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic is 100 percent my life, and there\u2019s really nothing that can ever distract me from it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Kid Bloom", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9240380.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bottom of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "Kid Bloom is an American funky, pop, rock band from Studio City, California.

A dynamic woman with a powerful life story, Karyn is the eldest daughter of Orlando Magic Senior Vice President & Founder, Pat Williams. Her international family includes nineteen children, fourteen of which are adopted from all over the world. After graduating from the University of Florida with a degree in Broadcast Journalism, Karyn felt a calling to head to Nashville to pursue a career in music. \u201cMy dad always taught us through his example to be your own person, don\u2019t be afraid to take huge risks, and then trust God with the results.\u201d Armed with nothing more than big dreams, a trusting heart, and unrelenting determination, Karyn took the leap of faith and left home. In the Fall of 2011, Karyn signed a major label record deal with Inpop Records becoming label mates with the Newsboys, Jaci Velasquez & Matt Kearney, and released her first full length studio album Only You in 2012. Only You is a collection of songs that are more like pages from a diary reflecting on the amazing journey she has been on. Written with some of Nashville\u2019s best songwriters (Sarah Hart, Ben Glover, Brian White, Barry Weeks) it is a project that reflects her heart in every way and the record\u2019s lead single Rest In The Hope spent more than 30 weeks on the charts.

It\u2019s her desire to encourage people with the good news of God\u2019s grace and mercy. Her unrelenting trust in God provides the foundation for her life and is woven throughout every song she sings. \u201cAll I\u2019ve ever wanted to do is write and sing songs that encourage people and share hope.

Her new CD is due out in September of 2015 and includes a duet with fellow CCM artist Danny Gokey. Never one to sit still for very long, Williams recently wrapped up the filming of her first movie, The Power of the Air set for release in 2016, she made her Grand Ole Opry debut in December 2014 at the historic Ryman Auditorium, and added her vocals to the newly released Third Day album, singing a duet with Mac Powell on Born Again.

From becoming the first ever duo to win the World #1 DJ\u2019s crown at the prestigious DJ Mag Top 100 DJs Poll in 2015, the twosome continued to stand strong and remain relevant amongst the ever-changing landscape of modern dance music, with a supremely high placing at #2 in the 2016 edition of the Poll.\n\nWhether wreaking havoc across Europe, Asia, Australia, North or South America, ripping up the music charts with immense studio releases, cutting huge remixes for the A-list elite or playing their part in the incredible rise of the Belgian mega-festival Tomorrowland, the award-winning brotherly duo have now become the leading lights in the new wave of not only international dance music currently taking the planet by storm, but also turning their hand to craft a slew of chart climbing pop-dance hits over the past 12 months.\n\nPicking up heavy support from top industry figures like Apple\u2019s Beats 1\u2019s host Zane Lowe, BBC Radio 1\u2019s Pete Tong and Danny Howard, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike have fast become one of the go-to acts for major recording artists from remixing Lady Gaga, over to scoring edits for everyone from Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull, Snoop Dogg, Sean Paul, Ne-Yo and plenty more.\n\nTheir electrifying live combination of DJ sets and crowd-busting MCing has propelled them towards party notoriety, scooping the hotly contested \u2018Best Breakthrough Act\u2019 award at the 2013 International Dance Music Awards (IMDAs) and back-to-back \u2018Best European DJ\u2019s\u2019 awards in 2014 & 2015, the pair also later won 'Best European DJ\u2019 & 'Best Artist Group' in the 2016 edition of the IDMA\u2019s. The brothers won \u2018Best Global DJ\u2019 at the 2015 edition of the EMPO TV awards in Mexico and repeated the triumph again in 2016, as well as winning \u2018Best Big Room\u2019 and \u2018Best Music Video\u2019 for their unmissable music video The Hum. They\u2019ve also since been two-time winners of the MTV EMA for \u2018Best Belgian Act\u2019 as now-classics including \u2018The Hum\u2019, \u2018Mammoth\u2019, \u2018Tremor\u2019, \u2018Eat, Sleep, Rave, Repeat\u2019 and the recent Billboard-premiered Summer anthem \u2018Stay A While\u2019, ensures that the boys continue to sound as originally exciting as the day these seminal tracks were first unleashed.\n\nWith their unique arena-smashing brand of entertainment the duo have become constant headline features at the planet\u2019s biggest and most prestigious stages week in, week out, including holding residency at the luxurious Hakkasan Las Vegas since the beginning of 2015. Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike have also held down one of the most in-demand, hand-curated events in recent Ibiza memory, taking over the Amnesia Terrace every Sunday with their unique \u2018House of Madness\u2019 party. Merging together a truly manic clubbing concept of the Summer\u2019s biggest anthems that returned once more for a run of sell-out events in 2016, previous guest sets from Diplo, Steve Angelo, Fat Boy Slim, Armin Van Buuren, Steve Aoki, Yves V and more assured that \u2018House of Madness\u2019 has certainly cemented itself as a modern event for the Ibiza history books.\n\nFrom legendary clubs like Pacha Ibiza and NYC to Mansion in Miami, London\u2019s Ministry of Sound and Brazil\u2019s #1 epic Green Valley club, to festival main stages including Mysteryland, EDC Las Vegas, EDC UK, Ultra Music Festival, and Creamfields plus many, many more, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike regularly illuminate the top billboards of the hottest tickets around including most prominently, the world\u2019s biggest and best festival Tomorrowland of which the duo have been official residents of for over 6 years, bringing their killer anthems to a main stage audience of hundreds of thousands yearly.\n\nWhilst their presence across the arena circuit is something to behold and testament to this statement is the soaring number of views that their first ever solo \u2018Bringing Home The Madness\u2019 event has achieved to date with almost 21 million YouTube views and counting, the event itself selling over 36,000 tickets making it \u201cone of the country\u2019s most impressive shows\u201d, later adding a second chapter with three massive sold-out arena spectacles in Belgium & Mexico City. In 2015 the brothers\u2019 broke records again when all 40,000 tickets for their next run of \u2018Bringing The Madness 3.0\u2019 shows at Belgium's most legendary venue - Sportpaleis Antwerpen - sold out in under 40 minutes and for their next memorable chapter, it didn\u2019t stop there. Constantly pushing boundaries and wanting to give their fans the most immersive experience, the brothers announced another \u2018Bringing The Madness\u2019 extravaganza for December 2016 that obliterated their previous records selling 60,000 tickets in 60 minutes; a feat previously only managed by legendary names such as U2, Madonna, Coldplay, Beyonc\u00e9, and Michael Jackson, as they also take the extravaganza to Germany\u2019s World Club Dome this November.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pick-up from the overwhelming fan support generated is as impressive as both their touring and release schedules, with the duo amassing 8 million Facebook likes, over 2.4 million Twitter followers collectively, 2.4 million Instagram fans and in excess of 455.5 million YouTube views across their videos, the global phenomenon of the brothers is undeniable. Their smash hit \u2018The Hum\u2019 netted them the #1 single spot in their native Belgium going platinum, a feat that was repeated just a few months later with their \u2018Higher Place\u2019 collaboration penned with R&B superstar Ne-Yo, which spent an astonishing 10 weeks atop the singles chart in their home country. The track also went on to secure the #1 Billboard Dance Chart spot, furthermore picking up a trend as one of the most Shazamed tracks at festivals including Tomorrowland, TomorrowWorld, Ultra Miami and Creamfields \u2013 but Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike are never one to conform to standard practice and continue to push the envelope of their musical scope. This was proven when the bothers, alongside previous collaborators Steve Aoki and Ummet Ozcan, were chosen to produce the official Belgian Red Devils Euro 2016 football anthem \u2018Melody\u2019, a boisterous, explosive track primed to get the team and spectators suitably revved up for the globally-watched competition. With another Tomorrowland-premiered release \u2018Hey Baby\u2019 alongside heavyweight Diplo set for release this October, tongues ae already wagging in anticipation across the blogsphere as plays at Serbia\u2019s EXIT Festival and ADE this year, ensure fans are waiting with baited breath for this next, no-doubt, stellar hit.\n\nNever ones to slow down, their consistently excellent placing within the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs Poll has only seen the duo propelled to even greater heights. Their relentless drive to continually provide their solid and loyal fanbase with even greater and more exciting shows, music, and madness, is likely to see Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike ascend even beyond the top tier of the electronic music scene. Their appeal and genuine love for what they do has been behind the impressive accolades the brothers have received so far, and they\u2019re only just getting started.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Dave Sampson Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9062126.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Dave Sampson is a freelance guitarist, producer, multi-instrumtentalist and music instructor.

In June 2018, East Forest was invited to Maui to record brand new teachings from Ram Dass. After capturing these words of wisdom East Forest returned to his studio to compose the soundtrack to beautifully support each songs\u2019 subject. Covering topics such as dark thoughts, nature, the soul and so much more, these songs are full of inspiration. The album will release in four \u201cchapters\u201d throughout 2019, culminating in a full length release on August 9, 2019. Trevor Hall and grammy nominated artist, Krishna Das are among the featured artists who make guest appearances on the 14-track album.\n\n\u201cEast Forest is tied to both nature and to everyday urban life, giving it the qualities of a sort of ethereal and mystical modern-day fairytale. It\u2019s just blissful.\u201d (NPR)\n\nEast Forest is a unique bird in the Wild West aviaries of electronic music and the field of wellness. While his \u2018shamanic ambient electro-acoustic pop\u2019 can be contextualized along with Aphex Twin, Philip Glass and Sigur Ros, the fundamental mission of his project is to create sonic architecture for others to explore their inner space. Thus, it is a process of opening doorways for the listener to walk through \u2014 whether through his music, talks, retreats or other myriad offerings \u2014 which invites patience. Patience, while typically thought of as kryptonite in the instant gratification, hyper-speed world of music and modern life, might just be the medicine we need.\n\nNature indelibly made a huge impression on East Forest, who grew up in the Pacific Northwest. He spent a decade in NYC, where he discovered indigenous traditions and their relationship to both sound and ceremony. Eventually he started leading underground ceremonies across the country as he began cultivating his own source recordings from sound healings and therapeutic mushroom ceremonies. Playing in the shadows allowed the patient sound of East Forest to emerge: an emotional and spacious lexicon born out of a practical need to play solo for six hours, and a need to develop a protocol and musical landscape to guide a room full of listeners in deep meditation.\n\n\u201cFull of rich bass, introspective soundscapes, the biophany of nature, and live instrumentation ranging from a wooden flute to a mylodica, East Forest doesn\u2019t just create sound, he creates narrative.\u201d (Huffington Post)\n\nWord organically spread as a devoted community shared his early albums, leading to glowing nods of approval from the likes of NPR and Wired. He completed multiple tours across the U.S. and Europe and shared his mission on the stage of TEDx while performing in a wide range of settings, from SXSW to Grace Cathedral. As his diverse catalogue emerged (15 releases total), the music evolved from extended, ambient soundscapes to more concise, structured material with vocals \u2013 a vivid mix of the digital and analog realms with a social and spiritual underpinning. \u201cI\u2019ve always been inspired by the natural world and the psychedelic experience as curative tools\u201d East Forest asserts, which he has often implemented in his live recording process. \u201cI prefer to operate where my intuitive musical mind can speak and something larger can come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe music is a beautiful wash of violin drones, piano and wordless vocals.\u201d (Paste)\n\nAs a teacher, East Forest has trail-blazed a path in the wellness movement building bridges between the digital and natural worlds. As a leader in the burgeoning field of \u201corganic tech\u201d, he continually cross pollinates his work to bring together diverse fields to explore the intersection between technology, nature and the human experience \u2014 with a brain-body approach aimed towards secular yet deeply spiritual personal development; a methodology grounded as much in science as in ritual and ceremony. His collaborations include Google, Esalen Institute, Consciousness Hacking, and Science And Nonduality (SAND) among others, in addition to his weekly podcast series that offers discussions with thought leaders alongside musically guided original meditations.\n\n\u201cImmersive and vivid\u201d (Wired)\n\n2019 will also see the release of a new long-form East Forest album, \u201cMusic For Mushrooms: A Soundtrack For The Psychedelic Practitioner\u201d (May 2019), a remarkable 5-hour fully connected album experience designed to act as a \u2018digital shaman\u2019 and musically guide the psilocybin (the active ingredient in psychoactive mushrooms) experience in the rapidly progressing drug research studies occurring around the world.

The small crowds brains collectively exploded! \"Who are these two guys?\" \"Why are they so....\" \"So...\" D ciple: so.. the D: well you fill in the adjective... but at that very first show there was a PECULIAR looking fellow, one David Cross, who said he enjoyed our little fandango and invited us to play a comedy show with him n some friends in Hwood, and that would be the Diamond Club, doing a series of shows with Host Laura Milligan and such guest stars as Ben Stiller and Jeaneane Garafalo to name but a few. D ciple: just a few. the d: of course. our little posse began what was to termed for better or worse the \"alternative\" comedy movement, but The D was more, much more. The D began to headline Comedy Night first at Pedros.

D ciple: into flames? the D: anyone who was witness to the original HBO TV show was treated to nothing less than an entertainment revolution: Jack Black and Kyle Gass have arrived to change the way we listen to sound to change the way we thought. D ciple: think? the D: to change the way we might eat a delicious meal. D ciple: indeed. the D: but integrity came first as it always does with the D, and all parties had to part ways. the show that replaced the D? oh I don't know if you've heard of a little show called THE SOPRANOS! D ciple: hmmm...the 3 tenors? the D: well Jack n Kyle had something to prove now. D ciple: and? the D: so they staged a bidding war, signed with Epic Records, made a record with some wickedly talented dudes: Dave Grohl, Page from Phish, Warren from the Vandals, Steve from Redd Kross and the Dust Bros. in the production seat. D ciple: due Sept. 25th....... the D: then Spumco, the creators of Ren & Stimpy, made a rockin' animated music video for their favorite love song.

From his first record, Sparrow's Point (1992) to his current release, Careless (September 2016), Shindell has explored the possibilities offered by this most elastic and variable of cultural confections: the song.\n\nThe path that led him to songwriting was both circuitous and direct. Taking up the guitar at the age of eight, he listened but imagined that composing a song was out of the question.\n\nAfter college and a nine month stint in a Zen Buddhist community in Upstate New York, he headed to Europe with his guitar, finding something not approaching a livelihood performing in the Paris Metro, where he discovered \"I loved the acoustics in those tunnels, but only when they were empty.\"\n\nUpon running out of money he entered Union Theological Seminary, where the celestial acoustics of the chapel inspired his first \"keeper\" composition: On a Sea of Fleur de Lis. Ostensibly a paean to the Virgin Mary, the song marked his rupture from the church and the beginning of his creative life. Its underlying themes - immanence and transcendence, human love and divine love, the particular and the general - have continued to resonate through subsequent work, right up to the present. In many ways, his new album Careless, represents a further exploration of those ideas.\n\nJoining the songwriter scene in New York City led to a deal with Shanachie Records for Shindell\u2019s first three albums: Sparrows Point (1992), Blue Divide (1994), and Reunion Hill (1997). The latter, produced by multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell, won the AFIM (NAIRD) award for \"Best Contemporary Folk Album\" in 1998. Its title track was covered by Joan Baez on her 1997 release, Gone From Danger. In 1998, Shindell joined forces with his friends Dar Williams and Lucy Kaplansky to make CryCryCry (Razor and Tie), a collection of covers. The group toured in support of this highly acclaimed album, leaving audiences spellbound by their gorgeous three-part harmonies.\n\nBy then Shindell was beginning to stretch out as a harmony singer, guitarist and performer. In 1999, Shindell released a live band album, Courier (Signature Sounds) that remains a fan favorite. The year 2000 brought the release of a new collection of originals, Somewhere Near Paterson (Signature Sounds), produced by Campbell. That year also saw a major life-change: with his Argentine wife and their two small children, Shindell moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Taking a few years to get acclimated and learn the language, in 2004 he followed up with Vuelta (Koch Records), joining with Argentine band Puente Celeste. The decade's next release was a collection of covers, South of Delia (2007), Shindell's first foray into production. More than simply a cover record, the song-selections and performances of South of Delia were that of an expatriate looking back at the country and culture he moved away from. His next collection of original songs, Not Far Now, was released by Signature Sounds in 2009. For 13 Songs You May or May Not Have Heard Before, which The Telegraph (UK) called \u201ca stunningly good record\u201d, Shindell revisited some of his earlier material, giving fresh interpretations to old favourites.\n\nIn 2015 he joined forces again with Lucy Kaplansky to record another collection of covers, Tomorrow You\u2019re Going (Signature Sounds), also produced by Larry Campbell. Consisting mostly of love songs, or love lost songs, it provided Shindell and Kaplansky an occasion to revel in their distinctive, two-part harmony with the backing of a top-notch band (Byron Isaacs, Dennis McDermott, Bill Payne, and Campbell) - all thanks to the participation of a committed community of fans who financed the project via the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.

My anxiety was so bad in college that I had seizures and panic attacks. My brain would just shut down. When I would finally recover, I\u2019d feel the emptiness depression brought shortly after.\u201d\n\nDuring this time, Spencer had begun to write songs with his best friend Zach Lovett and started to understand it\u2019s more than a creative outlet. \u201cThe lowly moments turned into opportunities to write songs.\u201d As their college band dissolved, the two went onto form Young Valley along with Zach\u2019s twin brother Dylan Lovett.\n\n\u201cZach taught me so much about writing songs, and I absorbed everything I could. He had been doing it for much longer and knew what made a song work. He helped me find my voice.\u201d The songwriting team found endless opportunity and took Young Valley on the road.\n\nSpencer dropped out of school, moved back to Jackson, and toured with Young Valley heavily for the next five years playing the drums and singing. \u201cI\u2019d get the Don Henley or the Levon Helm comment all the time. It was hard as hell to learn to play drums and sing at the same time, but I managed. I always wanted to play in a real band.\u201d\n\nAll the while, Thomas had written a few songs in his own time that didn\u2019t fit the mold Young Valley had created. \u201cWe tried some more personal tunes of mine that didn\u2019t come across like it was in my head, so I put them in my back pocket.\u201d As Thomas\u2019s influences matured, he realized the kind of songwriter he wanted to be. \u201cI love guys like Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, and Bruce Springsteen. They took so many risks as songwriters with their sounds changing from record to record. Their creative freedom was astounding.\u201d\n\nAfter Petty\u2019s death late 2017, Spencer decided to book studio dates for the songs he saved up on the side. \u201cWe\u2019re only on this earth for so long. Tom Petty left behind a legacy and songs over a 40 year career and I said \u2018I want to do that.\u2019\u201d Young Valley had just finished the final touches on their self-titled record in Water Valley, Mississippi with Matt Patton (Drive-By Truckers) and Bronson Tew (Fat Possum, Dial Back Sound) who welcomed Thomas in to bring his record to life.\n\nTeaming up with Tew as his producer/engineer/bass player and Young Valley band mates Ethan Frink and Kell Kellum as the rest of the backing band, Hangin\u2019 Tough was tracked in February 2018. \u201cI found my musical identity in this album. It touches on all my influences and my mental struggles. I quote a friend of mine I sent the album to early on. He said \u2018You wrote an album about depression\u2014and it\u2019s beautiful.\u2019\u201d", "otherInfo": "Justin Peter Kinkel-Schuster\nSpencer Thomas"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "DJ Douggpound", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "COMEDY NIGHT - PARTIALLY SEATED"}, {"Address": "201 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "San Francisco Symphony", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9514701.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419994, 37.777441], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Classical, Other, Instrumental", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Davies Symphony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The orchestra may be the San Francisco Symphony, but the music and the mood will be decidedly Russian for this concert featuring masterworks by Prokofiev and Shostakovich.

Heavy metal has endured for more than four decades because its spirit is eternal, and few bands embody the intensity, integrity and lofty artistic ambitions of the genre with more dazzling aplomb than Arch Enemy. Formed in Sweden in the mid-90s by former Carcass/Carnage guitarist Michael Amott, this most explosive and proficient of modern metal bands have spent the last 20 years propagating an unerring creed of technical excellence, songwriting genius and thunderous, irresistible live performance, accruing a huge global fan base along the way. And now, in 2017, Arch Enemy are ready to rise again and climb ever further up the ladder toward pure metal supremacy.\n\n\u201cThe band's core musical philosophy hasn't changed much since I started the band,\u201d says Amott. \u201cIt's still about creating intense heavy metal with extreme vocals and a lot of melody in the guitars. We've always loved writing and meticulously crafting the best songs possible, that's the main motivation for us.\u201d When Arch Enemy released their debut album Black Earth in 1996, death metal was stagnating and in desperate need of a kick up the ass. Amott\u2019s blueprint for the purest of metal strains proved an instant underground hit, both in Europe and Japan, and almost single-handedly resurrected death metal as a viable art form with mainstream potential. Signed to Century Media Records for 1998\u2019s sophomore effort Stigmata, Arch Enemy marched purposefully towards a new millennium with a rapidly growing reputation. 1999\u2019s Burning Bridges added to the band\u2019s momentum, their razor-sharp blend of brutality and epic melody becoming more refined with each creative step.\n\nBut it was in 2001, when original vocalist Johan Liiva stood aside and mercurial frontwoman Angela Gossow stepped in, that Arch Enemy truly took off. Released in 2001 in Japan and nearly a year later in Europe, Wages Of Sin showcased a revitalised line-up and newfound gift for immortal anthems, Gossow\u2019s feral roar adding many layers of charisma and power to Arch Enemy\u2019s already monstrous sound. Swiftly dedicating themselves to a relentless touring schedule, the band\u2019s upward trajectory continued throughout the first decade of the 21st century, with each successive album enhancing the band\u2019s reputation and bringing legions of new fans to this resolute heavy metal campaign. Albums like 2003\u2019s vicious Anthems Of Rebellion and 2011\u2019s pitch-black and savage Khaos Legions ensured that Amott and his loyal henchmen \u2013 Gossow, drummer Daniel Erlandsson, bassist Sharlee D\u2019Angelo and Michael\u2019s guitarist sibling Christopher - remained firmly at the top of the extreme metal tree: respected veterans at the height of their powers. \u201cSurviving and thriving in the metal scene is not always easy,\u201d Amott admits. \u201c\n\nContrary to what I've seen a lot of people say, I feel the scene is actually quite trend driven and it's impossible to be at the peak of your popularity all the time. In the past two decades we've seen a lot of trends and bands come and go. What I've always believed to be important is to stay true to yourself and the reasons why you started. Why you love music must always be at the forefront. I'm pretty good at keeping the 15-year-old Michael Amott alive in my heart!\u201d Always focused but impervious to other\u2019s rules and expectations, Arch Enemy evolved once more in 2015 following the departure of Angela Gossow (now the band\u2019s manager).\n\nReplacing one of the most iconic vocalists of the modern age was never going to be easy, but in the shape of former The Agonist frontwoman Alissa White-Gluz, Arch Enemy found the perfect candidate. Unveiled on the ferocious, anthem-laden triumph of 2014\u2019s War Eternal, Alissa\u2019s powerful identity and extraordinary vocal talents proved a natural and instantly welcomed fit. Further extensive touring cemented the new line-up\u2019s thrilling efficacy, before one final line-up change \u2013 the arrival of legendary guitarist Jeff Loomis, formerly of Nevermore \u2013 completed the musical puzzle that Amott had been tinkering with for the best part of 20 years. \u201cSwitching singers in 2014 was a big change of course,\u201d Amott agrees. \u201cAlissa brings a lot the band as a singer and a very visually strong performer but also she writes great lyrics and vocal patterns that are very different to mine, which makes for more variation in the Arch Enemy sound. The twin-guitar attack has always been a big part of our sound and now we have Jeff Loomis who's played some face-melting leads on the new album!\u201d Recorded in 2017, the tenth Arch Enemy album will be unleashed later in 2017 and promises to be the ultimate statement of heavy metal supremacy from a band that are still growing in stature as the years fall away. Will To Power will be the first album the band have recorded with their current line-up and as Michael Amott explains, diehard fans will be both thrilled to hear their favourite band on top form and somewhat surprised by their latest creative explorations.\n\n\u201cThe goal is always to raise the bar yet again and create an epic masterpiece!\u201d he laughs. \u201cI think the album has a great balance between traditional Arch Enemy and some new influences that come through here and there. The most surprising thing on this album is that we've written our first ever ballad. It's still a very metal song, but there's no way around the fact that it is a ballad and that might be quite controversial for a band like us, I guess. I'm excited to hear what our fans will think of that one, but I do feel that we can afford to spread our wings a bit on our tenth studio album!\u201d\n\nOnce Will To Power hits the streets, Arch Enemy will do what they do best, hitting the road and taking their latest batch of heroic metal anthems to the people. Achieving longevity is the toughest challenge that faces any band, but Arch Enemy have long since established themselves as a permanent fixture on the global metal scene and as standard bearers for upholding and celebrating of the heavy metal code. Right now, in 2017, no other band embodies the spirit of the genre with such flair and euphoric zeal. Long may their steel spirit prevail.\n\u201cIt's always been about creating the best songs we can make and whatever success we've had is the direct result of the music speaking to people and our relentless worldwide touring,\u201d Michael grins. \u201cWe are happy with the fact that the band has had growth spurt these last couple of years and it's exciting to put on a bigger and more complete live show for our fans. We obviously hope our fans will enjoy Will To Power and we're looking forward to getting back out there and performing live again, with a whole bunch of killer new tunes up our sleeve!\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "155 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Gaucho", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7519822.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.405592, 37.796778], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Acoustic, Swing", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Comstock Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "Gaucho is a masterful Bay Area band that combines the influence of gypsy jazz of 1930\u2019s Europe with the rhythmic drive and collective improvisation of New Orleans swing music, gutbucket blues and elements of ragtime.

Not necessarily his memories, though they creep in often, too. Rather, he mulls over the idea of memory itself: its resilience, its haziness, how it slips away as we try to hang on, the way it resurfaces despite our best efforts to forget.\n\nMemory is the common thread running throughout the Columbus folk-punk band's fourth album, Pillar of Na, arriving in August 31st via ANTI- Records. Following 2015's critically lauded Such Things, the new album's name is rooted in remembrance, referencing the Genesis story of Lot's wife who looks back at a burning Sodom after God instructs her not to. She looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. \"Na,\" meanwhile, is the chemical symbol for sodium. \"Nah\" is a passive refusal and the universal song word. It means nothing and stands for nothing. It is \"as it is.\"\n\nLike Lot's wife, Little cannot help but revisit where-and how-he grew up. Raised in church in southeastern Appalachian Ohio, he took up preaching when he was still a teenager, sometimes in small country settings and other times to congregations of thousands. But these days he's more interested in listening. And questioning.\n\nMusically, Pillar of Na is Saintseneca's most ambitious album to date, with Little aiming to incorporate genre elements he'd rarely heard in folk. \"I wanted to use the idiom of folk-rock, or whatever you want to call it, and to try to do something that had never been done before,\" Little explains. \"To reach way back, echoing ancient folk melodies, tie that into punk rock, and then push it into the future. I told Mike Mogis I wanted Violent Femmes meets the new Blade Runner soundtrack.

Now a quarter-century into that career, Snider has done it again. After making rock records of one kind or another for seven years, both as a solo artist and with his band, Hard Working Americans, Snider has made another left turn and returned to his folk roots with the release in March 2019 of his thirteenth studio album as a solo artist, Cash Cabin Sessions, Vol. 3. As the title suggests, the album was recorded at the studio formerly owned by Johnny Cash and now owned by his son, John Carter Cash. Snider played all the instruments on the record, mostly guitar and harmonica, but he also played banjo on one song and overdubbed mandolin and percussion on some others. The only other people on the album are Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, who contributed backing vocals to several songs. Among the highlights of the record are a trio of talking blues numbers, which reinforce the fact Snider has come full circle with the album because it was the song \u201cTalking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues\u201d from his 1994 debut, Songs For The Daily Planet, that first launched the native of Portland, Oregon, into the national consciousness. Now twenty-twenty-five years later, he has released another folk record, and as Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and others did before him, reminded the world of the enormous power that can come from one man, his guitar, and the truth.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Scott Law", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9483377.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: AMERICANA-BLUEGRASS-ROCK N ROLL", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "SCOTT LAW\nwww.scottlawmusic.com\nScott Law may have been born in Southern California but his music pulls together traditions from every corner of the country.\n\nMultifaceted artist Scott Law is an accomplished guitar master, singer-songwriter and recording artist operating at the very highest level of his craft.

Very soon Moit (guitar) completed the lineup and Oranssi Pazuzu, The Demon of the Wind with the Colour of Cosmic Energy, was born. During it\u2019s initial months the band wrote songs collectively, fusing together various influences from space rock to black metal, to capture different states of mental cosmos. These early songs were recorded by Sami Jormanainen in Korjak\u2019s family cabin in the late summer of 2008 and released as the group\u2019s debut album Muukalainen puhuu by Violent Journey Records in April 2009. In 2009-2010 Oranssi Pazuzu played shows around Finland and continued to write music that twisted towards more metallic and aggressive moods. In September 2010 they played first concerts outside Finland in Germany and the Netherlands. In November a split album with friend\u2019s band Candy Cane was released as a co-operation of two labels Firebox and Verdura Records. Kosmonument, their second full length album, was recorded in the old cold Karhu Manor in March 2011. Candy Cane\u2019s Marko Neuman acted as an artistic advisor, while Sami Jormanainen returned to the engineering and mixing duties. A concept album about a drifter lost in the void, Kosmonument was released in October 2011 as a cd by Spinefarm Records and as a double vinyl album by Blackspin Music. Also a vinyl version of the debut Muukalainen puhuu was released in May 2011 by Svart Records. After the release of Kosmonument, Oranssi Pazuzu played various European festivals in 2012, including Roadburn and Hellfest. They returned home satisfied, having also met Nikos Giagoudakis, who kindly decided to start as the band\u2019s manager. Being dropped from Spinefarm label, the band decided that it was time to move forward, and returned to writing new material with a newfound enthusiasm and freedom. Agreeing to work with Jaime Gomez Arellano, a London-based producer and engineer, Oranssi Pazuzu travelled to his Orgone Studios to record their third album in February 2013. After a succesful session with Gomez, the band finalized a new record deal with their old vinyl label Svart Records and with 20 Buck Spin for the album\u2019s North American release. Oranssi Pazuzu\u2019s third album is called Valonielu, and it will be released on in October 2013. Produced, recorded and mixed by Jaime Gomez Arellano, it includes six songs that rank among the band\u2019s most ambitious yet, from the album opener Vino verso\u2019s trance metal to the epic finale of Ympyr\u00e4 on viiva tomussa. An European tour is also planned to coincide with the album\u2019s release.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "456 Castro, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Throwback Thursdays", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6195517.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.435431, 37.761602], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Q Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Throwback Thursdays\" w/ DJ Jorge Terez"}, {"Address": "2369 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "ICandy", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.434352, 37.762839], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "I Candy at The Cafe: This long-running gay dance hotspot recently reopened after major renovations.

Norton and Edward A. Williams had been through a number of musical endeavours individually - including duos - and the prospect of a new project sounded intriguing. As details were hashed out, the core principles became readily evident: have fun and tour often. With a large stable of strong self and co-written songs and a prominent mission statement, Ash and Ed were ready to embark on a new journey. All that was needed was a name.\n\nAgain, a question: \u201cHow about \u2018whitherward\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe name took quickly, gaining a life of its own; within days, a website was created, local shows were booked, recordings were done, and a small tour was constructed. It was exciting and validating; a musical project where the sky was the limit, and no challenge seemed insurmountable.\n\nThen, after surveying the current outlook of their career, a new question arose: \u201cWhat if we toured full-time?\u201d\n\nIt would mean a lot of sacrifice - regular work schedules would be scuttled, permanent housing foregone, and material possessions reduced to a minimum. The performance requirements of sustaining a full-time tour would be grueling, and the workload more than doubles when considering the financial commitment required of being on the road indefinitely.\n\nBut amongst all the new responsibilities and stresses, there\u2019s an inherent mystery about the open road - from a typical human vantage, it\u2019s impossible to see what is around the next bend, over the next hill. In an ironic twist, this provides a startling clarity about life and how it can be lived - as so many people profess - day by day. When you can only see as far as the next hill, it somehow manages to decrease the amount of worry about what\u2019s on the other side. Rather, it helps to build a sense of wonder for what\u2019s over there, and you want to keep pushing to see it for yourself.\n\nThe duo now has four self-produced, self-published EPs full of intricate, thoughtful music, putting the emotions of life on the road and outside of the box on display. A full length album is in the works. New collaborations with bassist Patrick Hershey and violinist Stephanie Groot on both the 4th EP and the upcoming full-length album expand the sonic landscape of the duo\u2019s efforts. In addition to playing over 200 shows a year, their travels enable them to reach a number of diehard fans, new destinations, and old friends that serve to grow an ever-expanding audience.\n\nWhitherward is an Old English adverb that means \u201cin which direction\u201d. The word seems to invite an eternal question; it feels like the perfect fit for a duo that constantly seeks to reinvent itself in every aspect of its existence, always looking for the next impossible question to answer. There is forward; there is backward; and then there is Whitherward.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "119 Utah St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Eddie C", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.406803, 37.768186], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, R&b/soul, Electronic, Disco", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "The Great Northern", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Stranger Things Go Bump In The Night: Halloween w/ AMTRAC // Eddie C In The Loft"}, {"Address": "29 Broadway, Fairfax, CA 94930", "Artist": "Junk Parlor", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8142032.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.588573, 37.986854], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Junk, Rock", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Peri's Silver Dollar Bar", "moreBioInfo": "JUNK PARLOR Biography A galvanizing force on the Bay Area indie rock scene since launching serendipitously in 2013, Junk Parlor is that crazy-rare band whose vibe is so driven by joyful schizophrenia that it transcends easy genre trappings. Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "101 6th st, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Rob G", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8135001.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "MOSAIC | Chuck Love, Mario Dubbz, Rob G, Brent Northey, Erik Love, DJ Seven"}, {"Address": "119 Utah St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Dj M3 aka Makes Me Move", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.406803, 37.768186], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "The Great Northern", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Stranger Things Go Bump In The Night: Halloween w/ AMTRAC // Eddie C In The Loft"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "PALMISTRY", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Future|Perfect presents\nPalmistry\n> soundcloud.com/palmistry\n+ TBA\nPalmistry\n> Palmistry is the project of London-based musician Benjy Keating.

For over 3 decades he has elevated and shaped an entire genre and remains one of the leading forces in the global music scene today.\n\nHis most recent works have taken him from the DJ booth of the worlds hottest nightspots and festivals to the studio producing soundtracks for Hollywood blockbuster movies. His diversity in artistry and ability has earned him accolades from critics and fans alike. Garnering him not 1 but 2 Grammy Nominations for his works.\n\nBut lets take a step back. The son of a musician, Paul came up as a young DJ in the late '70s spinning Funk in Covent Garden. Not what some might have expected from one of Trances preeminent masters. But he knew then music would be his life. In the '80s 2 life-changing trips took place. The first in 1984 where he spent several months living in New York City working as A&R man for the famed Champion Records signing DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, as well as Salt-n-Pepa. He also became promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C.\n\nThe second trip and more contemporary influence was in 1987 which brought Paul to the White Isle of Ibiza. Here he discovered the Balearic sound that flowed through the Ibiza air at clubs such as Amnesia. Inspired, he took the music and experiences back to the UK and became its ambassador. Paul returned often holding residencies at Amnesia and Pacha in Ibiza. Around the same time Ministry Of Sound in London was opening and tauted Paul as their first resident. However it was his famed residency at UK super-club Cream in Liverpool that brought Paul global respect as a master of his art. It was some say the catalyst to what has made him a touring legend.\n\nThis residency was celebrated through the Grammy nominated 2004 compilation \u2018Creamfields\u2019 (Paul went on to receive a second Grammy nomination in 2007 with his artist album, \u201cA Lively Mind\u201d and then again in 2009 for his production work with Madonna).\n\nOakenfold\u2019s stature as a DJ and entertainer has taken him beyond the normal club and festival circuit, playing landmark gigs that have changed the face of electronic music. Highlights include three worldwide tours warming up for Madonna and U2 (with both artists insisting on a DJ set from Paul instead of a support band); performing physically on the Great Wall of China and two sold out dates playing to 30,000 people at the Hollywood Bowl in California.\n\nA year after that first visit to Ibiza, Perfecto was born. Founded in 1988, Oakenfold\u2019s groundbreaking Perfecto record label played an integral role in the birth of trance music, with Paul at the helm producing massive international hits such as \u201cNot Over Yet\u201d, \u201cBullet In The Gun\u201d and \u201cSouthern Sun\u201d. With countless high profile releases and remixes in its path, Perfecto Records is still the benchmark to which so many labels measure themselves. 20+ years later, Perfecto remains as cutting edge and popular as ever, even resurrecting its Perfecto Fluoro sublabel in 2011. Probably Perfecto\u2019s most notable release was the recent double album \u201cPerfecto Las Vegas\u201d which held the #1 spot on the US iTunes dance chart for several weeks. This release solidified Paul\u2019s stronghold as an International DJ power player achieving the highest selling DJ compilation ever released in US history \u2013 with over half a million sales.\n\nPaul has produced for megastars such as U2, Madonna (including her latest release \u201cCelebration\u201d) and The Happy Mondays. As well as three acclaimed artist albums under his own name. He has remixed Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones and Justin Timberlake and released over 20 DJ mix compilations. In recent years Paul has also been responsible for creating some of the most breathtaking film scores and cues for a long list of Hollywood blockbusters \u2013 including The Bourne Identity, Matrix Reloaded, Shrek 2, Swordfish and Collateral. But his most anticipated release is yet to come. Paul Oakenfold\u2019s newest artist album \u2018Pop Killer\u2019 is scheduled for imminent release featuring The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Gnarls Barkley, OneRepublic and B.O.B.\n\nAstonishingly, despite all his success in the worlds of chart music and film, Oakenfold has found time to keep in touch with his roots as a club DJ. Over the past 3 years he has held a weekly residency at the legendary Rain nightclub in The Palms, Las Vegas. Planet Perfecto is a fully produced show with 75 circus performers, cutting edge visuals and special effects - giving the 3,000-strong crowd a truly unique experience.\n\nWhether you are listening to a CD, watching a commercial, going to a club or playing a video game; Paul\u2019s omnimedia presence is felt everywhere.

The multi-talented artist can electrify an audience, be it with a moving live music performance or by working dancefloors up to a sweat with his driving yet funk-filled DJ sets \u2013 it\u2019s his mantra to be as diverse a DJ as possible, to connect with the crowd and to keep them moving at all costs.\n\nRaised in Morehead, Kentucky on a diet of deep cuts by Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, Caleb was lured to the dance realm by crossover acts such as The Prodigy and Chemical Brothers. Both sets of influences show on his debut LP, Came Along (2010), a 13-track adventure awash in post-punk influences and indie dance charm. From there, he branched out even further with Hey There Kiddo (2012), an all-sample opus with deep disco roots inspired by one of his favorite albums of all time, Since I Met You by The Avalanches; and The Scheme EP (2012) explores underground deep house vibes with dark, funky rhythms. Most recently he released his single \u201cThose Days\u201d featuring a Stevie Wonder vocal on legendary UK dance label Toolroom Records.\n\nBut as impressive as his original works may be, one can\u2019t discuss Cornett\u2019s body of work without mentioning what may well be the calling card of his career: the remix. An Amtrac remix has become a coveted commodity in today\u2019s music business \u2013 from Majors like Interscope, Warner Bros, Def Jam & Sony to tastemaker labels like Fools Gold, Kitsune, Defected, and Ministry of Sound, as well as a host of popular artists including Ellie Goulding, Fred Falke, Elliphant, Two Door Cinema Club, and Kaskade have all requested the Amtrac treatment, and each time he\u2019s delivered (and then some).\n\n\nNever content to settle, Amtrac\u2019s musical mood and influences change with each passing season. His ambition and curiosity keep him locked on the edge, always happy to experiment with new techniques and sounds. His music is what he feels in the moment. Simply put, his constant evolution comes from a hatred of boredom and a love for his labor. It\u2019s just not in his nature to stagnate.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1524 Civic Dr, Walnut Creek, CA 94596", "Artist": "Brodie Stewart Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9052550.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.062471, 37.901758], "Date": "Fri Oct 25 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-25", "Genre": "Genres: Modern Country", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Dan\u2019s Irish Sports Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Brodie Stewart grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento and spent his summers in Red Bluff California. At a young age his favorite things to do were going to the Rodeo, listening to country music, singing and playing guitar. Soon enough, Brodie formed and fronted a southern rock band and had the good fortune of touring the country opening up for big artists in front of sold out arenas. His band even charted on Billboard. With his southern rock roots, Brodie returned to what he loved the most, \"country music\". While working on tracks for his own band Brodie also wrote and produced songs for various other artists such as \u201cSweet Isabel\u201d recorded by Enrique Iglesias for his (Interscope Records) Release entitled \u201cInsomniac\u201d. Shortly after placing Sweet Isabel with Enrique, Martin Kierszenbaum (President of Cherrytree/Interscope Records) signed Brodie to a song/production deal to the label. Quickly following, Brodie signed a publishing deal with (Warner Chappell Music Publishing). Since that time Brodie has written and produced several tracks for various artists. Currently 100% of Brodie's attention is on The Brodie Stewart Band's country music endeavor. On his debut album \"Born American\", Brodie teamed up with guitarist/ producer/ songwriter \"Adam Shoenfeld\" (Jason Aldean, Tim Mcgraw, Luke Bryan, Keith Urban, Jake Owen, Big and Rich,Florida Georgia Line and many more..) to co-produce and play on the album along with several top players, including working with one great engineer \"Aaron Chmielewski\" in Nashville. In addition to gearing up promotion for the new album, The Brodie Stewart Band's \"high octane show\" has been touring the west coast opening up for top recording artists such as... \"Lee Brice, Thompson Square, Easton Corbin, Joe Nichols, Blues Traveler, Lonestar, Chris Cagle, Jason Michael Carroll, Terri Clark, Josh Gracin, Casey James, The Farm, Moonshine Bandits, Greg Bates, Christian Kane, Chuck Wicks and more...\"\n\nWhen asked about his current album Brodie states: \"I've found my place in Country Music where my heart has always been.

That\u2019s why, at the age of six, he would have sold his mother to see Michael Jackson moonbreaking live. No, wait, I think that\u2019s what he did, actually. Soon after that, at junior high, with only one kidney left, he got interested in hip-hop, around the age of ten. And at this point you\u2019re asking yourself : \u201cOkay, but, why he didn\u2019t get interested in some japanese headfucking animation like every kids at that time ?\u201d. And this is a good question. Well, I don\u2019t realy know the answer, but I can figure this can be the reason why he is now a good DJ. I mean, do you think that Goldorack-headfucked kids can get as good at DJing as hip-hop early interested kids ? I don\u2019t think so. Anyway ! 1990 : The hardcore french rappers from NTM (Nique Ta M\u00e8re, It means \u201cGo fuck your mom\u201d in french) weren\u2019t hudge yet, but Akira was already listening to some cranky hip hop bands from the east coast, like the Beastie Boys (the reason for him to sell his father.) Finally he got two decks at seventeen and kept his parents, hurray. Style: Akira started his beatmatching work with some old club house records. Then he got hardcore and did drugs (I mean crack) and things got complicated and \u2026 JUST KIDDING !!! Actually, after house, he got techno, like Detroit techno. Thanks to Jeff Mills, Akira was saved from the housy stuffs for ever ! After that, he did a lot of drum\u2019n\u2019bass (for a fucked up place), then breakbeat, and finally, in the stride of break, he got hip-hop (again, in the end !) All the styles he added to his selection through the years allow him having this assumed and claimed Eclectism on stage, and yes, it\u2019s a capital E. As his friend Garfld, Akira is able to play some fat acid break track from the u.k. then pursue with a RATM metal anthem. Call this a dangerous drive if you want, but it does really work on the dancefloor (ask you mum.) Philosophy: Akira\u2019s big admiration for genius turntablists like Craze, Netik or Kentaro pushes him to work out everyday (well, each non hangover day, actually) his technical scratching skills and vynil touch. Isn\u2019t it a awesum thing in a world more and more made of digital deejaying ? What you can be sure you\u2019ll never get with Akira is the laptop point and click stuff. Only black, glossy, loud, and heavy records. For ever and ever ! Above pure djing, Akira is also the founder and president of Electrons Libres crew, and he is producer.

The title is not arbitrarily applied. His first major musical success was in 2012 with a trapped-out remix of Hardstyle superstar Showtek\u2019s \u201cF.T.S.\u201d This tune, which Saymyname credits as the impetus for the Hardtrap genre, was banged out ad infinitum on every major festival stage in the world multiple times over. LA Weekly has also acknowledged this title. By fusing Hardstyle with Trap, \u201cthe dance music world has been better for it ever since\u201d. But this Humboldt, California native had modest beginnings. Saymyname was raised in a musical family. By the age of 5, his father, a DJ himself, cultivated in Dayve a passion for music. At 12, he picked up DJing as a hobby. His high school years were punctuated by his interest in music, sports, and the arts (Dayvid is an accomplished Graffiti and street artist). He took two years of advanced music theory courses, which set him on the path to professional music production. He first experimented with Apple\u2019s Garage Band but soon graduated to more advanced production tools like Acid, Reason, Sylenth and Abelton. He was accepted to Chapman University in Orange County, California, the prestigious IVY league of the West Coast. While there he kept himself as focused on music as he did on his academics and, in 2013, his diligent work ethic and production prowess combined to win him the coveted Insomniac Discovery Project contest. This win landed him squarely in front of thousands of fans at EDC Las Vegas, and his performance was touted as one of the best of the festival. His future in dance music was becoming a reality, but this dream had yet to pay the bills. After college, Dayve continued to work 35-40 hours a week at Guitar Center, then rushed home to produce in his bedroom at night. It was this job at Guitar Center that got him through those tough early days, and two days before his first Australia tour, he handed in his two weeks. Now, years later, with top headline and mainstage billings across the globe and mega hits like his collaboration with Mercer, \u201cWanted\u201d, and his remixes of Dj Snake\u2019s \u201cPropoganda\u201d and Mercer\u2019s \u201cEncore\u201d, Saymyname finds himself at the center of setlists by Dance music\u2019s elite including Tiesto, Afrojack, David Guetta, Dillon Francis, Madeon, Dimitri Vegas Like Mike, Jauz, W&W, DYRO, Borgeous, Showtek, NGHTMRE, and Diplo. Towering above the decks at 6\u20195, Saymyname is the undisputed champion and originator of Hardtrap.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Boo! became not only one of South Africa's favorite bands of all time, but also one of the country's proudest musical exports to both Europe and North America.\n\nIn 7 years Boo! acquired an enormous cult following worldwide by performing 800 gigs in 17 countries, including 14 states in the USA as well as countries such as Hungary and Croatia. Bradishing their self-styled genre of \"monkipunk\", Boo! performed at various European and American festivals with the likes of the White Stripes, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Franz Ferdinand, Smashing Pumpkins, and Coldplay amongst others. The band also received a South African Music Award (SAMA) in 2002 for 'Best Pop Album'.\n\nThe band's sound consisted of bass, drums, brass, keyboards and percussion; notably lacking guitar. In spite of this unusual orchestration, Boo! hit the number one position on the 5FM top 40 with \"Stagefright\" and a number two position with \"OOAA\" - testimony to frontman, bassist and occasional drag queen, Chris Chameleon's exceptional songwriting abilities.\n\nIn September 2004, Ampie Omo and Leon Retief announced their resignation from Boo! and performed their final show with the band on 14 September 2004. Leon Retief continued his career behind the scenes in the South African Music Industry while Ampie Omo continued his career as a member of ska-outfit Fuzigish and was the invited guest trombonist of the Violent Femmes when they played in South Africa in 2005 and 2007. Chris Chameleon surprised his punk pundits and cohorts by becoming one of the best-selling and critically acclaimed artists in the Afrikaans music landscape, notching up at total of 20 national awards in 5 years including two South African Music Awards (SAMA) and a Medal of Honor from the South African Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\n2010 saw Boo! emerge again with a change in wardrobe and drummers with Riaan van Rensburg picking up the sticks on drums. The band set up camp in Amsterdam, The Netherlands early in the year to record the new album \"THE THREE OF US\". On their return, a limited edition run of albums was released for sale at gigs only. The album has since been completely remixed by Neal Snyman with audio approval of award-winning producer Theo Crous (Parlotones, Prime Circle, etc) and remastered by Jonathan Crossley.\n\nBoo! won Suckfree Radio's \"Greatest Unsigned Band in the World\" competition in September 2010 just before signing to Seed, a division of Sheer Sound. The remixed and remastered \"THE THREE OF US\" album was released by Seed in South Africa in early October 2010 followed by a spectacular launch at Montecasino on October 15 2010. The album has already spawned a hit single \"The Three of Us\", which climbed the charts across South African radio and the current single \"To Do Today\" is doing the same.\n\n2011 is set to be the Year of the Boo!", "otherInfo": "18 AND OVER ONLY"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Kuromi", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "*SWMRS presents: UNCOOL FEST 5"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Ultra Q", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9248857.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Alt-Rock, Rock, Guitar Music, Pop", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Ultra Q is an American rock band formed in Oakland, California in 2019.

The Los Angeles-based trio made their bones as purveyors of post-millennial punk, but with their third full-length release \u2013 and Harvest Records debut \u2013 BADILLAC, they pay their debt to the supersonic 90s rock that first inspired them. The band has not sacrificed a spurt of precious energy, instead integrating nuance and dynamic momentum to songs like \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and the undeniably badass title track. The volcanic riffs and massive melodies are matched by an equally provocative lyrical stance, with songs like \u201cSick Shit\u201d and the album-closing \u201cWhere The Night Ends\u201d casting an acerbic eye over the wreckage of the party they helped start \u2013 it\u2019s 3am and the drunken fun has given way to sexual panic, anxiety and self-doubt. Slightly stoned but by no means slack, BADILLAC reveals together PANGEA to be both confident and surprisingly committed, their audacious ambition already impossible to contain.\n\n\u201cIt might be confusing for people, assuming we\u2019re like this garage punk band and then hearing this record,\u201d says singer/songwriter/guitarist William Keegan. \u201cBut we really don\u2019t want to get trapped at all.\u201d\n\nKeegan first started writing and recording in his Santa Clarita bedroom, his teenage tapes eventually coming to full flower with the aid of bassist Danny Bengston and drummer Erik Jimenez. Known then simply as Pangea, the band played countless beer blasts in and around CalArts, their boozy mayhem and breakneck pop hooks quickly earning them frenzied crowds throughout the Southern California DIY scene and beyond. A string of seven-inches, cassettes, and LPs \u2013 including 2011\u2019s ace second album, LIVING DUMMY, released by Burger Records and The Smell\u2019s Olfactory label \u2013 followed, as did gigs alongside a veritable who\u2019s-who of like-minded rockers, including Ty Segall, Mikal Cronin, Wavves, and The Black Lips (not to mention 2013\u2019s epic \u201cBurgerama Caravan of Stars\u201d US tour).\n\nBADILLAC was recorded with their longtime producer/engineer Andrew Schubert over three intensive sessions at his Tarzana studio, their roster augmented by second guitarist Cory Hanson (of the electronic pop outfit, W-H-I-T-E). While many bands in their position would have simply continued banging out the party punk, together PANGEA decided to throw a curveball at themselves and their fervent fanbase.\n\n\u201cWe wrote like 30 plus songs for this record,\u201d Bengston says, \u201chalf of which have the same punky bubblegum vibe of our last record. Then we had this other batch of songs, a little more melancholy, a little heavier, a little darker. I think in the end we just decided to try to not make the same record twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I write, there are certain songs that I feel fit the band,\u201d Keegan says, \u201cand then there are songs where it doesn\u2019t feel like they fit. At some point, I was like, maybe we should try some of the songs that don\u2019t necessarily fit. Because I realized that they do fit \u2013 they\u2019re just different.\u201d\n\nThough Keegan cites such unexpected heroes as Pete Seeger and 21st Century K Records artists like Little Wings and the Microphones, he fully fesses up to BADILLAC\u2019s most primal inspirations. Indeed, songs like \u201cWhy\u201d and the cello-laced \u201cNo Way Out\u201d fuse classic post punk ambivalence with fist-pumping stadium rock, their neurotic hooks, throat-rending vocals, and fat, distorted riffs hearkening back to the glory days of the alternative nation.\n\n\u201cTo me, the album is so obviously influenced by the shit that I was listening to when I was 16,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cGrowing up in the 90s, all that stuff \u2013 Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Weezer. It wasn\u2019t conscious, the album just sounds like that. It feels like that music is etched in deeper that music I\u2019ve listened to as an adult. For whatever reason, the music you listened to when you\u2019re confused and young gets in deeper than anything you might listen to later.\u201d\n\nBADILLAC also sees together PANGEA stepping away from their association with a much-hyped scene they believe too often revels in its own idiocy, Keegan\u2019s wry lyrics pushing both their music and subject matter towards unsettling themes of impotence, fear, ennui, and detachment.\n\n\u201cWe think less and less about how we fit into this garage punk scene that we never even technically felt a part of,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cWe just kinda get lumped into that. I\u2019m not really stoked on what a lot of those bands are saying, there\u2019s a lot of misogyny and stuff I\u2019m not into.\u201d\n\nLike any angst-ridden tunesmith worth his salt, Keegan also directs his gaze inwards, coming to turns with his own cynical view of relationships on songs like the mordant \u201cOffer,\u201d their cracked melodies and jaundiced skepticism fueled by his recent romantic struggles.\n\n\u201cI went through a really difficult relationship where we were breaking up every three months for four years,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of it, I was just like, \u201cThis is never gonna work.\u2019 It was pretty intense and I think that informs a lot of the songs on the album.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kinda funny,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs soon as we finished this record, we broke up for good.\u201d\n\nBADILLAC will drive together PANGEA through 2014, their imminent plans essentially consisting of touring until they drop. Nevertheless, the band finds themselves in the unprecedented position of having to ponder the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing where the next record is gonna go,\u201d Bengston says, \u201cwe still haven\u2019t put our finger on it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Keegan says, \u201cbecause we never had to have those formal discussions, like, \u2018What should the next record sound like?\u2019 It\u2019s always been pretty natural. Hopefully that\u2019s what\u2019ll end up happening again.\u201d\nNovember 2013", "otherInfo": "*SWMRS presents: UNCOOL FEST 5"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "DYGL", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "SWMRS presents: UNCOOL FEST 5 - The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall - Berkeley, CA"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Flagship Romance", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9138376.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Harmonic Alternative Folk, Alternative Folk, Folk, Singer, Songwriter, Acoustic Alternative Folk, Acoustic, Harmonies, Contemporary Folk, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Foghouse Concerts", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWhen love and skill work together, expect a masterpiece.\u201d\u2013 John Ruskin (1819-1900)\n\nIt may be that the famous English art critic Ruskin uttered these words well over a century ago, but they remain relevant today, perfectly describing the life of married couple Shawn Fisher and Jordyn Jackson. As the Truth or Consequences, NM-based \u2018Harmonic Alternative Folk\u2019 duo Flagship Romance they live, work, and annually travel tens of thousands of miles together, deeply in love with each other and the process of bringing their emotionally powerful music to the people. It is an inspiring union of hearts, minds and souls that entrances all who encounter them and their art.\n\n\"Their songs & vocals have a simmering intensity... I also suspect Fisher used to play in rock bands, as he tended to attack his guitar with an unbridled ferociousness.\" - Mayer Danzig // Twangville\n\nFluent, intense acoustic guitar playing; lyrics of life\u2019s peaks, troughs, mysteries and wonders; soaring, yearning vocals; tender, though oft-anthemic melodies, and harmonies one could barely separate with a single human hair: this is the Flagship Romance sound. Live, sharing a custom-built dual microphone stand, they deliver their beautiful material with passionate abandon, living each song as if it will be the last they will ever perform. Such commitment to their music and stagecraft has, in just a few short years, seen the aptly-monikered Flagship Romance become huge favourites of the North American house concert circuit. This suits them just fine, as Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s preferred performance scenario is an intimate venue where the audience is tucked up close enough to them that they can hear them breathe (and, unfailingly, gasp at Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s chemistry and dynamics). Yet they have also appeared at festivals, clubs and concert halls, sharing stages with international acts including Half Moon Run, Iris DeMent, Mason Jennings and the Goo Goo Dolls.\n\nFlagship Romance are on the road for upwards of eight months a year, and have been pretty much since the release of their 2013 debut EP, The Fudge Sessions. If ever a testament to this extraordinary work ethic were needed, it would be the reaction to the crowdfunding campaign they launched to finance their 2014 full-length debut, an ambitious and ultimately stunning CD/DVD project entitled Fee Fie Foh Fum. Recorded live off the floor \u2013 difficult to comprehend considering its quality \u2013 the album captures the bristling energy of Flagship Romance live shows, and was created with the considerable backing of the duo\u2019s rapidly burgeoning legion of fans, to the tune of over $25,000.\n\nOn the back of such a successful project, one that emphatically delivered on their promises, a sophomore full-length was hotly anticipated. Lo and behold, another overwhelmingly positive Kickstarter campaign ensured that Flagship Romance could craft 2017\u2019s Tales from the Self-Help Section exactly as they wished to, employing a subtly richer sound and new vocal approaches by Jordyn. Produced by Lucio Rubino at The Fish Tank Recordings in St. Augustine, FL, Tales from the Self-Help Section is a personal, largely self-examining and emotional 12-song opus, documenting \u201cthe little victories, failures and lessons\u201d Shawn and Jordyn have experienced during the last couple of years, \u201cmostly dealing with the battles of \u2018being present,\u2019 and living with depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nOn the evidence of their gorgeous work to date it is clear that the love and skill of which John Ruskin spoke intertwine in perfect harmony in the cases of Shawn Fisher and Jordyn Jackson, and that, indeed, little masterpieces are the results. Yes, Ruskin would have loved Flagship Romance.\n\n......\n\nFlagship Romance has aligned their musical career with the clean water cause via the organization charity: water. In August 2012, Fisher and Jackson founded and organized the Clean Water Music Fest in Florida, to raise funding and awareness for the 800 million people on this planet without access to safe, clean drinking water. Since then, they have raised over $125,000; 100% of that money is currently being used for well building and tap-stand projects in Ethiopia, Rwanda, and the Sahel region of Africa.\n\nBiography by David Morrison, Folk Radio UK", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "420 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95172", "Artist": "Kruel Summer", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9209363.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.88543, 37.32983], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Rock, Reggae-Pop, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Forager Tasting Room & Eatery", "moreBioInfo": "KRUEL SUMMER is a new project based in San Jose, CA formed by previous members of The Holdup (Clev Stiles & Kyle Christensen).

Concurrently, budding African-American rapper, Cam Young, was growing up in the Tampa area. He and his family had relocated to Florida from New Jersey when Cam was 7, and his father brought his affinity for New York hip-hop with him, exposing his son to the work of The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Jay Z and Big L. His mother, on the other hand, preferred the work of Michael Jackson and Prince \u2014 hence Cam\u2019s interest in and proficiency as a rapper and a singer.\n\nA mutual Facebook friend provided Cam with a connection to Mike, who started receiving tracks from Cam via messenger in 2012.

There are various stories about Whitey's past, he has made his living making music for well over thirty years, yet has remained relatively unknown, having only recently recorded his debut album. But one known fact is that under the psuedonym Gary Nicholson his songs have been recorded by such blues greats as BB King, Etta James, Bonnie Raitt, Keb Mo, Delbert McClinton, Gatemouth Brown, James Cotton, Junior Wells, Shemeka Copeland, John Mayall and many others. He also won a Grammy as producer of the Best Contemporary Blues Record 2001, Delbert McClinton\"s \"Nothing Personal\".\nVisit garynicholson.com for more information.\n\nWhitey describes his style as \" Feel Better Blues\" with songs such as \"Use the Blues (to make you feel better)\", \"Worry Be Gone\", \"Leap of Faith\", and \"Better off with the Blues\". He learned to play guitar watching Texas legends Freddy King, Lightnin Hopkins, Mance Lipscomb, then fell in love with Robert Johnson, Muddy and Wolf and the songs of Willie Dixon. He brings a deep respect for all his heroes to his own style. His band includes Colin Linden, Tom Hambridge, and Dave Roe who all have many credits having worked with artists such as Chuck Berry, Johnny Winter, Lynryd Skynrd, Johnnny Cash, and many others.\n\nWhy Whitey? Whitey Johnson was born when Gary Nicholson wrote a short story about an amazing guitar player he saw perform at a fair in his hometown Garland, Texas. This guitarist, who covered everyone from BB King to Jimi Hendrix, was a black albino and his family called him Whitey. At the end of the story Whitey dies when a church is burned by the Klan. Now when Nicholson performs as Whitey he invokes the spirit of the blues music he has loved all his life. With deepest respect for all the great founding fathers of the blues, and songs that reflect his own unique point of view, Whitey Johnson lives on.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "K?d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9197015.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.417316, 37.778083], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Future Bass, Future Beat, Electronic", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "ALT:VISION mgmt: whoskidmgmt@gmail.com\n\nBookings:\nmrodriguez@paradigmagency.com\ntcorbin@paradigmagency.com\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/whoskid\n\nhttps://instagram.com/whos_kid\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQL0XRu3A8D0WrlWdSdrVhw/videos", "otherInfo": "#BOOSF"}, {"Address": "2001 Gayley Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720", "Artist": "Griz", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9116503.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.25063, 37.86976], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Funk, Soul, Electronic, Dance, Party Entertainment", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Hearst Greek Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "27 years old.

It was a hard time to not be inspired. Anchored by southern storytelling and swampy,country-soul swagger,Shine On Rainy Day had become a critical and commercial hit, earning Cobb a long string of shows with artistslike Chris Stapleton and Margo Price. He embraced the road-warrior lifestyle, picking up ideas for new songs every time his band hit the highway.\n\nSomewhere between the whirl of shows, hotels, and truck stops, Providence Canyon began taking shape. During breaks in the band\u2019s schedule, Cobb would return to Nashville\u2014his hometown for a decade, ever since he left his childhood stomping grounds of rural Georgia\u2014and head over to RCA Studio A. There, in an historic studio run by his cousin, producer Dave Cobb, he brewed up a sound that nodded to his previous material while still pushing forward. The songs were faster. More upbeat. More personal, too. Together, they formed his sophomore album, 2018\u2019s Providence Canyon.\n\nNamed after a Georgian gully that Cobb often visited as a teenager, Providence Canyon is an evocative, electrified album about a life lived on the run. There are road songs, half-lit drinking tunes, tributes to friends and family, and nostalgic nods to one\u2019s younger years. There are songs about returning home and songs about getting the hell out of dodge. Gluing everything together is the unforced country croon and sharp songwriting of Brent Cobb, who credits his recent touring history for inspiring the album\u2019s quicker pace.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the funkier side of country and the funkier side of rock,\u201d he explains. \u201cThose influences have been a part of me for years, but they\u2019re really coming to the forefront now. When you\u2019re touring with Chris Stapleton, and you\u2019re performing to a crowd of 10,000 people before he hits the stage, you find yourself wanting to play something upbeat.\u201d\n\nIf Shine On Rainy Day felt like a laidback country album for front-porch picking sessions, then Providence Canyon is built for something bigger. This is music for juke joints, pool halls, and roadhouses, filled with electric guitar (performed by Cobb\u2019s touring bandmate, Mike Harris), B3 organ, percussive groove, and co-ed harmonies. And while the album\u2019s recording sessions were spread out across an entire year, each song was captured in a small number of takes, with Brent and Dave Cobb relying on instinct and spur-of-the-moment ideas. The two cousins may have grown up on opposite sides of Georgia, but they share similar backgrounds and musical instincts\u2014two qualities that lend an earthy authenticity to these 11 songs of the south.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the blood,\u201d Brent says of his connection to his cousin\u2014 who, in addition to producing Shine on Rainy Day, has also overseen award-winning records for Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, and Chris Stapleton. \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up together,but we\u2019re so similar in our approaches. It\u2019s important to me to do this with him, because these songs are about the places I\u2019m from, the places I\u2019ve visited, and the people who\u2019ve taken me there. My family is all over these songs.\u201d\n\nSongs like \u201cLoreen\u201d and \u201cCome Home Soon\u201d were partially inspired by Cobb\u2019s daughter, while \u201cKing of Alabama\u201d was written in honor of a close family friend, songwriter Wayne Mills, who passed away in 2013. \u201cI keep his chain in my pocket, his son in my prayers / Every stage I\u2019m on, I can feel him there,\u201d Cobb sings during the latter song, which pays tribute not only to Mills\u2019 life, but also to the struggle of roadbound musicians everywhere. During the final chorus, Cobb promises to honor Mills\u2019 legacy by doing the very thing Mills did best: creating real, raw music. He urges his audience to do the same. \u201cHonky-tonk\u2019s the trick,\u201d he sings. \u201cGet a guitar and grab a pick / Let the old tunes possess you, and play.\u201d\n\nOn the drawling, guitar-driven \u201cMornin\u2019s Gonna Come\u201d and \u201cSucker for a Good Time,\u201d Cobb battles against the temptations of the road, where the drinks are free and the nights are long. He doubles down on his commitment to his wife and daughter with \u201cAin\u2019t a Road Too Long,\u201d whose mix of Bible Belt boogie-woogie and Southern rock channels influences like the Band. Then, on the album\u2019s breezy title track, he casts his mind back to his teenage years, when a trip to Providence Canyon\u2014a 150-feet gorge in the sandy clay of southwest Georgia, less than an hour\u2019s drive from Cobb\u2019s hometown\u2014was enough to remind him of life\u2019s fleeting, precious nature. \u201cThe night won\u2019t last forever, after all,\u201d he sings during the song\u2019s chorus, while pedal steel and acoustic guitars chime in the background.\n\nTechnically one of the oldest songs in Brent Cobb\u2019s catalog, \u201cProvidence Canyon\u201d (like the album that borrows its name) glorifies the thrill of hitting the open road, while also pining for the comfort and safety of home. Those themes permeate the album. For Cobb\u2014a longtime touring musician who\u2019d already logged years on the road before Shine on Rainy Day\u2019s success\u2014there\u2019s never been a better time to explore the interlocking worlds of family, work, home, the highway, and wanderlust. Providence Canyon is the soundtrack to that journey.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know the definition of \u2018providence,\u2019\u201d he admits. \u201cI looked it up in my early 20s, and the definition is something like \u2018the protective power of God\u2014or nature\u2014as a spiritual power.\u2019 When I read that, it inspired the whole song. I was 23 at the time, and I missed the old days and the freedom of youth. Years later, I still try to keep my music honest and somehow sacred, which is why Providence Canyon felt like the appropriate title for this collection of songs. Maybe it\u2019s got something to do with the recurring feeling of me wanting to get home all the time, even while I\u2019m enjoying my shows more than ever. Maybe home is a providence canyon in itself.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2209 Broadway St, Redwood City, CA 94063-1641", "Artist": "The Butlers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6981859.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2293, 37.48637], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "CLUB FOX", "moreBioInfo": "Vintage '70s rock band outta SF.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1 Lawson Rd., Kensington, CA 94707", "Artist": "Kensington Symphony Orchestra", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.2828, 37.917867], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Unitarian Universalist Church of Berkeley", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1 Lawson Rd., Kensington, CA 94707", "Artist": "ESPA\u00d1A", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/247207.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2828, 37.917867], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Unitarian Universalist Church of Berkeley", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero West, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8665706.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Big Daddy Kane"}, {"Address": "707 W Hornet Ave, Alameda, CA 94501", "Artist": "JB Duff", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9214941.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.301682, 37.772658], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Jazz, Blues, Swing, Celtic, Musical Theater, Americana, Punk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "USS Hornet - Sea, Air and Space Museum", "moreBioInfo": "Drums, percussion, teaching, arranging - that's what I do!

And thirty-five years and over twenty million albums into their career, the B-52s remain the among the most beloved rock stars ever. Any mystery concerning the longevity and ongoing appeal of the B-52s is immediately solved when exposed to the B-52s unique concert experience. From the timeless gems of \"Rock Lobster,\" \"Planet Claire\" and \"Private Idaho\" to the more recent classics of \"Channel Z,\" \"Love Shack\" and \"Roam\", the B-52s unforgettable dance-rock tunes start a party every time the music begins. Formed on an October night in 1976 following drinks at an Athens, GA, Chinese restaurant, the band played their first gig at a friend's house on Valentine's Day 1977. Naming themselves after Southern slang for exaggerated 'bouffant\" hairdos, the newly-christened B-52s (Fred Schneider, Kate Pierson, Keith Strickland, Cindy Wilson and Ricky Wilson) began weekend road trips to New York City for gigs at CBGB's and a handful of other venues. Before long, their thrift store aesthetic and genre-defying songs were the talk of the post-punk underground. A record deal soon followed and their self-titled debut disc, produced by Chris Blackwell, sold more than 500,000 copies on the strength of their first singles, the garage rock party classic \"Rock Lobster,\" and \"52 Girls.\" The B-52s began to attract fans far beyond the punk clubs of the Lower East Side \u2014 galvanizing the pop world with their 'stream-of-consciousness' approach to songwriting and outrageous performance. They had clearly tapped into a growing audience for new music that was much larger than anyone could have anticipated. \"We always appealed to people outside the mainstream,\" says Kate Pierson, \"and I think more people feel they're outside the mainstream these days.\" With the release of their second studio effort, Wild Planet (1980), the B-52s and co-producer Rhett Davies proved their success was no fluke with hits with \"Private Idaho,\" \"Give Me Back My Man\" and \"Strobe Light.\" In just two albums, the B-52s created a lexicon of songs, styles, phrases and images which would set the standard for the development of the 'alternative music scene' for the next decade. The success of Mesopotamia, produced by David Byrne (1982), and Whammy! (1983) positioned the B-52s as MTV regulars as well as alternative radio staples. At the time of their greatest achievements, however, they suffered their greatest tragedy \u2014 the death of guitarist Ricky Wilson from AIDS. \"He really had a vision\u2026,\" said sister Cindy Wilson. \"He was one of the strongest elements of the B-52s from the beginning.\" Ricky Wilson's passing in 1985 came just after the sessions for Bouncing Off The Satellites (1986). The album, dedicated to Wilson, had taken nearly three years to complete but was worth the wait, serving up the fan favorites \"Summer of Love\" and \"Wig.\" As a period of mourning, Keith, switching from drums to guitar, gradually resumed writing music for a new album. Working together on vocal melodies, lyrics and arrangements for the new tracks, Keith, Kate, Fred and Cindy re-emerged with the Don Was/Nile Rodgers co-produced Cosmic Thing (1989). The album proved to be the greatest commercial achievement for the group, and its success propelled the band to international superstars. Cosmic Thing soared to the top of the Billboard Album chart, sold five million copies and yielded their first-ever Hot 10 hits \u2014 \"Love Shack\" and \"Roam\" and a Top 40 hit with \"Deadbeat Club.\" The B-52s advanced their reputation as the greatest party band on the planet to a whole new generation of music fans. They played to sold-out audiences worldwide on a tour that would last more than 18 months, including an Earth Day gig before nearly 750,000 people in New York City's Central Park. Soon after, Cindy Wilson amicably departed. \"I'd been a B-52 for a long time, and it just felt like time for a change,\" said Cindy. Before long, Wilson had successfully completed her first solo project \u2014 a baby girl. Meanwhile, Kate collaborated with other artists, including Athens compatriots R.E.M., for whom she guest-starred on their 1991 album Out of Time. She also scored a hit with fellow CBGB's alum Iggy Pop on his lovelorn duet \"Candy.\" Fred, meanwhile started work on a solo project, Just Fred (1996), with producer Steve Albini, his second solo project since the release of 1984\u2019s Fred Schneider and the Shake Society. As a trio, Fred, Keith and Kate re-enlisted the tag team of Was and Rodgers to produce the energetic Good Stuff (1992). With it\u2019s popular title cut and concert favorite \"Is That You Mo-Dean?,\" Good Stuff is more than just a worthy follow-up to Cosmic Thing: the album stands as the group's most overtly political album. \"We're out there to entertain people,\" said Fred, \"but it's great to get people thinking and dancing at the same time.\" Reuniting permanently with Cindy, the B-52s wrote and recorded two new tracks that fit perfectly into Time Capsule, a 1998 stellar collection of hits. The first single from the Best Of collection, \"Debbie\" is a metaphorical tribute to band friend and supporter Debbie Harry and the whole CBGB's scene of the late '70s. With the release of the two-disc collection Nude on the Moon: the B-52s Anthology (2002), the B-52s took much-deserved credit for a body of work that is unique, beloved and timeless in its own way. The B-52s influence cuts a wide path through much of so-called 'modern rock' \u2014 from the low-fi efforts of nouveau garage bands to the retro-hip of ultra-lounge, to the very core of dance music itself. \"We just did our own thing, which was a combination of rock 'n 'roll, funk, and Fellini, and game show host, and corn, and mysticism,\" says Fred. It is indeed all these things (and much more). In 2008 the B-52s released their first new album in 16 years, the aptly titled Funplex. With its primal guitar hooks, driving drums and the B-52s' unmistakable vocal style, Funplex is instantly recognizable as quintessential and contemporary B-52s. Newsweek Magazine declared, \u201cLike a sonic shot of vitamin B12, the dance floor beats, fuzzy guitar riffs and happy, shiny lyrics keep the energy going.\u201d As the B-52s continue to take their party-music revolution into the 21st century they show no signs of slowing down, serving up their own unique blend of music and showmanship to millions of fans around the world.

He not only plays guitar, sings, writes songs and produces Grammy-winning albums, but does it all with an easy agility that erases any seeming genre boundaries between country, blues, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, pop, folk, R&B and bluegrass. A consistent presence on the upper reaches of the country chart hit parade for the last three decades, his associations and collaborations read like an honor roll of notable talent in country and beyond: George Strait, Ringo Starr, Garth Brooks, Jeff Bridges, Robert Plant, B.B. King, Fleetwood Mac, Gregg Allman, The Judds, Buddy Guy, Neil Diamond, Patty Griffin, Bonnie Raitt, Del McCoury, The Neville Brothers, Vince Gill, Delbert McClinton, Etta James, John Prine, Keb\u2019 Mo\u2019 and Toby Keith are just some of the many artists who number among the more than 500 recordings of songs written or co-written by Nicholson. His songs have been heard in the movies Crazy Heart, Major League, City of Hope, Message in a Bottle and Where the Heart Is. \u201cI\u2019m always curious about working with different people and styles,\u201d he says.\n\nAsked what makes a song connect no matter what the style, Nicholson explains, \u201cI think it\u2019s all about communication, if you can get an emotional response from people, get them to laugh or cry. And make an impression that\u2019s memorable.\u201d\n\nHe is also a true blue son of the Lone Star State whose love and pride for the place he calls home brims from every track of his Bismeaux Records album, Texas Songbook. Recorded in the Republic\u2019s capital city of Austin with some of the finest players in the state, it features such Texan guest stars as Joe Ely, McClinton, Marcia Ball, Randy Rogers, Ray Benson and Jason Roberts of Asleep at the Wheel on songs inspired by or about Texas by Nicholson himself and penned with Texans like the late Stephen Bruton, McClinton, Guy Clark, Lee Roy Parnell and others. It\u2019s sure to satisfy any and all with a taste for swinging, two-stepping, and dancehall and honky-tonk style Lone Star country music.\n\nThe album leaps into a Lone Star state of mind from the opening track, \u201cTexas Weather,\u201d and keeps the theme dancing though such other numbers as \u201cShe Feels Like Texas,\u201d \u201cA Woman in Texas, A Woman in Tennessee,\u201d \u201cLone Star Blues\u201d (with Ely and Benson singing along, and just recorded by George Strait for his next album), \u201cTalkin\u2019 Texan\u201d and \u201cTexas Ruby\u201d (with Ball on piano). The set includes the signature song \u201cFallin\u2019 & Flyin\u2019\u201d from Crazy Heart, the infectiously swinging \u201cMessin\u2019 With My Woman\u201d (with backing vocals by Benson and Roberts), \u201cSame Kind of Crazy\u201d (written with McClinton, who plays harmonica on the track and cut the song, as did George Strait on his Twang album), and \u201cListen to Willie\u201d (a tribute to the Red-Haired Stranger with Stoney LaRue and Benson on vocals and Mickey Raphael on harmonica). It wraps up with \u201cBless Them All\u201d (with the McCrary Sisters), \u201cLive, Laugh, Love\u201d (previously recorded by Texan Clay Walker), and the closing grace note of \u201cSome Days You Write the Song\u201d (the title song of the Grammy-nominated Guy Clark album, co-written with Clark and Jon Randall Stewart).\n\nNicholson\u2019s impetus for making Texas Songbook was his recent induction into the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to make a truly country record,\u201d he says of his fourth release in his own right. \u201cSo I figured, okay, if I\u2019m going to do this, I\u2019m going to do this in Texas with all Texas players and with songs co-written by Texans. I\u2019m just going to make the most Texas record I can possibly make and have fun doing it.\u201d\n\nTo do so, the first and only choice was to \u201cgo straight to Ray Benson.\u201d Recorded at Benson\u2019s Bismeaux Studio, the disc features Asleep at the Wheel members and associates Roberts (fiddle), David Sanger (drums), Floyd Domino (piano) and Kevin Smith (bass) as well as steel guitarist Tommy Detamore and accordion player Joel Guzman. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have made this record in Nashville and gotten this music,\u201d notes Nicholson, a Music City resident for now more than three decades. \u201cI could have come close. But I knew I could only make this album in Texas.\u201d Plus for good measure include in the creative mix some honorary Texans from the state\u2019s \u201cnorth 40\u201d of Oklahoma like guest singer and Lone Star/Red Dirt music scene hero LaRue and Kevin Welch, co-writer of \u201cListen to Willie\u201d and now residing in the Hill Country town of Wimberley.\n\nThe trail that led Nicholson to becoming an integral and pervasive presence in the Nashville music industry and scene \u2014 and 26 ASCAP songwriting awards and nomination to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame \u2014 begins in Garland in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex where he came of age within the fertile musical context of the mid 1950s. \u201cMy older sister had all these rock \u2019n\u2019 roll records by Elvis, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran and more in her room. And I was forbidden to go into her room, so that\u2019s where I was whenever she left the house,\u201d Nicholson recalls.\n\nHe soon took up the guitar and started playing folk and country music, making his public debut in his school\u2019s eighth grade talent show and winning it. Then along came the Ventures and Nicholson took up electric guitar. When he later came to believe that the Beatles \u201cwere the greatest thing ever\u201d and heard area resident Freddie King, his fate was sealed.\n\nAs a teen he made his bones as a live music player in such British Invasion-inspired bands as the Valiants, the Catalinas and the Untouchables. He spent the summer of his 16th year playing Fort Worth\u2019s legendary club the Cellar, \u201cthe first gig I ever had and roughest gig I ever played,\u201d Nicholson notes.\n\nWhile studying at North Texas State University in nearby Denton, Nicholson fell in with such other musical fellow students as soon-to-be Eagle Don Henley and pianist/producer/arranger Jim Ed Norman, later president of the Warner Bros. Nashville label. He stayed busy by night in club and frat party bands, and was also recruited to tour with the Nazz after Todd Rundgren left the group. \u201cThey hired me because I had a Marshall stack and a Les Paul,\u201d Nicholson recalls with a chuckle.\n\nFollowing a night into the following day in 1971 hanging out and swapping songs with Gram Parsons on a swing through Dallas by the cosmic American-music pioneer and legend, Nicholson left college and, urged on by Parsons, moved with his band to Los Angeles. \u201cWe drove straight through to L.A. and went right to the Palomino club, got in the talent show and won it.\u201d That same night he also met and befriended such stalwarts of the burgeoning Southern California country-rock/roots scene as Delaney Bramlett, Glen Campbell (later among the many to cut a Nicholson song), guitar legend (and Nicholson inspiration) James Burton and master steel guitarist Red Rhodes.\n\nHis friends Henley and Norman soon followed as Nicholson went on to win his first publishing deal, scored his debut recorded cover by bluegrass star Doug Dillard, and inked a record deal with Kapp/MCA with his band, Uncle Jim\u2019s Music. They rehearsed in the same building as budding star Linda Ronstadt, whose producer John Boylan helmed the first of the band\u2019s two albums of Nicholson\u2019s songs (with Norman on keyboards for the second), prized by collectors.\n\nNot long after watching Henley join forces with Glenn Frey in Ronstadt\u2019s band and then soar to superstardom in the Eagles, Nicholson married his college sweetheart Barbara and headed back to Texas in 1973. Despite the artistic boom in California, \u201cI liked the music back in Texas better,\u201d he notes. One reason why was an album by locals and fellow expatriates to L.A. who would also return home, Delbert & Glen (Clark).\n\nNicholson wound up doing stints as a guitarist in McClinton\u2019s band throughout the rest of the 1970s. He also started a group called Hot Sauce that melded country-rock and blues and were sometimes joined by his guitar hero Freddie King at their weekly Sunday residency at Mother Blues in Dallas. He also sharpened his Western swing and country chops taking gigs throughout North Texas, and continued to hone his songwriting skills.\n\nThen Norman tapped a Nicholson song, \u201cJukebox Argument,\u201d for a recording by Mickey Gilley that ended up on the Urban Cowboy 2 soundtrack. His friend then invited him to relocate to Nashville to write for his publishing company in 1980. By 1984 he had joined the roster of legendary writers at Tree Publishing and nabbed his first No. 1 cut with \u201cThat\u2019s the Thing About Love\u201d by Don Williams. He has since written or co-written scores of country chart songs including such Top 10 gems as \u201cOne More Last Chance\u201d (Vince Gill), \u201cThe Trouble With the Truth\u201d (Patty Loveless), \u201cShe Couldn\u2019t Change Me\u201d (Montgomery Gentry) and Reba\u2019s \u201cWhen Love Gets a Hold of You.\u201d Nicholson is a prolific collaborator and has enjoyed the honor of writing with and having his songs recorded by other numerous lauded singer-songwriters.\n\nNicholson showcased his skills as a producer on his 1995 solo debut, The Sky Is Not the Limit. Four albums for McClinton followed, two of them Grammy winners (Best Contemporary Blues Album) and another nominated, and to date the longtime friends have written some 40 songs together that Delbert has recorded. His other noteworthy productions include T. Graham Brown\u2019s acclaimed Wine Into Water, New Day Dawning by Wynonna and the landmark Reunion by the Judds as well as discs by Chris Knight, Seth Walker and Pam Tillis plus Marcia Ball\u2019s latest album, among others.\n\nSoon after arriving in Music City Nicholson did his first session as a guitarist. His credit can be found on numerous albums since, especially when a taste of Texas C&W and blues is called for. He toured out of Nashville in his early years there with Guy Clark, Billy Joe Shaver, Tracy Nelson and Gail Davies until Bobby Bare advised him to leave his band and better spend his time at home writing songs. Now that his sons are grown, Nicholson is back out on the road and with his band Fortunate Sons, who put out an album in 2010, as well as gigging and making a record under his nom de blues Whitey Johnson. As Texas Songbook hits the market, he also gathers together a country band to share stages with Asleep at the Wheel over the summer of 2011.\n\nTexas Songbook follows the form of his previous Nashville Songbook album that collected a number of Nicholson\u2019s top country covers in his own versions. Given his Lone Star State roots, his latest disc is a truly special endeavor for the multi-talented musical artist. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of it,\u201d he concludes. \u201cIt\u2019s very important stuff for me. As great as Nashville is and has been to me, it will never take the place of Texas in my heart.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "135 San Carlos St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Kyd The Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8343650.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.890837, 37.334762], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "San Jose Civic", "moreBioInfo": "instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kydtheband twitter: http://www.twitter.com/kydtheband youtube: http://www.youtube.com/kydtheband", "otherInfo": "Doors at 7:00pm"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "Virlan Garcia", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Oracle Arena", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "20990 Homestead Rd, Cupertino, CA 95014", "Artist": "Esha K", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8975156.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.040382, 37.336297], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Pop Singer-Songwriter, Classic Rock, Pop, Singer, Songwriter, Indie Pop, Alternative, Acoustic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Homestead Bowl & The X Bar", "moreBioInfo": "An upcoming singer-songwriter from the San Francisco Bay Area, Esha K. creates a unique blend of heartfelt lyrics, powerful vocals, and catchy guitar riffs.

The friction between these impulses is where good things happen, and it\u2019s the place San Francisco\u2019s The Stone Foxes - spear headed by brothers Shannon Koehler (drums, harp, vocals) and Spence Koehler (lead guitar, vocals) ) - have resided since their 2008 debut, young men dedicated to keeping rock engaged and succulently alive.\n\n\u201cYou do what the song needs you to do. That\u2019s how this band does it,\u201d says Shannon. \u201cHell, that\u2019s how The Band did it! You can go back to Muddy Waters and further for examples of this. With us, there\u2019s this filter of blues and roots that we\u2019ve created by soaking up that music, and when we write everything gets put through that filter. It comes out as who we are today, but everything we do goes through that filter, this cultural fuzzbox.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s third record, Small Fires , released in February of 2013, is a cohesive, compelling distillation of all the learning the quartet has been doing on the road the past two years since 2010\u2019s Bears & Bulls, an evolution that harnesses their significant firepower with and wrestle with the idea of conflicts, big and small.\n\n\u201cFor sure it\u2019s economically and politically driven, but there are still a few relationship songs in there,\u201d chuckles Shannon. \u201cWith earlier albums, we were more concerned with how the music sounded than any underlying themes. This time we took the lyric writing to a new place. I think we\u2019re getting better at defining who we are.\u201d With producer Doug Boehm (Girls, Dr. Dog, The Vines), The Stone Foxes cut 12 songs in 12 days at Los Angeles\u2019 Carriage House, a whirlwind pace that kept things popping in real time, ideas coming fast and furious, bits of lightning captured in whatever bottle was handy.\n\nOn this past tour in support of Small Fires the Stone Foxes put action to their politically driven lyrics by teaming up with SuperFood Drive to help raise awareness of hunger and homelessness in each city they visited on tour. According to SuperFood Drive 1 out of 6 people visit a food pantry because they can\u2019t afford to buy food. 50% of these people are children. This same population also tends to suffer from obesity and chronic illness like diabetes and heart disease. At every show the band encouraged fans to bring healthy nutrient filled non-perishable food, and teamed up with a local food bank where the band personally delivered all the food that was collected at the shows.\n\nWhile working with SuperFood drive the Stone Foxes embarked on a very unique musical collaboration with food bank and food shelter patrons. \u201cThe first recording we did at a shelter was a man named Charles who had lived under a freeway\u201d reports Shannon Koehler, \u201che sang our song about cold nights in the city. After we stopped rolling, he called me over and told me how much the song meant to him. You don't forget things like that. Goose bumps and watery eyes were the norm at these sessions. At shelters on tour and at home in San Francisco, people who know hard times have sang with us and shared their stories. It's been an honor to listen. We're just trying to share their voices.\u201d These special recordings will be released in late November in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nAs for right now the Stone Foxes are focused almost solely on writing. \u201cDuring shows we'll be trying out some new stuff, \u201c says Shannon \u201cand then we'll huddle back in the studio and start cranking the stuff out. We're really excited about the sound. The rock is raw, blues is the filter.

His music, however, remains rooted in his blue collar beginnings, with lyricism that embraces the day-to-day, the mundane, the beauty of the ordinary. Before moving to Austin, TX and launching his career as a working-class folk musician, Matt Sever grew up on the West Coast. His parents played John Denver and Pete Seeger songs on the family record player, and Matt spent his earliest years surrounded by the things that would later fill his own music: acoustic guitars, timeless melodies, lyrics that celebrated the joys and heartaches of everyday life, and \u2014 above all else \u2014 a strong work ethic. That work ethic served him well in the mid-1990s, when he moved to Austin in search of new horizons and better opportunities. Matt was already playing music by then, and in need of a steady day job, he began working as an electrician, spending his days wiring houses in the Texas heat. Once quitting time came, he'd grab his guitar and drive himself to an evening show, usually taking the stage in his work boots and sweaty clothes. \"Hi; I'm Matt the Electrician,\" he'd tell the crowd, hoping his occupation would help explain his appearance. The name stuck, even after his growing fan base at home, as well as abroad, allowed him to hang up his pliers for good.

Norton and Edward A. Williams had been through a number of musical endeavours individually - including duos - and the prospect of a new project sounded intriguing. As details were hashed out, the core principles became readily evident: have fun and tour often. With a large stable of strong self and co-written songs and a prominent mission statement, Ash and Ed were ready to embark on a new journey. All that was needed was a name.\n\nAgain, a question: \u201cHow about \u2018whitherward\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe name took quickly, gaining a life of its own; within days, a website was created, local shows were booked, recordings were done, and a small tour was constructed. It was exciting and validating; a musical project where the sky was the limit, and no challenge seemed insurmountable.\n\nThen, after surveying the current outlook of their career, a new question arose: \u201cWhat if we toured full-time?\u201d\n\nIt would mean a lot of sacrifice - regular work schedules would be scuttled, permanent housing foregone, and material possessions reduced to a minimum. The performance requirements of sustaining a full-time tour would be grueling, and the workload more than doubles when considering the financial commitment required of being on the road indefinitely.\n\nBut amongst all the new responsibilities and stresses, there\u2019s an inherent mystery about the open road - from a typical human vantage, it\u2019s impossible to see what is around the next bend, over the next hill. In an ironic twist, this provides a startling clarity about life and how it can be lived - as so many people profess - day by day. When you can only see as far as the next hill, it somehow manages to decrease the amount of worry about what\u2019s on the other side. Rather, it helps to build a sense of wonder for what\u2019s over there, and you want to keep pushing to see it for yourself.\n\nThe duo now has four self-produced, self-published EPs full of intricate, thoughtful music, putting the emotions of life on the road and outside of the box on display. A full length album is in the works. New collaborations with bassist Patrick Hershey and violinist Stephanie Groot on both the 4th EP and the upcoming full-length album expand the sonic landscape of the duo\u2019s efforts. In addition to playing over 200 shows a year, their travels enable them to reach a number of diehard fans, new destinations, and old friends that serve to grow an ever-expanding audience.\n\nWhitherward is an Old English adverb that means \u201cin which direction\u201d. The word seems to invite an eternal question; it feels like the perfect fit for a duo that constantly seeks to reinvent itself in every aspect of its existence, always looking for the next impossible question to answer. There is forward; there is backward; and then there is Whitherward.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "The-Stone-Foxes", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "This show is 21+ / Doors at 8:00 PM.

One of the first bands in the cross over thrash metal genre, They released their debut album Fools Game back in 1989. Fool's Game gave birth to the hit single Everyday\u2019s A Holiday, a huge crowd pleaser at the live shows; it also yielded a video which played in heavy rotation on MTV & other music stations internationally in addition to helping secure a successful American/European tour supporting the likes of Sacred Reich, Overkill, Nuclear Assault and Celtic Frost. In 1991 came their second album, In This Life, which garnered 5 star reviews like Kerrang magazine's https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1389669184606211.1073741830.1377819649124498&type=3 This album spawned 2 hit singles, Falling Away & Esse Quam Videri. Both videos for the singles enjoyed heavy rotation on MTV and worldwide. Touring for support of In This Life produced a live home video, In This LIVE, from one of their amazing headlining shows at the Marquee club in London which sold out both nights. 1992 arrived & Mordred release the 6 track EP that was Vision. The EP included a wide variety of the crossover thrash sound & again enjoyed lots of radio exposure.

What they have inevitably divulged through their accomplishments is that when a Bay Area rave specialist and a British transplant with a classical music background come together, the resulting dynamism is no illusion. Manny Alferez and Phil Collis have artfully dedicated the focus of their wizardry to a shared passion for electronic music, and Sleight of Hands beams as a beacon of fresh disco-laden house sounds that is here to stay. Neither Manny nor Phil was a stranger to the electronic music game. Manny staked his everlasting claim in the Bay Area community in 1990 as a key promoter and DJ, roles for which he took on the abbreviated appellation of M3, short for \u201cMakes Me Move\u201d. The M3 sound began as a fluid, down-tempo approach and eventually evolved to become a funk-charged expression of house and tech-bangers for which he is so well-known today. Manny quickly developed his own legendary party brand known as Green Gorilla and progressed to sharing the decks with industry icons such as Marshall Jefferson, Derrick Carter, Cajmere, Mark Farina, and Rick James. A well-deserved social buzz led M3 to notoriety which would land him bookings across the globe; this further developed Manny\u2019s acumen for rhythm and cultural finesse, which set the stage for his bond with multifaceted performing arts crackerjack, Phil Collis. Growing up with the sounds of Beethoven, Abba and Queen meant Phil\u2019s musical destiny would be one with diverse chapters. By the early age of seven, he was already heralded a child prodigy and performing classical piano music to audiences across the UK. By the age of nine Phil was inducted into the esteemed Royal Academy of Music and by the age of twelve he had already been tapped for his acting abilities starring in roles alongside Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Liam Neeson. But it was electronic music that would truly capture his heart and he strove to achieve transition. Finally, it was at one of Collis\u2019 appearances that a deranged and confused fan unleashed a physical attack after failure to perform \u201cSussudio\u201d; this would serve as the tipping point to inspire an artistic identity change, and Phil promptly funneled his efforts into founding his first band, Bachelors of Science. Like M3, Phil\u2019s earlier approach to electronic music was a silky one, and Bachelor\u2019s of Science quickly became one of the pioneers of the \u201cliquid funk\u201d genre while experimenting with a soulful approach to drum n\u2019 bass. Upon moving to San Francisco, Phil quickly became engrossed in the captivating house beats oozing from the subwoofer that was the Bay Area, instantly pointing him to Green Gorilla and M3. When each of them realized that the other was stupidly awesome, shared visions prevailed and a collaborative enterprise was born. With best-selling remixes completed for international superstars Groove Armada and Dirty Vegas, the duo has made quite an industrious mark in a very short period of time. The impact of holding multiple #1 spots on Beatport proved prosperous, landing Sleight of Hands 2013 performance slots at world-renowned festivals such as Outside Lands and Coachella. Their magical musical approach to stylistic fusion makes listeners realize that the synergetic skills of Manny and Phil are anything but bluff. Today, relentless dedication in the studio along with a solid DJ residency at world-renowned SF nightlife staple, Monarch, continues to launch Sleight of Hands toward intergalactic success. For their next trick, they will feature a series of releases on illustrious underground record label, Smoke n\u2019 Mirrors. First in line is their premier twelve-inch EP, a trippy deep house number called \u201cAll Night\u201d, followed by \u201cSometimes\u2019 and \u201cSeal the Deal\u201d, two garage-infused chuggers with just enough grime to set off a dance floor. It can only be projected that there is plenty more mystifying amazingness to come from this enchanting doublet in the near future, so keep your ears open and your eyes sharp. Cards are officially out on the table and the stakes are high, so you\u2019d better be watching.

You can hear it on single \u201cOrbits\u201d when she sings, \u201cEverything you are is a miracle.\u201d The track, which references Carl Sagan\u2019s infamous golden records of the star-bound Voyager probes, also speaks to the other miracles of creation \u2014 youth, love, and humanity. It\u2019s this particular blend of boundless awe and cosmic curiosity that Claire George channels into her work, and that makes her new EP, Bodies Of Water, so engaging. Across the EP\u2019s five self-written and self-produced tracks, she combines an imaginative melodic sensibility with swirling electronic productions, crafting a clear vision for her debut.\n\nClaire\u2019s voice will be familiar to some in the electronic space. She\u2019s previously worked as a topliner, providing the vocal lines to tracks by dance artists Luttrell, Valy Mo, LP Giobbi and others. She also formerly served as the lead singer for the San Francisco act HEARTWATCH, but after disbanding in 2016, Claire decided to turn her focus inward. Seeking space and seclusion, she moved north for a quieter setting outside Seattle, near where she grew up. \u201cAt the same time my band split, I went through a break-up and a series of family traumas, quit my job, and left my community in San Francisco,\u201d she said. \u201cI had always been an extrovert, so living in isolation for a year and a half was a huge change for me. It was a period of solitude unlike any other I had ever experienced in my life.\u201d\n\nComing to grips with her self-imposed stillness, Claire struggled with anxiety and feelings of groundlessness, which she channeled into her musical practice. As a songwriter, she was used to having other voices in the room, whether working with her former band or with producers on vocal collaborations, but this was the first time she was writing, recording and producing entirely on her own, from the ground up. Moreover, while major cities like San Francisco are stimulating, they can also be noisy; so often the inspiration we find when surrounded by the output of our contemporaries also clouds our creative point-of-view. Detached from her previous projects and surroundings, Claire was able to experiment freely. \u201cThis was the first time the genesis of a song started entirely from me, so I just really allowed myself to explore,\u201d she said. \u201cThe creation process felt like a form of meditation, though often extremely frustrating. I was still learning how to produce as I was writing and creating, so everyday was a new experience with new challenges.\u201d\n\nThough difficult, the solitude proved rewarding, and Claire was able to find and refine her voice in the process. In 2018, she felt the present creative chapter closing and decided to relocate to Southern California to finish the material she had generated over the past two years.\n\nClaire\u2019s diligent approach paid off, resulting in the singularly captivating Bodies Of Water EP. Opener \u201cWhere Do You Go?\u201d serves as an introduction to her reflective lyrics and shimmering electronic atmospheres. \u201cOrbits,\u201d a low-key pop jewel that swells around an ingenious vocal sample and a swooning chorus, was featured on a recent compilation from Kitsun\u00e9, and appears here as the lead single. Claire similarly shines on the winsome and considerably more uptempo \u201cSecond Guesses,\u201d as well as the synth-driven, slow-burning album closer \u201cLonely Or Alone.\u201d\n\nThematically, Claire paints an impressionistic picture of the transformative journey of love, the traumas surrounding the loss of youth and the ambivalence at the intersection of the two. \u201cThis record reflects a lot on changing relationships and on the role of solitude in developing a closer relationship to oneself,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole project is influenced heavily by my need to look inward, to understand isolation intimately, to come to terms with changing relationships, and to build a healthy relationship with myself.\u201d Claire weaves those threads of self-awareness throughout the EP, from her deft production, to her striking vocal delivery, to her subtly nuanced perspective. Overall, Bodies Of Water is an undeniably strong body of work from a confident new voice, made all the more wondrous with each repeat listen.\n\nBodies Of Water is out November 16, 2018 on Cascine.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3700 Blackhawk Plaza Cir, Danville, CA 94506", "Artist": "The Breakfast Klub", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8337923.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.917109, 37.801518], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: 80s New Wave, Party Rock and Dance Hits", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Blackhawk Museum", "moreBioInfo": "TBK is Northern California and Nevada's Premier 80s Tribute band.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name).

As his DJ career flourished and house music grew in popularity, Franky's passion drove him to production where he made his first track in 1996 and he has been hooked ever since. Franky has produced music for OM Records, Transport Records, Look At You, Chez Music and Purple Music. \"As a DJ I always had ideas of how I would like to hear the music I was playing. House is not only a style of music it enhances music of all kinds. I love jazz, gospel, disco, funk, Motown, Latin and Brazillian beats and being a producer allows me to work with all of them.\" In addition to his many productions Franky still loves being a DJ and after packing clubs across Europe and the U.S. began a residency at his own club, Pink. \"Pink came about because my partner and I wanted to create an environment that is conducive to the beauty of house music. Sexy, beautiful, international and pure Pink represents everything and everyone. There isn't a dress code but there is a vibe code, for if you can create this vibe, you can have it all, all of the elements that make the music what it is.\" The opening of Pink in San Francisco was the beginning of Franky\u2019s career as a club owner. Franky wanted to create an environment that brought all lovers of house music together under one roof with the love and compassion that the music he plays possesses. Franky created a state of the art DJ booth that made admirers of well respected DJs from all over the world. Franky\u2019s musical creativity was expressed in unimaginable ways such as bringing the entire Glide Memorial Church Choir to sing at Pink. After four years of building a life long dream Franky decided to move on to other ventures leaving behind a legendary mark on San Francisco nightlife. Franky has continued his residencies with WET LA, Winter Music Conference, Coachella and annual tours in Europe and Mexico. Through his travels Franky has found inspiration to create new sounds and promote new parties like Scuba. Scuba started out as a Naked Music party with resident DJs Miguel Migs, Mauricio Aviles and other world renowned DJs. Scuba was created by bringing together technical and complex beats with the natural beauty of instrumentals. This ensemble found a home with the well-respected label and thus took on a life of it\u2019s own as a weekly party. Franky\u2019s music can be described as octophonic, a blend of funky beats with a deepness to it. The music has a beautiful melody and most importantly a sexy sound that touches and speaks to the soul. Franky\u2019s vision has always been to blend all genres and eras of music into a musical voyage to dance and get down to. From salsa, disco, soul, gospel and sometimes rock to jazz, and French hip hop from the 90\u2019s. Franky\u2019s goal is to engage people into the music with familiarity of the rhythm like a memory waiting to be released. \u201cI believe (in fact I know) that the deeper you go the higher you get. Once you connect with this sound it will definitely speak to you. I feel it\u2019s a San Francisco sound that reflects in our everyday life here in this amazing city, but also the vibe of all San Francisco residents and especially local music lovers. House music is translated through our love for each other, through the human interest in all of us from different places on this planet. We all have this \"special vibe\" in common and house music brings it out of us.\u201d A special thank you to friends, artist and labels that have been a part of Franky Boissy\u2019s musical journey: Miguel Migs, Julius Papp, Louie Vega, Derrick Carter, Dimitri From Paris, Jask, Osanlade, Soulfuric, Kenny Dope, Jazzanova, Ben Watt, DJ Afro (Los Amigos Invisible), Mr V, Crazy Pennis, David Harness, Naked Music, Lisa Shaw, Michael Watford, Roland Clark, Jay J, Chris Lum, Marques Wyatt, Chez Music, Rocco, Giant Step, Mark Farina, Bob Sinclar, Luis Radio, Michell Week, Purple Music, OM Records, Lazy Dog, and countless others\u2026 \u00a9 2010 Franky Boissy Thanks for following my music page!

Chief Monk Boudreaux is one of the most famous and enduring leaders of that culture and head of the Golden Eagle Mardi Gras Indian tribe. He admitted that he shared those feelings of confusion related to those traditions that he embraced long before he fully grasped them. \u201cMy dad used to mask as an Indian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe would get up at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, help him make his dress, watch him when he\u2019d leave, stay out there, and wait for him to come back. As I got older, I started wondering why he was doing that. I never asked, but I knew there had to be a reason. \u201cThen I started building up my own Indian suit. I was 12 years old. My dad had stopped, so I went with another tribe. I was chief scout the first year. The second year I was spyboy. It\u2019s a feeling you can\u2019t explain, because it\u2019s something deep inside of you.\u201d Boudreaux noted that his elders never spoke of the history of their traditions. \u201cThe older people didn\u2019t talk about it. They were scared that if someone found out they were Indians, they would send them off to the reservations. Mardi Gras day was the only day that you could come out and be who you really were. My grandmother\u2014my mother\u2019s mom\u2014she was on her dying bed. She called mom and said, \u2018Tell Joseph not to leave until I get there.\u2019 That\u2019s when she told me we were Choctaw Indians. I was 27 or 28 years old at that time. Then I knew why I was doing it.\u201d Indeed, the history of the Mardi Gras Indian culture in New Orleans is complex, and accounts of its origins are sometimes inconsistent. An affinity shared between Native American and African American people, both of whom were enslaved and persecuted at various times in the city\u2019s history, was clearly a driving force in those origins and the mixing of their cultures. Both ethnic groups also share an appreciation of tradition, and the unique New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian music, costumes, and rituals are a melding of influences from both cultures. The costumes provide a spectacular visual backdrop that comes from the detailed and devoted efforts of the participants. Boudreaux explained the effort involved in preparing those costumes. \u201cYou start off with a piece of canvas,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou find a picture that you really like or you can draw something out of your imagination. You draw it on the canvas, and then you start beading. Just as if you were coloring something, you outline it. After you outline it you start filling in the colors. Then you go around it with rhinestones and start filling it out. \u201cYou cut a jacket out of canvas, then you cover it with velvet. You line it with satin. You start putting your patches on. Then you make ruffles out of velvet, and start going around your patches with velvet ruffles. And that\u2019s it!\u201d Boudreaux confided that the costumes take about eight or nine months to complete. One of the greatest concerns regarding the continuity of the Mardi Gras Indian tradition is whether subsequent generations will have the patience and devotion required to preserve it. As for the music, Boudreaux was at first influenced by his elders in the neighborhood. \u201cAll lot of the older men in the neighborhood used to sing every day,\u201d said Boudreaux. \u201cErnie Benson, the blues singer, used to live in the neighborhood. His dad used to sing every day. I would come home from school, sit on the step, and listen to him sing. Another old man would sing everywhere he went. I would just walk behind him and listen.\u201d In terms of celebrities, one memorable star sparked his interest in pursuing music in a more dedicated manner. \u201cWhen I was a kid, the first person that I heard that really inspired me about music was Al Jolson. I was real young then\u2014about seven or eight years old. I used to just love to hear that man sing.\u201d As he became involved with the Indians, one of his mentors taught him a number of songs with the realization that he would one day be the chief. Soon thereafter, Boudreaux realized that he had a gift in terms of both performance and creativity. \u201cI started off singing Indian songs,\u201d he said. \u201cLater on I realized that I could sing just about anything that I wanted to. I could create my own music, and lyrics just come to me. If something stays on my mind, I can make a song out of it.\u201d Boudreaux is known for his long-time collaboration with Big Chief Bo Dollis and the Wild Magnolia group, though he left the group nearly a decade ago to form the Golden Eagle Mardi Gras Indians. His latest album Rising Sun is a collaboration with Reverend Goat Carson, a professed \u201cRenegade Cherokee.\u201d As one might expect, the musical influences are diverse. \u201cIt\u2019s like a gumbo,\u201d said Boudreaux. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of everything in it.\u201d Like so much of New Orleans music, an essential element is the appropriate rhythm that evokes participation from the audience. \u201cI have them hoppin\u2019 and jumpin\u2019 and havin\u2019 a good time,\u201d Boudreaux laughed. \u201cBecause they love the music and they love what I do. You can tell how they\u2019re feeling by their reaction.\u201d He has found that great music can induce such emotions even with reluctant participants. \u201cIf you sit down and listen to Indian music and it\u2019s got the right beat, it does something to you,\u201d he added. \u201cOne time I was performing at a club in New York. A guy told me, \u2018Monk, do you realize what you\u2019ve done? You\u2019ve got people dancing that don\u2019t dance.\u2019\u201d The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival has increased the visibility of the music of the Mardi Gras Indians, a fitting reward, given their integral role in the festival during its infancy. \u201cWe started Jazz Fest from day one,\u201d said Boudreaux. \u201cQuint (Davis, the Director of Jazz Fest) had us going out in the French Quarter to get people to come back to Jazz Fest. There are a lot of people at Jazz Fest looking for talent, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of gigs from that. It\u2019s been happening for a long time.\u201d Like many artists, Boudreaux finds music to be a cathartic tool and a vehicle of expression in post-Katrina New Orleans. \u201cThe music now is more powerful. A lot of guys came back to be here where they were born into this music. And they\u2019re putting everything they have into it. You can play your music somewhere else, but you won\u2019t have that feeling that you have in New Orleans. Because this is where the music was born.\u201d Music has also become a vehicle for raising awareness of the plight of coastal erosion, a dynamic that contributed to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, accelerated in its aftermath. Boudreaux joined forces with blues guitarist and singer/songwriter Tab Benoit and an all-star band of musicians in the project \u201cVoice of the Wetlands.\u201d The group recorded and performed songs aimed at raising awareness of this issue that is central to the viability of the region. \u201cReuben Williams, my manager, is Tab\u2019s manager also. When I start singing, Tab gets up there and starts playing guitar like he\u2019s been doing this music all of his life. We did two albums for Voice of the Wetlands to let people know what\u2019s happening down here.\u201d Boudreaux closed by passing on a message to Jazz Fest visitors regarding the never-ending access to music and celebration during the festival period. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a good time, then New Orleans is the place to be. And Jazz Fest is really the place to be. When Jazz Fest is over, you can go to any club and they\u2019ll be getting\u2019 down.

His dance music roots lie in Disco of the 70\u2019s and New Wave of the 80\u2019s. Presently living in San Francisco, he was born and raised in Montreal, Canada, and got tuned into dance music through the city\u2019s flourishing club scene and diverse radio broadcasts. He started collecting vinyl records in the mid 70\u2019s and took to the turntables in 1985, scoring his first major club gig two years later. Hearing the non-stop flow of music and observing the booth where the DJ seamlessly blended each selection were early influences for Julius. Later influences included reading about DJ residencies that were piloted by talented club music programmers that even today, influence the youngest of aspiring DJ\u2019s - legends like David Mancuso at The Loft & Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York City to Frankie Knuckles at The Warehouse in Chicago and Tony Humphries\u2019 weekly at Zanzibar in New Jersey. Always inspired by the music listed in those articles, Julius would shop for those titles that would later become classics, worshipped by their discerning audiences. To this day, his goal is to keep expanding his foundation in music by being open-minded and eclectic in absorbing the music that truly touches him. That open-minded attitude is what Julius uses to fine-tune his musical palette, which gives him a dominant sound that exudes a deep and soulful perspective. That dominant sound is (Soulful) House Music \u2013 which to him, is about an uplifting positive message. People coming together in unity, with no barriers or restrictions, but rather, with tolerance and the spirit of music, unifying everyone on the dance-floor. That being said, he blends various musical styles together - including Soul, Latin, Afro, Disco, Jazz and Electronic sounds with such fluidity, that it is difficult at times to put a defining stamp on his sound. Contributing to that is his willingness to take a chance. He always tries to push the envelope by introducing music that deserves exposure, taking his audience on a musical journey with various mood and energy changes. Not content to limiting his ambitions in the DJ booth, Julius began producing music in 1994. The studio was another outlet for Julius\u2019 creative ideas to flow. His first release was a down-tempo project on the Acid Jazz tip. He also drew attention as part of the jazz and funk scene in San Francisco via the Mushroom Jazz parties alongside resident Mark Farina. As Julius\u2019 production catalogue grew, so did the amount of labels he released music on including \u2013 long tenured labels like King ST (NYC), Nervous Records (NYC), Large Music (Chicago) and OM (SF), to signings on Soulfuric Recordings (FL) and Kenny Dope\u2019s \u201cDope Wax\u201d (NYC) label, as well as Bob Sinclar\u2019s own Yellow Productions in Paris. He also ventured into the label arena with his own \u201cNeoDisco Music\u201d imprint. Named after the sound that continues to inspire him \u2013 the label offers him an alternate outlet to release his own productions. As a veteran in the club scene, Julius has refined a style of dance music that has taken him beyond the boundaries of San Francisco to global praise and recognition. Being nominated as \u201cMost Innovative Producer\u201d at the 2004 House Music Awards is a perfect example of that. Putting him in the company of other nominated producers like, Joey Negro, Osunlade, DJ Gregory, DJ Spinna and Ben Watt was an absolute honor for him. Upcoming releases for 2014 include a compilation/mix CD entitled \u201cA Long Hot Summer\u201d on King ST Recordings (NYC) as well as Julius\u2019 next full-length, artist-album, plus several singles.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "1741 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Faultline", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7227816.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272359, 37.807461], "Date": "Sat Oct 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-26", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Metal, Electronic, Hard Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Rock Steady", "moreBioInfo": "Richmond VA\u2019s Faultline brings their brand of unapologetic rock without any frills or gimmicks, just confident vocals, actual melodic guitar playing and a steady backbeat.

From there, his focus has been divided between the studio, and playing away from home worldwide.\n\nHis ambitions as a boy were fired by visiting crooner Charles Azanavour\u2019s popularity with women, and Alexander the Great\u2019s world-conquering success: his parents introduced him to music from the Beach Boys to Pink Floyd, from old kitsch French records to punk, always as a communal sharing experience.

New bio good. Well, new bio just started, not sure if it's good yet or not. The deal is this: I've been on the road, making my living as a full time touring indie folk singin songwriter for about four years, give or take (depending on how flexible you're willing to be in your definition of \"a living,\" I guess). Before that I was a part-time touring folk singer and a part time recording studio engineer. Before that I was a full time recording studio engineer (also, at times, a part time cash register specialist at Whole Foods, a college student, a bank teller, the token female on the tech crew, a terrible waitress, Ruth in the Pirates of Penzance and a host of other things). As a rule I try not to put much stock in defining a person by their profession - a dangerous tendency that we have in this culture, I think - but since my brain, my heart, my music, my life, my ego, my livelihood and my identity are all kind of rolled up in one volatile little package that I load into a station wagon, drive all over the country and hoist on stage every night, it's sometimes hard to avoid. I'm working on it. I released a brand new CD last year, which is technically my 3rd but also the first full length I've recorded since going full time with the whole music thing. I think recording an album is kind of like falling in love -- everyone around you is doing it all the time (especially when you're a full time musician and so are a lot of your friends), but when it happens to you it feels like the largest, most singular and important occurrence of all time and space. But....I'm! Recording! An! Album!! It's very exciting. The album is called 'Mystery Prize,' it's out there in the world (even got a lil record deal in Europe, very exciting)! You can score your very own copy, should you care to, at my website or, better yet, at a live show! I'm updating this bio on the first day of autumn in 2011, sitting at the kitchen table of a kindly host's house in Tucson, AZ. Twenty eleven has been a potent year so far. I started with a month off, in an attempt to cleanse my mind/body/spirit after 4 straight years of touring. During that time I was invited to audition for a TV show called \"The Voice.\" I went on a whim and was asked to audition again in Los Angeles, this time in front of famous people. Next thing I knew I was face to face with Christina Aguilera and Adam Levine, talking about songwriting among other things, and 12 million people saw it on NBC. I was on the show for a couple episodes, left in a fashion that I am very comfortable with and since then I've been back on the road, doing what I've been doing for the past four -- almost five, now -- years. It's been great to see some new friendly faces at these shows, as well as having a chance to reconnect with the familiar ones. If you'd like to see me play live sometime, check out my tour schedule. I hope to slow down for a minute to record some new songs sometime soon, but I've always got a tour cookin, so keep an eye out! Hope you're doing well out there and that I get to see your pretty face smiling in some dimly lit theater, pristine acoustic listening room, dingy dive bar, college coffeehouse or campfire circle sometime soon. warm hugs, ~becca www.rebeccaloebe.com | music, tourdates www.rebeccaloebe.net | monthly live releases~ www.facebook.com/rebeccaloebe | you found it! www.twitter.com/rebeccaloebe | very short sentances Drop me a line: rebecca@rebeccaloebe.com Drop my college booking agent a line: jeff@degy.com Drop my promo dude a line: appleginpromotions@gmail.com Music @ https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/rebecca-loebe/id65202943", "otherInfo": "Matt The Electrician + Rebecca Loebe"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Lizzo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8995592.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "Genres: Feel Good Music in Portland", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Center", "moreBioInfo": "Born and Raised.\nMember of GRRRL PRTY", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Jenna Raine", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9383028.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "believer, singer, songwriter\nmy friends call me Nen\ninfo@jennaraine.com\n\"Be Like You\" out now: https://smarturl.it/listentobelikeyou", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Marco McKinnis", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9233434.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-hop, Hip Hop, HipHop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Lucky Daye"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Forming the Void", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9460969.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Heavy Rock, Stoner Rock, Doom, Progressive Rock, Progressive Metal", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "\"Progressive sludge metal that\u2019s dynamic, engaging and doesn\u2019t get too swept up in itself is hard to come by \u2014 so many bands try, and fail \u2014 but Louisiana\u2019s Forming the Void have done a fantastic job on their new effort Relic.\" - Vince Neilstein (MetalSucks)\n\n\"Their production is steadily geared toward maximum largeness, but the band does work effectively within that to enact a scope between the various tracks.

Raised in the era of Mob Music in the Bay Area, he pioneered the resurgence of party music in a time when content was all about violence. With a combination of uncanny timing and relentless work ethic, Carson became one of the biggest purveyors of the Bay Area\u2019s Hyphy Movement that brought his hometown back into the spotlight after nearly a decade of neglect from national attention.\n\n\n\nAfter a brief stint in New York to soak up the mixtape hustle, Carson put together a \u201cside project\u201d in 2002 that would later cement his contribution to the local hip hop industry. That \u201cside project\u201d was the creation of a group with fellow members Mayne Mannish, Jungle, and Kaz Kyzah called The Team. Battling at local radio stations gave the group enough recognition to earn a chance at making it to the airwaves, and after scoring major spins with their previously-mentioned single \u201cIt\u2019s Getting Hot\u201d, Carson proved that the Hyphy Movement was not something so easily categorized as a passing fad.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "SP's", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9511661.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463777, 37.783225], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Garage Rock, Art Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Neck Of the Woods", "moreBioInfo": "\"POST-PUNK BAND THE SP'S WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING NAZIS!

Established in 2011, Radiator King\u2019s music shows influences from both Dylan and Strummer with a sound described by Boston blog Allston Pudding as something akin to what \u201cTom Waits locked in a room for a month with nothing but a copy of Springstein\u2019s Nebraska\u201d might produce. Whether alone with a guitar or backed by a band, Radiator King embodies the raw energy of punk, the grit and intricacy of delta blues, and the lyrical potency of folk in \u201csongs that are the sonic equivalent to an old whiskey bar at the end of a dirt road.\u201d\n\nIn early 2017, Radiator King released his third full length album, A Hollow Triumph After All. The record is at once celebratory & somber, deftly channeling the mood of a Crescent City second line, that holy brass-anchored yin-yang jazz-funeral tradition of New Orleans. A sacred and profound attempt to transcend pain, loss and suffering by celebrating a life well-lived, while at once acknowledging the darkly tragicomic Catch 22 of existence\u2014that we\u2019re born to die.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all down here together,\u201d muses Adam Silvestri, the singer, songwriter and creative force behind Radiator King. \u201cWhat connects us is the strife we share in struggle. It unites us, it makes us do wonderful things. There\u2019s this proverb in Eastern philosophy\u2014within crisis is opportunity. I very much believe that. I think that what people connect with in music often has to do with pain. So building this record around the idea of a New Orleans funeral procession\u2014it\u2019s about finding a way to overcome the pitfalls in life, to face them straight on and find the beauty in doing that. That\u2019s what character is in my opinion. That\u2019s what integrity is. Those moments of crisis are where we learn what we\u2019re built of.\u201d\n\nA Boston native now hailing from New York, Silvestri has been featured at outlets such as Brooklyn Vegan, Punk News and Daytrotter. His latest Radiator King record was recorded at NYC\u2019s Vibromonk Studios by producer/engineer Jesse Cannon, and features an all-star cast of session players including drummer Brian Viglione (Dresden Dolls, NIN, Violent Femmes) and accordion player/keyboardist Franz Nicolay (The Hold Steady, World/Inferno Friendship Society). The bulk of the recordings were cut live to tape.\n\n\u201cWhen I was working on the demos for this album, I left a lot of room for interpretation,\u201d Silvestri says. \u201cI wanted people who would understand intuitively what I was going for, which is a tough thing, but Jesse helped me find the right people. Vibromonk is essentially a warehouse\u2014just this big open space. I wanted to deal with raw emotion. For musicians to follow their instincts and impulses. The beautiful moments in recording are unplanned\u2014when you lose yourself, and you\u2019re just playing and having a dialogue with the people around you.\u201d\n\nA Hollow Triumph After All is a journey in song, an affecting pastiche of Americana and indie rock: snaky, dissonant junkyard psychedelia; ebullient hook-heavy rock & roll; church-organ folk-punk dirges where there\u2019s more truth and salvation in the hangover than the sermon; weary ballads that at their most warmhearted-valiant approximate early Tom Waits and Springsteen\u2019s Nebraska, and at their creepiest, the hellfire-and-brimstone freak-folk of 16 Horsepower. Gluing together the genre-hopping record\u2019s varied styles is Silvestri\u2019s bleak, desperate and unmistakable wail, wizened beyond its years, delivering impressionistic lyrics that seem to emanate from the mystic chasm between wake and dream\u2026\n\nBarbed wire and black molasses\nMy palms sweat at the sight of it all\nThe low down docks of New Orleans\nWhere they almost trampled my soul\n\nWalking alone down 5th Street\nJust $5 that I saved\nI tore off my old raincoat\nand I left behind my name\nEdith can you see me now\nShaking in the cold\nWell I\u2019ve gone to meet my brothers\nwhere the Southern meets the Yellow Dog\n\nI watched a Harlem sunset\nthrough the cracks in my attic door\nI still hear the dogs bark in the hall where\nyou marked my height on the wall\n\nLyrically and conceptually, A Hollow Triumph is an exercise in the fleeting non-linear quantum leaping of memory. \u201cIt\u2019s this character walking through scenes in his life, experiences he\u2019s had,\u201d Silvestri explains. \u201cHe\u2019s searching for something. In the end, he\u2019s sort of depleted, exhausted, recollecting back on life and recognizing that the end destination he sought the whole time wasn\u2019t as important as he thought. Maybe it was all the little moments\u2014drinking with strangers at a roadside bar, falling for a girl in Memphis\u2014maybe these are the beautiful parts of life, and maybe he didn\u2019t pay enough attention to them while they were happening.\u201d\n\nSilvestri has been touring and recording as Radiator King since 2011, releasing 2012\u2019s Launching Day EP as well as 2015 debut LP Document Untold. Even on these earlier albums, he was honing in on everyday blue-collar experiences. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to telling stories of working-class people who embody some sort of integrity,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to find the underdog\u2014the person who\u2019s struggling or fighting for something. You try to put yourself in their shoes, but what you\u2019re really looking for when you\u2019re writing is where the point of connection lies\u2014 the essence of what makes these characters and their stories important to us, to our culture.\u201d\n\nSilvestri wrote most of A Hollow Triumph on tour\u2014in motel rooms, the van, wherever he could find some quiet. The songs are informed by the constant motion and the influx of new experiences that come with being on the road. \u201cI\u2019m always inspired when I\u2019m on tour,\u201d he says. \u201cYou meet people, you have these connections with strangers you\u2019d never cross paths with if you weren\u2019t playing a show. Often times they aren\u2019t very wealthy but they\u2019ll give you the shirt off their back, cook you food, let you stay on their living room floor..\u2026these people always inspire me. And when you\u2019re traveling, you can\u2019t help but notice how vast this country is. You\u2019re exposed to a lot of different cultures. It opens new doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Silvestri says, \u201cI consider myself fortunate to be a musician, to have the opportunity to travel to so many different places and play music for people. I know there\u2019s nothing that I\u2019m owed, but there are still people who will listen, people who open up their homes to you. This gets at the true sense of what music is all about\u2014it brings people together, it helps us connect.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Tell Me Tell Me, SP's, Radiator King, Horrible/Adorable at Neck of the Woods"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Levi Thomas", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7671011.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463777, 37.783225], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Roll, Americana, Psych Country, Country, Folk, Indie Americana, Psych Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Neck Of the Woods", "moreBioInfo": "Debut Single, \"The Fear\", out 5/5 via Rough Beast Records", "otherInfo": "Horrible/Adorable, SP's, Radiator King, Levi Thomas at Neck of the Woods"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Horrible/Adorable", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8746457.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463777, 37.783225], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Neck Of the Woods", "moreBioInfo": "2 girls who like to rock out and sparkle\n\noakland,CA\n\n\ncreamsoda dreamsicle pop rox", "otherInfo": "Tell Me Tell Me, SP's, Radiator King, Horrible/Adorable at Neck of the Woods"}, {"Address": "2344 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Bigtop", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/286448.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.434294, 37.763629], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Beaux", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Big Top\" at Beaux:"}, {"Address": "116 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Seisiun", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.460518, 37.783375], "Date": "Sun Oct 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Plough and the Stars", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Seisi\u00fan at Plough & Stars: Throwing back pints to a live soundtrack of traditional jigs and reels gives this Richmond watering hole a notably authentic Irish feel.

Passionately pursuing your dreams and consistent health habits still remain a big issue for the human race. Sadly many people do not find their purpose, and majority take their dreams to the graveyard. For example, you may already be aware of the news that 92% of people do not achieve their goals. 98% of people die without fulfilling their vision/ dreams. Only 6 percent of us achieve our childhood dreams (via Inc.). Additional research found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing (Harvard).\n\nTo solve this problem, we are set out to inspire the human race to rise above their pain, and create new healthier habits so they can share their love and gifts with others.
