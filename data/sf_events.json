The two are now divorced. Her father is of Native American and Irish ancestry and her mother is of Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban ancestry.\nDawson grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side and has a brother named Clay. She and her family squatted in an abandoned building during most of her childhood. While attending school, she had aspirations of becoming a marine biologist.\nDawson's acting career began when filmmaker Larry Clark saw her on a Manhattan stoop and asked her to be in a film he was making. The movie, Kids, became a critical success and Dawson's performance was commended, and as a result she decided to pursue career in acting; attending the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. Dawson has worked steadily since her debut, with a mixed amount of commercial and critical success. As of 2006, she has worked with such notable directors as Oliver Stone, Robert Rodriguez, Kevin Smith and Spike Lee, and costarred with the likes of Will Smith, Edward Norton, Taye Diggs, and Colin Farrell.\nDawson's films have varied; ranging from independent films, to highly successful big budget blockbusters, and large scale box office bombs. Among her successes are the Spike Lee-directed He Got Game, opposite professional basketball player Ray Allen, and Men in Black II, which saw her sharing the screen with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, and among her failures are the long-shelved The Adventures of Pluto Nash (which was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards) and the live-action film adaptation of Josie and the Pussycats, though the latter did go on to find a cult audience once it was released on home video.\nIn 1999, Dawson teamed up with Prince for the timely re-release of his 1980s hit \"1999\". The new remixed version featured the actress in an introductory voice over, offering commentary on the state of the world in the titular year. The same year she could be seen in The Chemical Brothers video for the song \"Out of Control\" from the album Surrender. She is also featured on the track \"She Lives In My Lap\" from the second disc of the OutKast album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, during which she speaks the intro and a brief interlude towards the end.\nIn 2005, Dawson appeared on stage as Julia in the Public Theatre revival of Galt MacDermot's 1971 musical The Two Gentlemen of Verona at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, New York (August-September 2005). Her films for that year included the adaptation of the popular musical Rent, where she played Mimi Marquez, and the adaptation of the graphic novel Sin City, where she played the prostitute-dominatrix, Gail. She will appear in Sin City's sequel in 2008.\nIn 2006's Clerks II, Dawson starred as Becky, the crush-turned-wife of Dante. As she mentioned in the making of documentary, Back to the Well, the donkey show sequence was what made her decide to appear in the movie. In May of the same year, Dawson, an avid comic book fan, co-created the comic book miniseries Occult Crimes Taskforce.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.altisimolive.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gente de Zona ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8160612.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-05", "Genre": "Reggae, Hip Hop, Hip-hop, Urban, Latin, Reggaeton", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "GENTE DE ZONA, Convertidos en los primeros artistas cubanos en llegar al tope del Billboard's \"Hot Latin Songs\", ellos son los l\u00edderes de una revoluci\u00f3n musical.

The Live and Re-Wrapped Summer/Fall 2004 Tour, her first tour in eight years was produced by Clear Channel Entertainment. The tour featured Estefan\u2019s greatest hits, along with new material from Unwrapped.\nIn December 2006, Estefan appeared as a special guest singer on the UK\u2019s talent show The X Factor (TV series).As one of the biggest new stars to emerge during the mid-'80s, singer Gloria Estefan predated the coming Latin pop explosion by a decade, scoring a series of propulsive dance hits rooted in the rhythms of her native Cuba before shifting her focus to softer, more ballad-oriented fare. Born Gloria Fajardo in Havana on September 1, 1957, she was raised primarily in Miami, FL, after her father, a bodyguard in the employ of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, was forced to flee the island following the 1959 coup helmed by Fidel Castro. In the fall of 1975, Fajardo and her cousin Merci Murciano auditioned for the Miami Latin Boys, a local wedding band headed by keyboardist Emilio Estefan. With their addition, the group was rechristened Miami Sound Machine and four years later, Fajardo and Estefan were wed. As Miami Sound Machine began composing their own original material, their fusion of pop, disco, and salsa earned a devoted local following, and in 1979 the group issued their first Spanish-language LP on CBS International. Despite a growing Hispanic fan base, they did not cross over to non-Latin audiences until \"Dr. Beat\" topped European dance charts in 1984.\n\nWith 1985's Primitive Love, Miami Sound Machine recorded their first English-language effort, scoring three Top Ten pop hits in the U.S. alone with the infectious \"Conga,\" \"Bad Boy,\" and \"Words Get in the Way.\" For 1988's triple-platinum Let It Loose, the group was billed as Gloria Estefan & Miami Sound Machine, reeling off four Top Ten hits -- \"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,\" \"Can't Stay Away from You,\" the chart-topping \"Anything for You,\" and \"1-2-3.\" 1989's Cuts Both Ways was credited to Estefan alone and generated her second number one hit, \"Don't Wanna Lose You\"; however, while touring in support of the album, on March 20, 1990, her bus was struck by a tractor trailer. She suffered a broken vertebrae that required extensive surgery and kept her off the road for over a year. Emilio Estefan and the couple's son were injured in the crash as well, but all three recovered. Estefan resurfaced in 1991 with Into the Light, again topping the charts with \"Coming Out of the Dark,\" a single inspired by her near-fatal accident; two more cuts from the album, \"Can't Forget You\" and \"Live for Loving You,\" secured her foothold on the adult contemporary charts.\n\nWith 1993's Mi Tierra, Estefan returned to her roots, recording her first Spanish-language record in close to a decade and earning a Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album; on the follow-up, 1994's covers collection Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me, she also recalled her dance-pop origins with a rendition of the Vicki Sue Robinson disco classic \"Turn the Beat Around.\" Another all-Spanish effort, Abriendo Puertas, earned the Grammy as well, while Destiny featured \"Reach,\" named the official theme of the 1996 Summer Olympics. As Latin pop made new commercial headway thanks to the efforts of acts like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, Estefan reigned as the most successful crossover artist in Latin music history, with international record sales close to the 50 million mark. In 1999, she also made her feature film debut alongside Meryl Streep in Music of the Heart, recording the film's title song as a duet with *NSYNC and scoring both a massive pop hit and an Oscar nomination in the process. A new Spanish-language album, Alma Caribe\u00f1a, followed in the spring of 2000.

Lo anterior puede comprobarse al constatar la gran cantidad de causas filantr\u00f3picas a las que apoya continuamente. As\u00ed, el trabajo de su propia fundaci\u00f3n Mi Sangre ha sido reconocido a nivel internacional como uno de los m\u00e1s activos en contra de la utilizaci\u00f3n de las minas personales, tanto en Colombia como en el resto del mundo.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de dicha labor en pro de la erradicaci\u00f3n de estos mort\u00edferos dispositivos b\u00e9licos, la Fundaci\u00f3n Mi Sangre proporciona asistencia y rehabilitaci\u00f3n a las personas lesionadas por minas terrestres en todo Colombia. La cruzada de Juanes en favor de estas v\u00edctimas lo llev\u00f3 a ser el primer artista en dar un concierto en la sala principal del parlamento de la Uni\u00f3n Europea, evento que trajo consigo una donaci\u00f3n de dos y medio millones de Euros.\n\nAsimismo, organiz\u00f3 el muy exitoso recital ben\u00e9fico Colombia sin minas en Los \u00c1ngeles, recolect\u00f3 fondos para la creaci\u00f3n del Parque de la Paz en Medell\u00edn, con juegos especialmente adaptados para los individuos con capacidades diferentes, y fungi\u00f3 como orador de honor durante la Cumbre de Cartagena para un mundo libre de minas. Al expandir de esta manera su misi\u00f3n, la Fundaci\u00f3n Mi Sangre trabaja actualmente en el \u00e1rea del desarrollo de la ni\u00f1ez temprana a trav\u00e9s de toda Am\u00e9rica Latina.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de todos estos esfuerzos espec\u00edficos realizados mediante esta organizaci\u00f3n, Juanes se ha ganado el reconocimiento internacional por su papel como cofundador y principal promotor de los hist\u00f3ricos conciertos Paz sin Fronteras, mismos que buscan unir a los ciudadanos comunes sin distingo de nacionalidades o ideolog\u00edas e impulsar la utilizaci\u00f3n de las resoluciones no violentas para dirimir conflictos.\n\nOrganizado en tan s\u00f3lo una semana en 2008 como respuesta a las crecientes tensiones entre Colombia y Venezuela, el primer concierto Paz sin Fronteras uni\u00f3 a m\u00e1s de 200 mil espectadores (as\u00ed como a millones de televidentes) que se dieron cita en la frontera entre ambas naciones para demandar un esfuerzo por mantener la paz en la regi\u00f3n.\n\nEl segundo de estos conciertos se llev\u00f3 a cabo en La Habana el 20 de septiembre de 2009, para hacerlo coincidir con el D\u00eda Internacional de la Paz de las Naciones Unidas. All\u00ed, un mill\u00f3n 200 mil j\u00f3venes atiborraron la Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n en una impresionante manifestaci\u00f3n de unidad y de esperanza en formar \u201cuna sola familia cubana\u201d. El evento recibi\u00f3 una extensa cobertura medi\u00e1tica alrededor del mundo, y la cadena CNN lo calific\u00f3 como \u201cun enorme \u00e9xito\u2026 en el que Juanes se gan\u00f3 el cari\u00f1o de todo el pueblo cubano\u201d; por su parte, The Economist declar\u00f3 ese d\u00eda como un \u201cparteaguas en la relaci\u00f3n entre Estados Unidos y Cuba\u201d.\n\nEn reconocimiento a tan destacada labor filantr\u00f3pica, el presidente colombiano nombr\u00f3 a Juanes \u201cel Embajador m\u00e1s importante de Colombia\u201d. El compositor tambi\u00e9n fue distinguido en 2005 por Sir Paul McCartney durante el concierto de gala Adopt-a-Minefield, y poco despu\u00e9s se le design\u00f3 Caballero de la Orden de las Artes y las Letras de la Rep\u00fablica Francesa. Asimismo, la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos lo nombr\u00f3 en 2008 como el personaje humanitario del a\u00f1o, y en fecha reciente se le otorg\u00f3 en Colombia el prestigioso Premio Nacional de la Paz, en un voto conjunto del Programa para el Desarrollo de la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNDP) y representantes de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n colombianos.\n\nFinalmente, Juanes se ha presentado dos veces en vivo como parte del Concierto de Entrega de los Premios Nobel de la Paz en Oslo, y en 2009 encabez\u00f3 junto con Alicia Keys el programa art\u00edstico de la Clinton Global Initiative en Nueva York.\n\nObviamente, todos estos mensajes de altruismo no ser\u00edan efectivos si el mensajero no tuviese un gran arrastre popular. A este respecto, no es arriesgado afirmar que Juanes es una de las figuras m\u00e1s importantes del rock latino, tanto por el n\u00famero de \u00e1lbumes vendidos como por la enorme cantidad de conciertos con localidades agotadas que ofrece. En su carrera ha celebrado mas 800 conciertos en America, Europa y Asia.\n\nHasta la fecha, los fans de Juanes han adquirido m\u00e1s de 12 millones de sus discos a nivel mundial, a lo largo de una carrera que abarca s\u00f3lo cuatro entregas. Ha obtenido nada m\u00e1s y nada menos que diecisiete premios LATIN GRAMMY, todo un r\u00e9cord, siempre encabezando la categor\u00eda en la que participa. En 2008, Juanes volvi\u00f3 a arrasar en la entrega de estos galardones \u2014con cinco de cinco\u2014, incluyendo los reconocimientos a mejor \u00e1lbum y canci\u00f3n del a\u00f1o. De igual manera, en 2009 gan\u00f3 el premio GRAMMY al mejor \u00e1lbum pop latino.\n\nJuanes ha ganado adem\u00e1s 18 Premios MTV y 16 Premios Lo Nuestro entre otros reconocimientos internacionales.\n\nAdicionalmente, Juanes se encuentra de manera frecuente en los primeros lugares de las listas de popularidad de los Estados Unidos, Europa y toda Latinoam\u00e9rica. Su disco m\u00e1s reciente, titulado La vida\u2026 es un ratico fue el \u00e1lbum latino m\u00e1s vendido en iTunes durante todo 2008, y \u201cMe enamora\u201d, su primer sencillo, se mantuvo por cinco meses (20 semanas) como el #1 de la lista \u201cHot Latin Songs\u201d de Billboard. Esto represent\u00f3 la permanencia m\u00e1s larga en el primer lugar de cualquier canci\u00f3n latina durante los \u00faltimos tres a\u00f1os. En todas sus grabaciones Juanes toca la guitarra.\n\nLa canci\u00f3n \u201cCamisa Negra\u201d del \u00e1lbum MI Sangre, fue #1 en mas de 43 pa\u00edses\nJuanes ha grabado duetos con Nelly Furtado, Black Eye Peas, Tonny Bennet, Miguel Bos\u00e9, Raphael y Colbie Caillat.\n\nRecientemente grab\u00f3 con la leyenda del Jazz, Herbbie Hancock una nueva versi\u00f3n de \u201cLa Tierra\u201d canci\u00f3n escrita por Juanes en 1996 y considerada por muchos el segundo himno nacional de Colombia.\n\nEn el 2010 Juanes recibi\u00f3 el premio NAFTRA a la Excelencia Categor\u00eda Grabaci\u00f3n Musical y el Premio Presidente BMI por su larga trayectoria de \u00e9xitos como compositor.\n\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 del s\u00f3lido respaldo de sus seguidores, las estaciones radiof\u00f3nicas y sus compa\u00f1eros de profesi\u00f3n, la m\u00fasica de Juanes ha recibido grandes elogios de la cr\u00edtica especializada:\n\n\n\u201c\u2026canciones inolvidables en discos que retan, inspiran y cautivan\u2026\nuno de los artistas m\u00e1s influyentes de la d\u00e9cada\u2026 capaz de vender millones al tiempo que compone m\u00fasica inteligente, que invita a la reflexi\u00f3n\u201d-NPR\n\n\u201cEl cantante y compositor m\u00e1s candente de Am\u00e9rica Latina\u2026\nun poeta con guitarra el\u00e9ctrica\u201d - New York Times\n\n\u201cUn h\u00e9roe cultural con gran imaginaci\u00f3n musical y un don para las letras po\u00e9ticas: un John Lennon latino\u201d \u2013 Amazon\n\n\u201cEl m\u00e1s grande e importante artista latinoamericano\nen este inicio del siglo XXI\u201d \u2013 All Music", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.altisimolive.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "J Balvin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10274965.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-05", "Genre": "Latin Urban, Reggaeton, Latin", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.altisimolive.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kate Del Castillo ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-05", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.altisimolive.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adriana ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7252831.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-05", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.altisimolive.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Steve Aoki ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6048342.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-05", "Genre": "Electronic, Indie, Electro, Alternative", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aoki, whose father Rocky is the founder of the famous Benihana Japanese restaurant chain, and sister Devon is a famous model and actress, is one of Los Angeles' most well known DJs.\nHe founded his own record label, Dim Mak Records (which has signed such artists as Bloc Party, Whirlwind Heat, Whitey and Neon Blonde), in 1996 and has also launched a Dim Mak clothing line.

Since 1997, his distinct blend of traditional salsa with progressive influences such as pop, rock, gospel, R&B, hip-hop, and reggaet\u00f3n has garnered numerous plaudits. Negr\u00f3n has earned many Grammy nominations, Billboard Award nods, and two Premio Lo Nuestro Awards for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d. He\u2019s also had several number one singles, four gold and platinum albums, and nine Billboard Top 40 Hot Latin Tracks. His last album, his ninth overall, 2009\u2019s Independence Day (Airgo Music), earned enthusiastic reviews from New York Times\u2019 Jon Pareles who highlighted it in his seasonal record release roundup. Negr\u00f3n was also selected to perform the album\u2019s Spanglish hit, \u201cHolding On to Love\u201d, on an episode of ABC\u2019s One Life To Live, where he also appeared with a speaking role.\n\nDespite the many commitments of his professional life, Frankie Negr\u00f3n always makes time for something very personal: giving back to the Latino community through his passion for health issues.\n\nNegr\u00f3n is an active supporter of the American Diabetes Association and the American Red Cross. \u201cJuvenile diabetes is an important issue in my family, and in the Latino community. Blood donation is important to educate people about because a majority of Latinos have O positive blood type, making us universal donors,\u201d Negr\u00f3n explains. Frankie attends events, screenings, makes public service announcements, and puts on special performances to benefit both organizations. \u201cWanting to give back is vital to me. I am blessed to have career where I share my voice, but that voice extends beyond my music. I get to be a voice for my community,\u201d he says. \u201cMy family has been directly affected by juvenile diabetes and by not having organ matches when needed. Getting treated or screened for diabetes can save your life, and a pint of blood can save someone else\u2019s life. Our time on this earth will be measured not by what we accumulated, but by what we shared. I need to share this message.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey-born and raised salsa singer of Puerto Rican descent recently began a creatively fruitful relationship with Airgo Music. The album delivered the epic single \u201cAdicto A Tu Piel\u201d, a fan favorite and an industry smash, reaching #3 on the Billboard Tropical charts alongside pop superstars and garnering a staggering amount of radio spins. Negr\u00f3n debuted his first English single, \u201cTorn\u201d, on Good Day New York where the show highlighted the album\u2019s innovative packaging which included a Frankie Negr\u00f3n-branded USB drive. The album was Frankie\u2019s first independent release, and the label negotiated groundbreaking direct distribution deals for it with Walmart and Best Buy. Recently Negr\u00f3n recorded and released the sizzling salsa single \u201cQuemare Mi Cama\u201d. The single is sure to whet fans\u2019 appetites for an upcoming Frankie Negr\u00f3n salsa production due fall, 2012.\n\n\u201cThe new album\u2019s concept is taking shape nicely. It will be my Spanish-flavored sound but pushing the bounds of what is traditionally considered salsa,\u201d Negr\u00f3n reveals. \u201cKaren Rodriguez from American Idol co-wrote a song. There is that tropical flavor, but with different rhythms from samba and bachata music. There will be different instruments introduced, meshing many of the different musical sounds that define me, together in one production.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFor Press Inquiries please contact info@airgomusic.com", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.altisimolive.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alejandro Sanz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8656693.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-05", "Genre": "Latin", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.altisimolive.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lila Downs ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9061324.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-05", "Genre": "guitar, harp, sax, Giovanni Buzurro - bass Luis Huerta- drums / Celso Duarte, Leo Soqui - accordion, accordion / Josh Deutsch - trumpet / Sinuhe Padilla Isunza - jarana, drums / Nikki Campbell and Marcos Lopez - percussion / Rafael Gomez - guitar / George Saenz - trombone, guitar / US - Europe Band: Yayo Serka, zapateado / Luis Guzman - bass, Lila Downs - vocals, violin, Paul Cohen - keyboard, clarinet / Mexico band: Angelito Chacon - guitar / Patricia Pi\u00f1\u00f3n - percussion", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Lila Downs is one of the most most influential artists in Latin America.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "Battle For The Room\n\nA Cinco de Mayo Backyard Party\npowered by PLUSH\n\nTuesday May, 5th 2020\n\n3 Rooms | 3 DJs | 3 Genres\n\nHip-Hop Room: DJ So Hype\n\nReggae Room: DJ Mr. G\n\nLatin Room: DJ Regulator\n\nLive Streaming on:\nwww.TGXlive.com\n\n4:00pm (PST) / 7:00pm (EST) / 11:00pm (GMT)\n\n***Minimum $1 Donation gets you a Raffle/Admission with a chance to win a bottle of PLUSH Vodka.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "John Allaire plays music from his albums with a feature album each show.

Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jelly Ellington LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10366099.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Funk, Rock, Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jonathan \u201cJelly\u201d Ellington is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter based in Austin, TX by way of the mountains of Asheville, NC.

He has had the privilege of playing with great performers such as Jonny Lang, Anthony Gomes, Larry McCray, Albert Cummings, Walter Trout, and has opened 2x for Kenny Wayne Shepherd , Tommy Castro and the Painkillers, Bernard Allison, Marcus King, Samantha Fish and Tab Benoit. Jake recorded and released his first album, Piece of My Mind, in the summer of 2017 when he was just 16 years old. Earlier that year he was honored with his first endorsement from Heritage Guitars as a Young Artist. He has since been endorsed by companies such as Lizard Spit, JobeTone pickups, Apex strings, and Medina Made straps. Jake has also won a \u201cJammie award from Western Michigan\u2019s WYCE radio for \u201cListener\u2019s Choice Best Album by a New Artist\u201d and \u201c2018 Emerging Artist of the Year.\u201d All of this and he has maintained a 4.0 GPA taking honors and advanced placement courses, is a member of the National Honors Society (volunteering at least 50 hours a year at charitable events), Symphonic band, and marching band, in which he plays the euphonium at Marshall High School.\nAt the age of 9 Jake began playing the acoustic guitar. Although he wasn\u2019t a big fan of this, at the time, he continued lessons for a few semesters. At the age of 11 he received his first electric guitar, a Fender Starcaster combo kit, as an Easter present and everything changed. He immediately bonded with the electric guitar and rarely put it down. A fire had been ignited deep within his young soul; one that continues to burn stronger every day. The guitar is the first thing that he picks up every morning and the last thing he lies down at night before he sleeps.\nJake began learning 80\u2019s rock immediately after he received the electric guitar. He also had/has an uncanny knack for learning by ear. He quickly found that the music played by Eddie Van Halen and Angus Young were at the top of his growing \u201chero\u201d list. Within a few weeks he was playing the main riffs from almost every tune they had made famous. Jake continued to play rock and roll music for the next couple of years until he was introduced, in 2013, to the music of Stevie Ray Vaughan. This was a real turning point, and Jake quickly found that the blues didn\u2019t require him to play every song note for note. He was able to put his own touch, emotions, and spin on every song, expressing his own feelings. This new found freedom opened the door to a plethora of musicians, sounds, and feelings he could convey via the guitar. Very quickly, Jake had mastered all the songs on Stevie Ray Vaughan CD. By the fall of 2013 Jake was playing like he had been born with a guitar in his hands.\nIn January of 2014, Jake made his public debut in front of approximately 600 people at a blues jam/chili cook off for a charitable event at a local church. He was able to join a bassist and drummer and played a rousing version of \u201cEmpty Arms.\u201d This was also his first time singing in public. It was an emotional event and Jake was given his first standing ovation. This event is responsible for Jake\u2019s continued love of performing his music. It was the inspiration Jake needed to develop a band of his own.\nPerhaps the most pivotal moment, thus far, came in the fall of 2015 when Jake found himself on the same stage at the State Theater in Kalamazoo, MI playing with an International star named Jonny Lang. During a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d with Jonny before the concert, Jake was surprised with an invitation, from Jonny, to perform a song with him on stage that night. This event, because of Jonny\u2019s kindness, has continued to be a HUGE inspiration and is the reason Jake plays his own version of Jonny Lang\u2019s \u201cAngel of Mercy\u201d at almost every show. As Jake continues into his senior year of high school, he writing and playing his music at festivals and events all over Michigan. He will soon begin recording his second album with all original songs. Jake Kershaw plays as a high energy power trio and often a quartet, and performs classic blues and blues with a rock edge.\nKershaw Entertainment LLC\n269-358-0723\nkershawentertainment@gmail.com\njakekershaw.com", "otherInfo": "Join Blues-Rock sensation Jake Kershaw in the Basement with tons of music and special guests!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Claire Kelly Music LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8631372.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Cary, Illinois", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Official music page of Claire Kelly.

For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Death Cab for Cutie LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8686107.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Alternative Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Death Cab for Cutie knew immediately that Kintsugi would fit perfectly as the title of their eighth studio album. A philosophy derived from the Japanese art of repairing cracked ceramics with gold to highlight flaws instead of hiding them, kintsugi speaks to the way an object's history is part of its aesthetic value. \"Considering what we were going through internally, and with what a lot of the lyrics are about, it had a great deal of resonance for us \u2014 the idea of figuring out how to repair breaks and make them a thing of beauty,\" says bassist Nick Harmer, who suggested the name to singer-guitarist Ben Gibbard and drummer Jason McGerr. \"Philosophically, spiritually, emotionally, it seems perfect for this group of songs.\"\nLong before they gave the album its name, the band embarked on a process that forced them to do things differently than they ever had before. For instance, in the course of making their seven previous albums, the Seattle band hadn't written much in the studio together. They had always preferred to hone their arrangements separately, or with just two or three of them playing at once. But when it came time to record Kintsugi, Death Cab for Cutie went into the studio with the openest of minds. Their willingness to try anything \u2014 including a twenty-minute exploration that evolved into one of the album's finest tracks, \"The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive\" \u2014 yields Death Cab's most compelling new work in years: an album that packs as much sonic as it does emotional wallop.\nKintsugi is the band's first time recording with a producer other than their own Chris Walla, the guitarist and multi-instrumentalist whose talents behind the board had helped shape Death Cab's sound since Gibbard released the You Can Play These Songs With Chords cassette in 1997. For Kintsugi, they worked with Rich Costey (whose production credits include albums by Franz Ferdinand, Muse, and Interpol), recording at his Los Angeles studio Eldorado over the course of twelve weeks in the first half of 2014. \"He was all in in a way that I don't think a lot of producers are nowadays,\" says Gibbard. \"We couldn't have landed on a better collaborator for this record. He accomplished what we've always attempted, which is to make Death Cab sound on a record how we sound live. And we're a rock band live. The difficulty now for the live show is making them rock as hard as they rock on the record. That's a new quagmire for this band.\"\nWork on Kintsugi began back in early 2013, as all Death Cab LPs have, with Gibbard writing and demoing the songs on his own before arranging and recording them with his band mates. They initially convened in fall of 2013 at Walla's Hall Of Justice studio in Seattle. Ten days into recording, Chris decided to step down as producer. Says Gibbard. \"Nothing dramatic, he just said, 'I don't think I'm the right guy to do this album and we should find someone else.'\" The band all felt that they needed to shake things up a bit. \"We challenged each other more and left no stone unturned. That was as gratifying as it was frustrating at times, but I couldn't be happier with the end product,\" says McGerr. Walla has since decided to leave the band but participated in the recording process as fully and vitally as he had on their previous albums. In fact, Costey didn't even know Walla was leaving the band until after Kintsugi was finished. Chris played his final show with the band in September at Rifflandia Festival in British Columbia.\nWhen they started recording, there weren't any rules at all. They'd work on a song for a while and then regroup with Costey to figure out elements to expand or elaborate. \"These guys have a chemistry that's existed for a long time, and that chemistry can't be ignored,\" says Costey. \"When you have a band that can play as well as they can play with each other, having them jam together in real time can actually be the quickest way to try a bunch of ideas and get them on tape.\" Songs such as the instantly memorable \"Good Help (Is So Hard To Find),\" the warm and vulnerable \"Little Wanderer\" and the brooding lead single \"Black Sun\" were all tracked with the four members of the band playing together in a room, reacting to each other in real time, adding layers \u2014 and later subtracting some. \"All four of us being on the floor together in the studio was something that hadn't happened in years, because Chris was always behind the glass or in the control room,\" says McGerr. \"But this was more like when we're onstage, where everyone has their eyes closed and we're playing in the moment. With 'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive,' it turned into a twenty-minute thing they captured in the control room on a two-track. We had started it in Seattle months prior and it just wasn't getting there. Rich brought us into the control room and was like, 'This is our song.'\"\nCostey credits another element of their production set-up with helping achieve the perfect balance of their classic approach and the new one: \"My studio has one big live recording space and two control rooms,\" he says. \"Once we got basic tracks together, Chris would work on them in the other control room. And he would end up doing completely different versions of the songs. For 'Black Sun,' Chris did all this super old school sequenced synth stuff that we used on the final track, and it really brought that song to another level.\"\n\"Black Sun\" is also a perfect example of Gibbard's customarily honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. \"'Black Sun' is about divorce and the ugliness and conflicting emotions that come with that: anger, sadness, finger-pointing, acceptance, forgiveness, understanding. To me, the idea of a black sun has multiple meanings: The black sun could be an eclipse, where one thing eclipses another. The sun is supposed to be a radiating light on the world but in this instance it is blacked out. We've all been that at some point in our life when we're supposed to be shining upon someone giving them support, but for some reason are unable to do that. I am the black sun, and the song is as much an indictment of myself as anything.\"\nAlthough, in the case of \"Black Sun,\" Gibbard says he's willing to elaborate on the elements of the song that are autobiographical, he's never been one to reveal the precise meaning behind his lyrics. \"I know that people will assume these songs are about certain things, and in some instances they are going to be correct,\" he says. \"But I'm not going to give people a road map.\"\nGibbard acknowledges that, early on in the process of writing this group of songs, as he was still trying to make sense of the major changes happening in his life, he had to remind himself not to change his creative process. \"If there's a reason people can relate to my songwriting, maybe it's they feel like they're getting an honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. I'm certainly not going to censor that just because people think they know something about my personal life. I would be cowardly as a songwriter and not be true to what I've always done if I shy away from these events in my life because I was in relationship with a public figure.\n\"I know the lyrics aren't 100% fiction and they're not 100% nonfiction, and only Ben knows what that blend is,\" says Harmer. \"But with this group of songs, I do think he is writing from a genuinely vulnerable and honest place and I'm proud of him for putting himself out there and being fearless about it.\"\nOne of the songs on Kintsugi that Gibbard says he holds closest to his heart is \"Little Wanderer,\" where he sings, \"You sent a photo out of your window of Paris of what you wished that I could see. But someone's gotta be the lighthouse and that someone's gotta be me.\" He explains: \"There are innumerable songs about, like, 'The road ain't no place to start a family.' 'Home Sweet Home' by Motley Crue, 'Gone Til November,' by Wyclef Jean, and so on. But nobody ever writes a song about sitting at home, waiting for someone to come back. And for so much of my life, I've been the one off somewhere in the world trying to maintain a connection through digital portals. Now, being with someone who travels pretty much all the time, I feel like I've gotten a taste of my own medicine. All the songs are personal, but that one is personal in a way that is very tender to me.\"\nHere, too, \"The Ghosts of Beverly Drive\" encapsulates important elements of the album's larger theme \u2014 embracing flaws and being open to change. \"If only you had known me before the accident,\" it begins, \"for with that grand collision came a grave consequence.\" Says Gibbard: \"There's this charade you play with someone when you start seeing each other, that no one has ever made you feel this way before,\" says Gibbard. \"'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive' is about when you say to the person you're with, 'Let's just acknowledge that we are not the first people to feel this way. Let's be honest with each other that we've been in love before or that we've fallen out of love with people before, and that's OK.'\"", "otherInfo": "This man needs no introduction.

His devotion to music and his desire to master every aspect of the bass has taken him on an eventful journey: he's received five DownBeat awards, two Jazz Education Network awards, and a nomination from the Central PA Music Hall of Fame. He's also performed coast to coast, appeared at many notable music festivals, performed alongside several of his musical idols, recorded his award-winning original music with prominent jazz artists, and has had his music spun on radio around the world - all before his 15th Birthday.\n\nA love of Brazilian bossa nova and samba inspired Gabriel to write the tune, \"Song for Fina\", which he dedicated to a close family friend for her birthday. \"Song for Fina\" evolved into a DownBeat award-winning composition, and Gabriel made his recording debut with the single in late 2018. In early 2019 he released his follow-up tune, \"Kick Start\". He dedicated it to his Kickstarter backers, and it earned him another DownBeat award for composition. On both recordings, he teamed up with multiple Emmy Award winner and multiple GRAMMY Award nominee Chieli Minucci, who produced and played guitar. Also featured on the project are Special EFX members and world-class musicians Joel Rosenblatt on drums and Jay Rowe on keys. \"Song for Fina\" has been selected by the Jazz Education Network to be performed by the U.S. Navy Commodores at the 2020 JEN conference in New Orleans.\n\nJazz and fusion filled Gabriel's ears as a baby, and as a toddler he'd call out \u201cthe bass! the bass!\u201d in the car, at concerts, and at festivals. He was hooked the moment he was shown a Jaco Pastorius video at age 2. His first experience learning to groove was at 7, when he joined a young Motown tribute band just a few months after starting lessons. That band gained significant recognition in his area, performing at community events, benefits, music festivals, and on radio and TV. While learning the Motown classics, he would challenge himself by transcribing jazz and fusion bass solos. A video of Gabriel at 11 playing Jaco's demanding bass solo in the Weather Report tune, \u201cHavona\u201d, followed by multiple videos showcasing his diverse skills and musicianship, garnered international attention. His professional career was set into motion. He became the first Markbass Rising Star, joined the Ernie Ball Music Man family of artists, and developed a custom line of bass strings made by Carlos Pavicich in France. He is also an endorsing artist for the Paul Lairat fretless Stega bass, Singular Sound, Advanced Audio, Soundbrenner, and ErgoStraps.\n\nAlthough Gabriel played in a variety of bands after the Motown group disbanded, just after his 12th birthday he formed the jazz fusion trio, Teen Town. In just two years since their debut performance, the trio has won a 2019 DownBeat Award, earned a nomination for Best Jazz Band by the Central PA Music Hall of Fame, has toured throughout Pennsylvania, and has opened for a number of major artists, including Sheila E., the Victor Wooten Trio, the Tierney Sutton Band, and the Original Drifters. They've also appeared at many notable festivals and events, including the 2018 and 2019 Boscov's Berks Jazz Festival, the 2017 and 2018 Dauphin County Wine & Jazz Festival, the Scranton Jazz Festival, and TEDx Harrisburg. Everywhere they play, they take their audiences by storm.\n\nAs a soloist, Gabriel has been a guest with many ensembles in the past 8 years. Recent appearances include being a guest performer and panelist at the 2019 Jazz Philadelphia Summit, performing in the 2019 COTA Jazz Festival, appearing with Doug Wimbish (of Living Colour) at the 2019 Philadelphia WimBash, as a guest artist at the 2019 Detroit BASSDAY, and as a guest performer at the 2019 Elkhart Jazz Festival. He's also performed in the 2018 and 2019 NAMM Shows in LA, the 2018 Dallas International Guitar Festival, and the 2018 Berkshires Jazz Festival. Gabriel's list of teachers and mentors include several of his bass icons, such as Victor Wooten, Anthony Wellington and Adam Nitti. He\u2019s had the honor of receiving scholarships to Wooten\u2019s Bass/Nature Camp, the Berklee College of Music\u2019s Groove School, and the Central PA Jazz Camp.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Taylor was raised in Austin, and his parents loved music. So it only followed that young Will spent many nights at the Armadillo, listening to music, in the company of his parents. The Armadillo was all about inclusiveness, for it was the home of rock and country, ballet and jazz, folk, blues and the spoken word. There were no boundaries. Form didn't matter as much as passion. As a boy, Taylor wandered about in this landscape without thinking about it. As he came of age in the late 1980s, Taylor gravitated toward jazz and classical music -- a world void of lyrics -- even though his parents had always been aficionados of singer-songwriters such as Townes Van Zandt. He mastered the viola, toured with the Turtle Island String Quartet and eventually put together a string jazz ensemble in Austin.

The stakes are different.\"\n\nThose stakes are what lie at the heart of David Wax Museum's fourth and boldest studio album to date, \"Guesthouse.\" It's the sound of a band reconciling the accountability of marriage and parenthood with the uncertainty and challenges of life on the road; of coming to terms with the limitations of the \"folk\" tag that launched their career and pushing past it into uncharted musical territory; of reimagining their entire approach in the studio to capture the magic and the bliss of their live show. In typical David Wax Museum fashion, the songs on \"Guesthouse\" are simplistic and sophisticated, elegant and plainspoken all at once. Rather than succumbing to the weight of the newfound responsibilities that landed on their doorstep, the band has leaned into the challenges to capture a brilliant portrait of the messy beauty of it all.\n\nThe roots of David Wax Museum stretch back nearly a decade, and all the way from New England to Mexico. As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as \"pure, irresistible joy.\" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding \"like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent\") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music \"global crossover at its best\"). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, and more.\n\nIt was on the road over these past few years as the band and audiences grew, though, that Wax could feel their exuberant live show evolving beyond its formative roots.\n\n\"I felt empowered to start the band because of my time in Mexico studying folk music,\" Wax explains. \"In Boston, the term 'Americana' or 'folk' was just this catchall to describe what everyone was doing. It was helpful to use that to talk about our music at first, but we've found that our hearts feel most shaken, and the band fires on all cylinders, when we're putting on a rock show. What we've tried to retain about our folk origins is the warm sound of people playing acoustic instruments together in a room. But, by embracing more of an indie rock approach, we've colored this record with synthesizers, layers of percussion, and adventurous sonic processing. The mental shift of it helped us feel like we could do anything we wanted. There were no rules that we had to follow in terms of what was 'authentic.'\"\n\nPart of the inspiration for the shift was the presence of guitarist and producer Josh Kaufman, who sat in with the band on tour and added new sounds and textures that the they'd never experimented with before. When it came time to record \"Guesthouse,\" the band knew he had to helm it in the studio.\n\n\"The songs entered this Technicolor, 3D world with Josh,\" explains Wax. \"Aside from his contributions to the arrangements, he really wanted us all to be in a room playing the music together live so that the groove would be central. We brought in two other drummers, and there was a real focus on having as much percussion happening at the same time as possible. We gravitate towards that naturally because of the Mexican influences, all of the syncopations and 6/8 dance rhythms and the energy that that gives us, but we really embraced it this time around.\"\n\nThat emphasis on groove sucks you in from the opening seconds of the kickoff track, \"Every Time Katie,\" a whispered come-on that roils and pulses like an anxious heartbeat and features gorgeous call and response vocals from David and Suz. It's followed by \"Dark Night Of The Heart,\" which pushes the sonic envelope further than any previous David Wax Museum track, blending chamber strings, psychedelic vocal filters, explosive drums, and swirling synthesizers.\n\nWritten partially in Mexico and partially in western Massachusetts, the lyrics on \"Guesthouse\" find Wax writing with more direct, personal honesty than ever before.\n\n\"I had felt really reluctant to talk about personal stuff in the past,\" says Wax. \"I was writing personally, but there were lots of things I was obfuscating or filtering through a character to protect myself from putting too much out there. But it got to a point where it was taking a lot more energy than it was worth to maintain that privacy. When we had our daughter, Calliope, it felt like this sudden release because talking and singing about our lives was becoming more and more integral to what we were doing as artists and who we were as people.\"\n\nThe title track, which draws on several traditional Mexican songs for musical inspiration, is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the life of a traveling musician hunting for a free place to crash, while \"Lose Touch With The World\" faces down the reality of living a life far removed from that of your friends and family, and \"Young Man\" is an earnest musing on growing older.\n\n\"It's about being a parent and coming to terms with what your ambition is,\" explains Wax. \"What part of that is essential to who you are, and what part can you let go of? We have to check in with ourselves and ask what we're doing and why we're doing it more often now because we're not just us putting ourselves through the mental and physical sacrifices of touring anymore,\" he continues. \"Now Calliope is going through it with us, and Suz's dad and my cousin Jordan are going through it with us on the road. And because we're constantly checking and making sure we're doing this for the right reasons, that we feel honest in our hearts about it, I think that's brought new life to what we're doing and a new energy and a new level of commitment.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment brought beautifully to life on \"Everything Changes,\" as Wax and Slezak sing, \"Everything changes / when two becomes three.\" The song was written in response to all of the good-natured warnings about what having a child would mean for the couple, the freedom and sleep and sanity they might lose out on. Instead, they choose to focus on everything they've gained: a beautiful daughter, a stronger bond with their families and fans than ever before, and without a doubt, the most exciting album of their career.

Characterized by unconventionally catchy songs, intertwining male/female vocals, and timelessly relatable lyricism, the band has been organically increasing its fanbase through over a decade of touring and releasing music.\n\nWalsh and McIlwee recorded Belongs to the Dead in 2006 for Summersteps Record\u2019s Handmade CD-r series. The duo used a cassette deck and some cheap microphones in McIlwee\u2019s garage, drawing heavy influence from The Microphones. (The influence was more than just of a sonic nature; the band is named after a lyric from in a Microphones\u2019 song.) Around this time, the duo was also self-recording a full length called I\u2019m On Your Side, the \u201clost tigers jaw lp.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after that Tigers Jaw linked up with Boston\u2019s Run For Cover Records to re-release the seminal Self-Titled album (originally released on CD by Scranton\u2019s Prison Jazz Records), as well as full lengths Two Worlds (2010) and Charmer (2014), and countless splits and EPs.\n\nFollowing a lineup change in 2013, Tigers Jaw finally began touring full-time. Walsh and longtime member Brianna Collins took some time off in 2016 to write songs for a new album. Spin was released in 2017 via producer Will Yip\u2019s Atlantic Records imprint, Black Cement Records. Tigers Jaw\u2019s first major label release was praised by critics and \u201ccemented\u201d the band as a songwriting force, satiating longtime fans and gripping new listeners.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008. Features tracks with Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Saigon, amongst others.", "otherInfo": "Live on The Roots Youtube"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gabriel Severn LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9146837.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Fusion, Motown, Rock, Soul, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul, Funk Etc, Jazz", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Teenage bassist Gabriel Severn developed a love for the instrument before he could even talk. His devotion to music and his desire to master every aspect of the bass has taken him on an eventful journey: he's received five DownBeat awards, two Jazz Education Network awards, and a nomination from the Central PA Music Hall of Fame. He's also performed coast to coast, appeared at many notable music festivals, performed alongside several of his musical idols, recorded his award-winning original music with prominent jazz artists, and has had his music spun on radio around the world - all before his 15th Birthday.\n\nA love of Brazilian bossa nova and samba inspired Gabriel to write the tune, \"Song for Fina\", which he dedicated to a close family friend for her birthday. \"Song for Fina\" evolved into a DownBeat award-winning composition, and Gabriel made his recording debut with the single in late 2018. In early 2019 he released his follow-up tune, \"Kick Start\". He dedicated it to his Kickstarter backers, and it earned him another DownBeat award for composition. On both recordings, he teamed up with multiple Emmy Award winner and multiple GRAMMY Award nominee Chieli Minucci, who produced and played guitar. Also featured on the project are Special EFX members and world-class musicians Joel Rosenblatt on drums and Jay Rowe on keys. \"Song for Fina\" has been selected by the Jazz Education Network to be performed by the U.S. Navy Commodores at the 2020 JEN conference in New Orleans.\n\nJazz and fusion filled Gabriel's ears as a baby, and as a toddler he'd call out \u201cthe bass! the bass!\u201d in the car, at concerts, and at festivals. He was hooked the moment he was shown a Jaco Pastorius video at age 2. His first experience learning to groove was at 7, when he joined a young Motown tribute band just a few months after starting lessons. That band gained significant recognition in his area, performing at community events, benefits, music festivals, and on radio and TV. While learning the Motown classics, he would challenge himself by transcribing jazz and fusion bass solos. A video of Gabriel at 11 playing Jaco's demanding bass solo in the Weather Report tune, \u201cHavona\u201d, followed by multiple videos showcasing his diverse skills and musicianship, garnered international attention. His professional career was set into motion. He became the first Markbass Rising Star, joined the Ernie Ball Music Man family of artists, and developed a custom line of bass strings made by Carlos Pavicich in France. He is also an endorsing artist for the Paul Lairat fretless Stega bass, Singular Sound, Advanced Audio, Soundbrenner, and ErgoStraps.\n\nAlthough Gabriel played in a variety of bands after the Motown group disbanded, just after his 12th birthday he formed the jazz fusion trio, Teen Town. In just two years since their debut performance, the trio has won a 2019 DownBeat Award, earned a nomination for Best Jazz Band by the Central PA Music Hall of Fame, has toured throughout Pennsylvania, and has opened for a number of major artists, including Sheila E., the Victor Wooten Trio, the Tierney Sutton Band, and the Original Drifters. They've also appeared at many notable festivals and events, including the 2018 and 2019 Boscov's Berks Jazz Festival, the 2017 and 2018 Dauphin County Wine & Jazz Festival, the Scranton Jazz Festival, and TEDx Harrisburg. Everywhere they play, they take their audiences by storm.\n\nAs a soloist, Gabriel has been a guest with many ensembles in the past 8 years. Recent appearances include being a guest performer and panelist at the 2019 Jazz Philadelphia Summit, performing in the 2019 COTA Jazz Festival, appearing with Doug Wimbish (of Living Colour) at the 2019 Philadelphia WimBash, as a guest artist at the 2019 Detroit BASSDAY, and as a guest performer at the 2019 Elkhart Jazz Festival. He's also performed in the 2018 and 2019 NAMM Shows in LA, the 2018 Dallas International Guitar Festival, and the 2018 Berkshires Jazz Festival. Gabriel's list of teachers and mentors include several of his bass icons, such as Victor Wooten, Anthony Wellington and Adam Nitti. He\u2019s had the honor of receiving scholarships to Wooten\u2019s Bass/Nature Camp, the Berklee College of Music\u2019s Groove School, and the Central PA Jazz Camp. He has also attended Gerald Veasley\u2019s Bass Bootcamp, the Keystone Jazz Institute, and the Uptown Music Collective.\n\n\u201cGabriel is a listener. He truly is so much fun to play with because he can turn on a dime!

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends.

The deep pockets and far reaching influence of a major record label were gone. And for the first time in many years, the duo found themselves looking at the real possibility of having to get \u201cday jobs.\u201d\n\nInstead, Clyne and Naffah regrouped - both metaphorically and literally - and started down their own path of independence. In 2019, that trek finds Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers celebrating 20 years of chart topping albums and sold out shows across the nation and around the globe. That\u2019s in addition to the band\u2019s annual four-day music festival in Mexico also celebrating its 20th year, and Roger\u2019s own award-winning, ultra-premium top-shelf tequila called Mexican Moonshine. All with 20 years of independence.\n\nIn 1999, singer/songwriter Clyne and drummer Naffah began assembling what wold become RCPM\u2019s debut album, Honky Tonk Union. In the beginning, it was just a couple of musicians with a story to tell. But the duo didn\u2019t want to wait around for another label to judge their music or tell them to \u201cdumb it down\u201d or dismiss them because \u201cwe just aren\u2019t sure what genre you fit in.\u201d Roger and PH simply wanted to keep delivering the music straight to the fans. Out on their own, the road was daunting and passed through what seemed like every small, dark club across the country. But the music of Honky Tonk Union found the people who understood that great songs weren\u2019t only what was being played on the radio.\n\nWith every tour stop the crowds grew a bit bigger, the buzz a little louder. More importantly, the relentless support of the fans enabled Honky Tonk Union to debut at #1 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart \u2013 something even The Refreshments never obtained. The success had Billboard executives calling Clyne in bewilderment asking, \u201cWho ARE you guys?!\u201d Honky Tonk Union hollered at \u201cthe industry\u201d that a band could make music on its own terms \u2013 and still matter.\n\nFrom the opening riffs of \u201cBeautiful Disaster\u201d with its nod to Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d to the band\u2019s signature song, \u201cGreen & Dumb,\u201d Honky Tonk Union is bound in the tradition of story songs that one can immediately identify with. Rather than a big city recording studio, Clyne & Naffah found inspiration in the high-plains grasslands at the Clyne ranch owned by his grandmother, in Southeastern Arizona.\n\n\u201cGreen & Dumb\u201d was written on the day that one of the Clyne\u2019s top cattle-cuttin\u2019 horses broke his leg and had to be put down. As the tequila was passed around probably too many times, a surly Roger was rebuked from the dinner table to wander around the barnyard looking into the little adobe house through the window, ultimately spurring the story. He nostalgically remembers it as \u201dWrite drunk, edit sober. I followed half this advice while composing this song, aching and pining. Why am I always looking in? Why is there always a window in the way? Why is it when the moment passes, I know the right thing to say?\u201d\n\nAfter Honky Tonk Union, the band\u2019s success only grew.\n\nTheir second album, Sonoran Hope and Madness, debuted at #3 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Charts. Their third album, \u00a1Americano!, found RCPM again reaching #1 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart. In fact, since the release of Honky Tonk Union, Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers are the only act to release eight consecutive studio albums landing on the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart. And all on a 100% independent label, EmmaJava Records.\n\nDubbed the \u201cSpringsteen of the Southwest\u201d by the Asbury Park Press, Clyne and his guitar have toured around the world, his career now nearly reaching a quarter-century, starting with The Refreshments. The seminal Tempe, Arizona band made big waves in the \u201990s with the songs \u201cBanditos\u201d (and its infamous chorus, \u201cEverybody knows that the world is full of stupid people\u201d) and \u201cDown Together\u201d as well as writing the theme for TV\u2019s \u201cKing of the Hill.\u201d\n\nToday, Clyne and Naffah, along with bassist Nick Scropos and lead guitarist Jim Dalton, keep the songs of The Refreshments alive, while adding to their own ever growing musical legacy. The band\u2019s annual music festival in Rocky Point, Mexico, called Circus Mexicus, is a testament to their loyal fan base. What began as a rooftop show thrown together with extension cords and wooden pallets 20 years ago has blossomed into a pilgrimage that draws thousands of fans to the once sleepy fishing village. On June 6-9th 2019, Circus Mexicus celebrates 20 years with fellow Americana bands, American Aquarium, Miles Nielsen & The Rusted Hearts as well as self-described psychedelic garage folk artist Drew Hagar (son of Sammy) and a dozen more filling multiple stages in the little beach town of Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, MX.\n\nClyne not only sings about life in the border-lands, he also produces his own private label top shelf tequila called Mexican Moonshine. From gold medals in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition to gold ribbons from Tequila Aficionado\u2019s Brands of Promise, accolades have been rolling in. A bottle of Mexican Moonshine Tequila even made a well received \u201cguest appearance\u201d on the Rachel Ray Show.\n\nAnd it all started with the road to independence 20 years ago.\n\nTo celebrate this milestone, a double record of Honky Tonk Union and its live counterpart, Real to Reel, will be pressed in green and orange vinyl. A digital download companion with previously unreleased material from the Real to Reel live recordings will be included along with some stories and never before seen photos from the early days of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers.\n\nIn the spirit of the band\u2019s support of environmental conservation, this double-album will be packaged in a gatefold jacket using 100% recycled paperboard, and will be released the week of Earth Day.\n\nRoger Clyne & The Peacemakers are still blistering through every corner of the U.S. with hundreds of tour dates annually and incendiary performances that last hours.

In an homage to English author Thomas Hardy\u2019s novel, \u201cJude, The Obscure,\u201d Morris reveals his love for literature, philosophy and poetry \u2014 along with a secret about his stage name.\n\n\u201cThomas Hardy is my given name, and Dude, The Obscure is a moniker I considered using as an artist,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThe hat tip to the novel seemed appropriate for the album because it deals with doubts, joys, regrets and spirituality, a lifelong journey and such.\"\n\nEach song on the album seems compelled by Morris\u2019 desire to help himself\u2014 and others\u2014 conquer the void of everyday meaninglessness. It\u2019s an effort philosopher Maurice Blanchot described as the anguish of writing: \u201cYou have to cross an abyss, and if you do not jump, you do not comprehend.\u201d Morris takes that leap to find universal truth by navigating sometimes opposing perspectives within moments that change lives. Morris beautifully warns us not to succumb to the fear of missing out that stands in the way of contentment on the album\u2019s defining moment, \u201cCheating Life, Living Death.\u201d Every dream is an invitation/ To leave your love up on the shelf/ When you walk out every evening/ Cheating life and living death.\"\n\nFor the sessions, Morris made the familiar pilgrimage to Adam Landry\u2019s home studio in Nashville.

The two were also romantically involved.

On his full-length solo effort Florida, however, his sound is closer to sample-based cinematic instrumental hip hop, not unlike the work of DJ Shadow.\n\nBorn in Mississippi and raised across the southern United States, Diplo picked up much of the local culture while growing up there. Music styles such as dirty south, crunk and miami bass are now trademark ingredients of the Hollertronix output. Pentz's solo work is also influenced by Southern Gothic and other southern literature. Additionally, world music is a strong musical influence on Diplo, especially baile funk which he encountered whilst traveling in Brazil.\n\nDiplo was recently signed to Ninja Tune, on the Big Dada imprint.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label. Two Tomatoes moved into a real office in New York City, with real staff including Shannon Chirone, John Waldman (Great Knight Productions), Corinne Barlow, Katie Messer, Michelle Puskas, Justice Longshore, and publicist Elizabeth Waldman Frazier.\n\nIt's one big happy family!", "otherInfo": "Laurie Berkner is doing daily Facebook lives during the COVID-19 school and community closures.

Based on his instincts, far from today's codes and marketing strategies, he felt the need to let the music speak and sing his heart out from the depth of his soul.

The Nice native decided to start a new journey in february 2018 with new single releases \"My Life\" and \"Im In The Mood\" which have reached 400 000 streams. And this has now lead Medi to the brand new EP \"My Life\" out on June 15th 2018. And it will certainly be followed by a long awaited third album.\n\nRewind. It all kicked off for Medi when in 2006 he released his first album \u201cMedi and The Medicine Show\u201d produced by Dave Stewart and fully recorded in the London studios of the former Eurythmics.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2010, he was guitarist of the queen of electro, \u00c9milie Simon, drummer and arranger for Charlie Winston , with whom he traveled stages around the world following the huge success of their \u201cHobo\u201d album which sold over a million copies around the world.\n\nIn 2011, as a true leader of a \u201csoul\u201d, \u201crock and roll\u201d and \u201cfeel good\u201d spirit, Medi released \u00ab You Got Me (Moving) \u00bb his first solo album which was recorded in Los Angeles by grammy award winner Shawn Everett, produced by Tony Berg and including collaborations with guitarist and producer Blake Mills to name a few. The album flagship single \u00ab How Would You Do It \u00bb was an international success, followed by a tour of more than a hundred concerts including a headline show at Fuji Rock as the single reached number 1 airplay in Japan.\n\nA second album entitled \u00ab One Is Not Enough \u00bb was born in 2014 and it was during that year that the Nice-based artist joined his hometown and became a producer by founding his own label Dime On with which he launched careers of artists such as David Zincke , songwriter from the UK, who's first single \"Oh My\" and debut EP has been critically acclaimed.\n\nMedi is a true entertainer never leaving the stage for too long, a songwriter, a multi-instrumentalist and recently became a music producer for artists such as Ben Mazu\u00e9, Sophie Tith, Joyce Jonathan, or Frero Delavega for which he produced their number one hit single \"Sweet Darling\".\n\nStay tuned, 2018 will be there to write the sequel to an already busy career", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ESKEI83 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10336377.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Bass Music, Trap, Future Bass, Dubstep, Electronic", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "international dj and producer. for bookings please contact: booking@eskei83.com Imprint: www.eskei83.com/imprint", "otherInfo": "7pm CET on every Wednesday from now on!

His father would play everything from Glenn Miller to Alice Cooper, Jerry Jeff Walker to The Doors and ZZ Top while his grandfather\u2019s love of classic Hank Williams and Bob Wills tunes or his grandmother\u2019s voice all worked together to soundtrack Medulla\u2019s early life with color, style, soul and grit.\nWith such a variety of musical influences informing his work, Medulla is an artist rooted in tradition with a sound and style defying simple categorization.\nCutting his teeth in the musically fertile dust of Lubbock, Texas, Medulla began his music career after being urged on stage by friends at an open mic night. In those earliest days of artistic discovery, Medulla stuck to what he knew firsthand, but as is the case with great artists, his music has evolved with the times and as what his real life has looked like from one year to the next.\n\u201cWhen I first started gigging, I was partying hard, trying to cowboy, and living in honky-tonks at least 5 days out of the week.\u201d he says about his beginnings. \u201cIt seems like all of my songs at that time were a direct reflection of a crazy lifestyle I loved. But environments change. The older you get, the more losses you have, the more life you start experiencing, the more love you see. When you grow a family, you start seeing life in a whole new light. It wasn\u2019t until I had kids that I realized I really have no clue about anything.\u201d\nAfter plugging away in Lubbock and eventually landing in Dallas, Medulla found himself sharing the same stage with many of the iconic artists he\u2019d grown up listening to, including Jerry Jeff Walker, Merle Haggard, Leon Russel, Kris Kristofferson, Dwight Yoakam and Robert Earl Keen. Along with making his name known on the stage, Medulla began to grow in the studio as well. His 2004 debut LP, From Heartaches to Hangovers, and the 2009 follow-up, This Time Ago, produced by revered songwriter/producer Walt Wilkins, were filled with his own unique methods and imagination, but it was Medulla\u2019s next album that truly gave him a chance to do what he does best\u2014something different.\n\u201cIt can be a scary thing to be unique, to stand out,\u201d Medulla admits. \u201cSo when you work up the courage to do something different, especially in public, you can\u2019t just do it once. \u201cThe real question is can you stay unique, can you stay truthful with yourself and completely believe that regardless what happens, it\u2019s all worthwhile.\u201d\nMuch of the material from Medulla\u2019s earliest days featured inventive uses of fiddle, mandolin and steel guitar, but Medulla\u2019s 2012 album Speak Easy introduced a new sonic phase to his catalog that was both unpredictable yet sleek and accessible. One of the singles from that record, \u201cStay the Night,\u201d reached the Top 10 on the Texas Regional Radio Chart, as has several of his other singles, including a cover of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m On Fire.\u201d Speak Easy also featured \u201cHow Bad,\u201d a sultry duet with award-winning Americana artist Lindi Ortega.\nIn 2013, Medulla\u2019s music caught the legendary ear of one of music\u2019s all-time great managers and producers, Bill Ham. Responsible for helping Hall of Fame artists ZZ Top and Clint Black find their signature sounds and global audiences, Ham believed in Medulla\u2019s \u201cinnovative sound\u201d enough to work together on not only recording some new songs, but to become a mentor more than a mere industry acquaintance. Ham encouraged Medulla to not only set high professional expectations for himself, but worked with him to exceed those lofty goals. In 2015, before Ham\u2019s sad, sudden passing in 2016, the so-called \u201cFourth member of ZZ Top,\u201d helped produce an industry showcase performance for Medulla, where influencers from across the country had the chance to hear what Ham had been excitedly telling them all about for a couple of years.\nSome of the songs Medulla wrote under Ham\u2019s watchful eye ended up on his 2017 album Suits Me. That record featured another appearance from a country legend via the single \u201cUnbroken Horses,\u201d a song penned by legendary songwriter Dean Dillon (\u201cTennessee Whiskey\u201d). Smoky and atmospheric, the song provided Medulla with his first Number One radio hit. Unlike most of the time when a singer cuts a song from a well-known writer without crossing paths, Medulla and Dillon kept in touch in order for Medulla to gain Dillon\u2019s stamp of approval when the song was recorded.\nJust as was the case with Speak Easy, Suits Me is produced by respected music industry veterans Chuck Allen Floyd and Matt Nolen, and offers surprising instrumental combinations and arrangements, with the sorts of provocative lyrics not found in formulaic song craft. With his sights set on something daring for the video for \u201cWolf Howl\u201d Medulla enlisted the help of television art director Bryan \u201cWally\u201d Walior (Queen of the South). Walior enlisted the aid of an accomplished wardrobe stylist whose worked with pop adventurer Lady Gaga in order to achieve a theatrical, highly stylized set of visuals unlike anything pretty much anything else released that year, especially in Texas.\nWith an exciting, evolving style that has been called \u201cTexas roots in a pinstripe suit,\u201d Jerrod Medulla\u2019s multi-layered, textural music is steeped in tradition, and offered with a modern edge only he can provide in his signature way.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be the best me and honest me that I can,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m a product of everything I\u2019ve lived through. I try to be the truest version of myself that I can be.\u201d", "otherInfo": "95.9 The Ranch is working on keeping live music going.

Platter\u2019s gentle, affecting vocals \u2013 which have earned him numerous comparisons to Willie Nelson \u2013 are carried along freely by the accompaniment of rollicking banjo and harmonica. Fans of the classic \u201870s singer-songwriter genre will delight in Platter\u2019s seamless transitions from toe-tapping jams to sweetly confident ballads throughout the set\u2019s 10 tracks.\nTake Time was recorded and produced by David Mayfield at Tiger Spa in Akron, Ohio. Since most of Platter\u2019s shows are performed as a trio , the album takes care to show off the mellow yet sparkling synergy that arises from a smaller, tight arrangement.\nPlatter, who grew up in Buffalo, NY, had a childhood seeped in rich musical influences \u2013 from Woodie Guthrie to Bob Dylan to Flatt & Scruggs \u2013 but his biggest inspiration to date has been Neil Young. \u201cThe way [Young] lived his life, the way he recorded, not being that mainstream guy--that was a heavy influence on me,\" he explains. \"I've never wanted to be a pop star.\"\nTrue to Young\u2019s experimental and personally driven nature, Platter approaches songcraft without specific genre boundaries, choosing instead to allow his music to evolve instinctually. He made a fast impact on Cleveland's music scene upon moving there from Buffalo in 2008, releasing a debut solo LP in 2013 combining gospel, blues, and rock influences with bittersweet, character-driven lyrics.\nPlatter has been the featured performer at multiple large local music festivals, and is a seasoned roadman, keeping up a steady schedule of regional gigs while continually working on new music. He will be touring in support of Take Time throughout 2018.\nFor more information, please visit www.thorplatter.com\nPublicity: Mike Farley/Michael J.

Unter anderem wie Robert Carl Blank es alleine nur mit seiner Gitarre und Stimme schafft, eine Masse von mehr als 1000 Menschen so zu verzaubern, als w\u00fcrde er f\u00fcr jeden einzelnen singen. Der Konzertbesucher vergisst einen Abend mit dem sympathischen Fallschirmspringer aus Hamburg nur schwer, nachdem seine Songs einmal den Weg in den Geh\u00f6rgang gefunden haben. Robert ist einziges lebendes Roadmovie, der in seinen Liedern seine Erfahrung wiedergibt und das Freiheitsgef\u00fchl mit jeder Pore ausstrahlt. Mr. Blank ist der Prototyp der neuen Generation von Songwritern, die ein aufregendes, spannendes und freies Leben f\u00fchren und ihre Erfahrungen teilen wollen.\n\n\u201eWelcome all you volunteers, jokers, clowns and puppeteers\u201c hei\u00dft es gleich in der ersten Zeile seines neuen Albums \u201eFairground Distractions\u201c, das im Herbst 2016 auf den Markt kam. Robert macht hier ein gro\u00dfes emotionales Fass auf: Ein Album \u00fcber die Liebe zum Leben in seiner ganzen Unvorhersehbarkeit - die gro\u00dfe Freiheit gepaart mit bitter-s\u00fc\u00dfen R\u00fcckblicken. Es ist aber auch ein Album \u00fcber Entscheidungen im Leben geworden. Das Album zeigt wieder einmal, wie gro\u00df das Talent dieses Mannes ist, einfach gute Songs zu schreiben und zu interpretieren. Im Gegensatz zum letzten Album ist der Sound hier 60er Jahre Pop mit vielen Anleihen bei den Gro\u00dfen der Zeit. Den Hamburger mit den tschechischen Wurzeln interessieren keine Schubladen, da ihm das Leben in seiner ganzen Vielfalt daf\u00fcr viel zu schade w\u00e4re. Der inzwischen schon inflation\u00e4r gehandelte Titel des \u201eSinger/Songwriters\u201c ist bei Robert daher auch nur reine Nomenklatur, denn der Pops\u00e4nger und Songschmied ist viel mehr als das. Er ist ein rastloser und leidenschaftlicher Idealist, der sich f\u00fcr ein kompromissloses Musikerleben entschieden hat.\n\nUnber\u00fchrt von den Bequemlichkeiten des b\u00fcrgerlichen Lebens reist er bepackt mit einer Batterie von akustischen Gitarren, einem Fallschirm und einer dicken Portion Soul das ganze Jahr \u00fcber durch die Welt, sammelt Material, beobachtet und schreibt seine Eindr\u00fccke und Erfahrungen als kodierte Reiseberichte nieder. Kaum hat er ein neues Album fertig aufgenommen, gibt es schon Material f\u00fcr das n\u00e4chste. Und dabei sind seine Songs nie am Rei\u00dfbrett entstandene L\u00fcckenf\u00fcller, sondern Reisetageb\u00fccher, inspiriert von intensiven Erfahrungen auf einer selbstgebuchten Welttournee.\n\nSein erster musikalischer Reisebericht nach 10 Jahren Worldwide Travelling - das Deb\u00fctalbum \u201eSoul Circus\u201c 2008 - wurde von der Presse mit Lobeshymnen \u00fcberh\u00e4uft. Das INTRO Magazin lobte beispielsweise das liebevoll aufgenommene Album f\u00fcr seine \u201eRadiotauglichkeit\u201c und ordnete ihn als \u201eHoffnung zwischen Jack Johnson und American Idol\u201c ein. Mit seinem zweiten Album \u201eLast Time I Saw Dave\u201c (2010) konnte er sich nicht nur musikalisch weiterentwickeln, sondern auch sein Deb\u00fctalbum noch toppen. Robert Carl Blank gelang es zweifelsohne zu zeigen, dass er keine Eintagsfliege ist, und g\u00e4be es einen Soundtrack zum Leben, dann h\u00e4tte Robert ihn geschrieben \u2013 eine Wahrheit in und zwischen jedem Song, Ehrlichkeit und k\u00fcnstlerische Tiefe. Arne Schumacher (Radio Bremen) z\u00e4hlt ihn \u201eohne Zweifel zu den talentiertesten englisch textenden Singer/Songwritern in Deutschland\u201c und Heinz Rebellius (u.a.

On the musician\u2019s second solo album, Devour, Hause scours the foundation of that crumbled dream in an attempt to discover how everything we believed growing up could have turned out so differently. The album, initially written to become the third record from Hause\u2019s rock band The Loved Ones, follows his 2011 solo debut Resolutions, a disc that allowed the musician to understand his potential as his own artist.\n\nAs Hause, a Philadelphia native, began penning new music for a new album from The Loved Ones, it became clear that the group, who had taken a break after their second album, had stalled. These songs, however, which showcased a clear thematic journey, were meant to be vocalized by Hause and over the past few years he transformed them into Devour. Hause solidified the album\u2019s sequence before even going into the studio, aiming to craft a narrative arc that drove the album from its dark, heavy first half into a lighter, more hopeful tone. A thematic line of melody runs through the songs, reflecting the overarching ideas in the music itself. The disc explores the heartbreak of shattered childhood promises of a better world and concludes with optimistic hope.\n\n\u201cDevour is about that inherent American appetite,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt\u2019s in all the songs in some degree. There\u2019s a reason why Tony Soprano became such a huge American icon \u2013 he\u2019s this guy with this insane appetite for women and food and power. I think for the American public to latch onto a figure like that says something. Some of the positive things about America come from that as well, but there\u2019s a real sense of reckoning that comes from devouring everything in front of you. Is it ever enough?\u201d\n\nThe rock songs, tinged with folk and punk tones, are firmly rooted in Hause\u2019s own upbringing and the sensibility that comes from growing up in a blue collar neighborhood driven by the lingering anticipation of upward mobility. In the lyrics, the fulcrum around which the album revolves, Hause grapples with this working class ideal and the fact that America\u2019s recent shifts have caused it to no longer fit. From \u201cThe Great Depression,\u201d which centers on the unfulfilled promises laid out in the Reagan-era \u201880s, to the more specific-minded relationships of \u201cFather\u2019s Son,\u201d Devour comes to terms with the loss of youthful innocence in a rapidly evolving world.\n\n\u201cI wanted to shine a light back on what was going on,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt was a topic that was close to me and I wanted to write about it. In the end, it leaves you with the idea that if you have music and love you may be able to save yourself. It\u2019s going to be alright. That simple John Lennon concept of all you need is love. That\u2019s how I wrote myself out of the dark and the music begs the listener to come take that risk as well.\u201d\n\nOnce Hause had the track sequence and overall narrative in place he enlisted producer Andrew Alekel along with musician and co-producer Mitchell Townsend. The producers helped Hause collect the right musicians to build the songs in the best way possible, including My Morning Jacket keyboardist Bo Koster, Social Distortion drummer David Hidalgo Jr. and bassist Bob Thomson. Frightened Rabbit\u2019s Scott Hutchison, Alkaline Trio\u2019s Matt Skiba and The Watson Twins also appear on several tracks. Hause and his crew recorded the album over several weeks from mid-February to mid-March at Grandmaster Recorders LTD. in Hollywood, CA, focusing on giving each song the right tone while maintaining an overall musical aesthetic that helps tie the lyrical themes together.\n\n\u201cIt was this group effort,\u201d Hause says. \u201cA lot of trust went into letting Andrew and Mitch be the architects of the record. I trusted that we would get in there and they would know who was right for the music. They wanted to bring these people together in this great studio to get a record that was greater than the sum of its parts. I\u2019m glad I trusted them because it was great to work with everyone there.\u201d\n\nFor the musician, who has toured with Social Distortion, The Gaslight Anthem, Bouncing Souls and Chuck Ragan since launching his solo career, Devour is a cathartic release, both sonically and lyrically. Hause recently relocated to California and is committed to pursing the music he feels best reflects him individually. The journey on the album, the search for the light at the end of the tunnel, mirrors his own trek. The record closes with the delicate introspection of \u201cBenediction,\u201d a song that pulls lyrical lines from all the tracks that precede it. After all the ruined promises and the culminating disappointments of the world, Hause ends the album with the sentiment of possibility. \u201cIt's love my friend in the end that can save us tonight,\u201d he sings. \u201cSo are you in?\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joy Ike ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9468749.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Pop, World Fusion, Folk, Soul", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Polished and precise, yet buoyed with an airy grace, Joy Ike paints with a broad palette that defies easy categorization.

Written over a four-year period that included a relocation from the comparatively small Pittsburgh to the gritty, thrumming metropolis of Philadelphia, the record is joyously defiant, standing proud and wrapped in blasts of exotic color. It dares us to believe in ourselves, to knock down the walls of fear and doubt we build around ourselves. \u201cThis is an open-armed invitation to dive head first into the unseen\u201d, says Ike. Bigger Than Your Box boldly explores what Ike often refers to as divine discontentment; the restless middle ground between what is and what ought to be. \u201cThe spiritual mystery of life and the ever-present Spirit of God that embraces us in our most helpless state.\u201d\n\nwww.joyike.com", "otherInfo": "Hey Facebook!

A Blues Night in North Carolina, a recording from which Ole Midlife Crisis, a song he wrote and performed with Pura F\u00e9, placed at number 17 on France\u2019s iTunes blues chart in March 2011.\nCrow tribal member and son of an air force officer, Morin was born in\n1962 in Billings, Montana. He spent the bulk of his youth in Great Falls before relocating to Northern, Colorado. There, his musical career started off running with The Atoll, a band he founded in 1989 and that toured nationally, quickly gaining an enthusiastic and devoted following. With The Atoll and The Pura F\u00e9 Trio, and also as a solo artist, Morin has played celebrated venues across the globe, including Paris Jazz Festival, Winter Park Jazz Festival, Folk Alliance International, River People Festival, Shakori Hills Festival and the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Entry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pamela Mary ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9803052.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Christian Country, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "#WorshipWednesday - Pamela Mary LIVE on Fb & IG @ 2:00 PM CST for some favorite old hymns, some CCM songs, & some of my Christian Country originals"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pete Yorn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9402249.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Singer, Songwriter, Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pete Yorn is an American singer, songwriter, and musician.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Josh David ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365744.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Country Blues, Country", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Josh David has performed across North America.

If that's so, then you'd be hard pressed to find a more convincing example of innate talent and desire than Chuck Courtenay. Born in the fabled, swampy, Deep South coastal community of Savannah, Georgia, Chuck witnessed firsthand the mesmerizing spell live musicians can weave on an audience, as he grew up watching his father travel the country as a keyboard-playing frontman, living the hardscrabble life of a touring entertainer. \u201cSome of my very best memories are of the times I spent with my dad over summer vacations,\u201d he now recalls. \u201cI got to go to his gigs, and he'd get me up sometimes to sing Elvis Presley songs. Those were my earliest performances.\u201d Equally formative in young Chuck's musical education were the years spent as a child with his mother and stepfather on a cattle ranch in Central Florida. It was there that the future singer, guitarist and bandleader first became exposed to such Golden Age country and western greats as Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Vern Gosdin and Conway Twitty. These and other timeless artists would ultimately reveal themselves as Chuck's seminal musical influences. Their singles, albums and TV appearances (all of which he soaked up as a child) inform Chuck's own sense of what constitutes a good song, a great vocal and a killer arrangement. However, it was years before he even considered making a living as a musician. In fact, it was only after graduating high school that he even picked up the guitar -- yet, he took to it immediately, and quickly went from learning basic chords to entertaining friends and family to being the featured attraction at nightclubs and restaurants in the greater Savannah area. The day Chuck won the Jimmy Dean True Value Country Showdown, he knew the die was cast: his calling was to be a professional performer. Soon thereafter, he and his brother Jason --a gifted guitarist and singer in his own right-- formed an acoustic duo. Billing themselves as The Courtenay Brothers and boasting impressive \u201cbrother harmonies\u201d and a setlist of well-known cover tunes ranging from classic and modern country and western to '70s soft rock and pop hits, they became an in-demand act in Southeastern Georgia, and could be found gigging several times a week at all manner of venues -- from bars and eateries to outdoor festivals and private engagements. Almost immediately, the duo began racking up local awards. Being named Savannah's Best Country Act in a respected local newspaper poll three years in a row made a real impression on promoters, and that led to high profile opening slots for major modern day country and western stars and icons like Mark Chesnutt, Chely Wright, Blake Shelton, Joe Nichols, Craig Morgan and Lee Greenwood. But all the while, fate was slowly and methodically leading Chuck to a slightly different destination. \u201cBack then, I was juggling my artistic ambitions with a job selling newspaper advertising,\u201d he reflects. \u201cBut in the last five years, I've really made a push to make a name for myself with my music. I realized I had a lot of support and that people were really behind me, digging what I was doing. Now it's full speed ahead.\u201d Since that change of heart, Chuck's certainly put the hammer down on his music career. He quickly formed the popular, hard-rocking, electric group that bears his own name. Made up of veteran players with several decades of combined experience as professional musicians (touring and/or recording with several major country stars), The Chuck Courtenay Band has emerged as one of the tightest and most versatile outfits of its kind, and their lengthy, memorable shows at honky-tonks, country dance clubs, bars and festivals nationwide have cemented their position as one of the most promising acts on today's club circuit. They now play over two dozen shows a month (mostly one-nighters or two-night stands) in an ever-widening radius and travel in their own customized tour bus \u2013 just like the big boys. \"Being on the road so much is very hard and definitely takes a toll,\u201d Chuck admits. \u201cBut I have a very patient wife who really believes in me and what I am doing, so that makes it a little easier.\" The group's high-energy setlist straddles the line between classic country and twangy, roadhouse rock and roll -- an intentional blend that's a source of great pride for Chuck himself, who's no fan of the bland, overproduced pop which is far too often marketed as \u201ccountry music\u201d these days. \"I try and stay away from trendy, lightweight songs I think are gonna be here for a short time,\u201d he says candidly. However, holding fast to such stylistic boundaries can be a difficult task when playing for large crowds accustomed to hearing bar bands offer their own renditions of tunes from the top of that week's charts \u2013 as Chuck himself is quick to acknowledge. \u201cIt's really hard sometimes, because in addition to my own material, we still have to play a lot of covers at some of our smaller shows. Now, if it was up to me, I'd do a whole night of Billy Jo Shaver, Waylon, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson songs. But I want to work, and in these honky-tonks you gotta play some current material. Luckily, if you pick carefully, there's still a lot of good stuff to choose from! \u201cFor example, we do an early Rodney Crowell number called \u201cAin't Living Long Like This,\" and the crowd always loves it. Now, it's just a good ol' hard rockin' song, but we've got a steel guitar and a Telecaster, so we can come pretty darn close to Waylon Jennings' version. Stuff by Gary Allan goes over well, and just about anything from our buddy Billy Currington is always a surefire winner.\u201d Just don't expect Chuck to give up his principles or change his sound too much for the sake of fame. \u201cPeople keep trying to get me to change my sound to be more mainstream, but moving too far in that pop-country direction just doesn't fit me,\u201d he explains with a smile. \u201cListen, I enjoy a great pop song as much as the next guy. But, at the end of the day, I play and sing country music, you know what I mean?\u201d One thing about modern, radio-friendly country he is comfortable with is the top-notch recording quality found on today's major label albums \u2013 and that's something he's finally achieved on his own. Chuck's first CD release was expertly co-produced by his longtime pedal steel man Tommy Butler and tracked in Nashville with some of Music City's finer players. It was an impressive debut all around, and was released to positive reviews on a small, independent, Nashville label. Yet, as strong as that disc was, the difference between that record and GOOD SIDE OF THIS BAR (his brand-new four-song EP) is evident from the first note. Credit that \u201cmillion dollar shine\u201d to Dave McAfee, who for the past 13 years has played drums both on records and stages around the world for Toby Keith, and who co-produced and drummed on Jamey Johnson's massive hit album THAT LONESOME SONG (which was nominated for three Grammys and five American Country Music Awards, and which also contained the Song of The Year \u201cIn Color\u201d). McAfee was introduced to Chuck by established Nashville songwriter Rick Tiger (whose tunes have been recorded by everyone from Del McCoury and Montgomery Gentry to Gene Watson and Joe Nichols). Rick caught Chuck's solo show, felt he'd stumbled upon a major undiscovered talent and alerted McAfee. Dave liked what he saw in Chuck and took him under his wing, both producing and playing drums on GOOD SIDE OF THIS BAR, as well as bringing in a handful of his A-List Nashville musician buddies to help round out the studio band for these sessions. The result is a stunningly well-crafted collection of potential singles that easily rivals most anything you'll hear on Top 40 country radio today. Filled with instantly catchy tunes boasting instantly hummable melodies (such as a delightfully tongue-in-cheek ode to country music legend --and legendary ladies' man-- Conway Twitty, as well as the jangly, danceable love song \u201cFalling\u201d), world-class musical performances and the kind of polished, nuanced production flourishes only found on big-name albums by established stars, the fact that GOOD SIDE OF THIS BAR was made completely independently is somewhat astonishing. Yet it's not altogether surprising. Chuck's vocal prowess and dedication to the old-school values that made country music great the first time around have caught the attention of some of Nashville's best and brightest. The fact that he's come this far without the backing of a large record company --or even a manager-- speaks volumes for the loyal support he earns from his devoted fans. In this day and age, that connection to one's audience counts as much if not more than glitz and glamor -- which is why Music City heavyweights like Dave McAfee are now part of Chuck Courtenay's team. They see in him a sense of respect and reverence for the traditions of country music, and the talent and drive to bring those values of sincerity and substance back to the forefront. Those who have heard Chuck's new material are thrilled with its promise, and all involved hope these first four tracks will generate enough interest to allow the same team to head back in the studio and cut enough additional songs to fill an entire album. In the meantime, Chuck Courtenay will continue to do what he does best \u2013 play live shows whenever and wherever he can, either with his full electric band, or in a solo acoustic setting. \u201cAs of now it works out really well doing both types of gigs,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I'm performing solo it's totally different from my band shows. I can try out new material and play my favorite songs -- many of which I don't do with the band.\u201d He's also focusing increasingly on becoming a better songwriter himself. \u201cI'm writing more and more and want my next album to feature a lot of my own material. Life experiences make the most believable type of songs because they're all yours and they're based in truth! As a rule, I always try to pick and sing songs I know I can deliver sincerely.\" Chuck says the fact that he hails from a very unique and recognizable Southern city has only helped his career, and he's always proud to let folks know he's from Savannah, Georgia. \"Aw, man, they love that I'm from Savannah!\u201d he offers. \u201cThis is a very special town and people really like the charm associated with it. Of course they all ask if I know Paula Deen. (laughs) Which of course I do!

It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Downtown Boys ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7834450.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Dance, Electronic", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Americas booking: alisa@groundcontroltouring.com UK + Europe: matthew.cooper@13artists.com Press: press@subpop.com don't send us fb messages. http://twitter.com/#!/downtownboys http://downtownboys.bandcamp.com", "otherInfo": "Live on Instagram"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stephanie Quayle ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9631287.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Biography\n\nAs a member of CMT's Next Women of Country, Stephanie Quayle is an undeniable force on the country music scene.\n\nThe Rebel Engine Entertainment recording artist is one of the most active female artists with a consistent presence on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, and ranks in the Top 10 of Current Female Airplay over the last two years (Mediabase).\n\nThe singer-songwriter is turning heads as an independent artist with repeat performances on the Grand Ole Opry and historic Ryman Auditorium stages, along with hosting for Wrangler Network on the ACM Awards red carpet, as well as hosting for Sounds Like Nashville on the CMT Awards and CMA Awards red carpets.

His new single \u201cBeautiful Life\u201d is captivating audiences.\n\nWhile many artists spend a lifetime chasing \u201cinternational status,\u201d 24-year-old classically trained singer-songwriter-musician Sebastian Mikael is already starting his career where others can only hope to finish. Born in Sweden to a Swedish father and Ethiopian mother, Sebastian Mikael\u2014formerly known as De-Lor (which is French for \u201cof gold\u201d)\u2014was raised in a diverse household that was enriched by music. While no one in his family ever made music professionally, Sebastian Mikael inherited his passion for music from his father and the sounds he grew up listening to inspired him to find out what was going on behind the music.\n\nWhat started off as a childhood hobby soon snowballed into an adolescent obsession that led to him picking up the guitar and mimicking the sounds he heard on the radio. \u201cI became interested in knowing exactly what the musicians were doing and how they got their sounds,\u201d says Sebastian Mikael, who started off playing his favorite songs by Marvin Gaye, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Wyclef Jean, Akon and Usher.\n\nBefore long, Sebastian Mikael\u2019s newfound passion led him to clocking long hours at Swedish recording studios, singing hooks for rappers and teaming up with a local producer to form a production team. But while the duo\u2019s initial recordings generated a lot of online buzz, Sebastian Mikael was eager to strike out on his own. \u201cI saw the initial potential of the work we were doing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t getting a shot at doing my own songs. Plus, they are not as open-minded about music in Sweden as they are in the U.S.\u201d\n\nFeeling a glass ceiling approaching in Sweden, Sebastian Mikael set his sights on America and enrolled at California\u2019s Musicians Institute to study audio engineering in 2008. After living in California for two years, he relocated to Boston in 2010 to attend Berklee College of Music. While a student at Berklee, Sebastian was signed by Slip-N-Slide Records CEO Ted Lucas and in late 2011 he released his first mixtape, J\u2019Adore, which received rave reviews from his steadily growing fan base. His breakthrough video single, \u201cBeautiful Life,\u201d in which he sings an inspirational message about appreciating life, captures the essence of Sebastian Mikael\u2019s music as a whole. \u201cMy lyrical content is not always about love, but what we go through and feel in life,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to put hope in my music\u2014stuff that makes you feel good musically and lyrically.\u201d\n\nNow in the studio working on his hotly anticipated forthcoming full-length debut album due out in 2013, Sebastian Mikael has been busy collaborating with some of the finest producers and songwriters in the business, including Jim Jonsin and Rico Love.\n\nWith just a handful of years experience as a musician, Sebastian Mikael is already skilled at meshing elements of rock, R&B, pop and electronic music into one cohesive package, held together by his unique acoustic guitar playing. \u201cI feel like my music truly has something to say,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people hear my music, I want them to relate.

With a later start than most musicians, Adam didn't pick up a guitar until the age of eighteen. He soon fell in love with playing and knew music was his calling. He developed interest in songwriting and, before long, was looking to put together a band and hosting try-outs for singers. It wasn't until friends told Adam that his voice didn't sound half-bad that he put any thought into singing.\n\n\n\nThroughout the years since, Adam's been involved in several projects - most notably his original band Black Magnolia. The band\u2019s debut album, \u201cFields Are Burning,\" was released in 2012 and featured Randy Jackson of Zebra, who played a guest guitar solo on the song \u201cApocalypse.\u201d He's opened for several major bands in his day including Zebra, 12 Stones, Filter, Puddle of Mudd, and Louisiana Leroux. He\u2019s also played major festivals throughout the South who's had headliners such as Foreigner, Kiss, Doobie Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Temptations, Sublime with Rome, Dee Snider, and Cowboy Mouth.\n\n\n\nAdam's success grew substantially following his appearance on NBC's \"The Voice\". He chose Adam Levine as his coach and made it to the Top 20 on Season 13 (as the \"comeback kid\" from Season 12). Shortly afterwards, Adam Levine invited him to sing for the Maroon 5 Annual Halloween party in 2017. That night they covered only AC/DC songs with Adam Pearce singing, Adam Levine on drums, James Valentine and Andrew Watt on guitar, and Milo Decruz on bass. The night became extra memorable when Sammy Hagar jumped on stage to join Adam Pearce singing \"Highway to Hell.\" The night before, they also surprised guests and performed for the Casamigos Annual Halloween Party.\n\n\n\nIn Decemeber 2017, thanks to the support of his amazing Backers, Adam launched a very successful Kickstarter Campaign which allowed him to bring his newest songs to life with a new album. This new album was recently released October 31, 2018 as Adam Pearce: WARBIRD, featuring Kyle Thomas of Exhorder, Terry McDermott of Lotus Crush, and Paul Mirkovich who's plays keys for and sings duets with Cher.\n\n\n\nAdam can currently be found performing his solo acoustic gigs as well as playing with his full band, Adam Pearce & The Warbirds, all over the state and across the south.

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to.

You will hear him talk about \u201cstaying constant,\u201d being \u201creal\u201d and \u201cnatural.\u201d They resonate in the songs he writes, those he chooses to record and in every aspect of his career.\nIt isn\u2019t that Tom Wurth does not embrace change and growth. He has experienced a lot of that musically as he met milestone after milestone in his career. At the same time though, he believes that music can be a \u201cconstant\u201d for most people and they crave consistency from an artist.\nWhether you sit down to talk about his career, where he has been, where he is going; or listen to the lyrics of each song, you will know his commitment to that real and natural music. It is music you can count on with every song and at every show.\nThe new album A Different Soul shows that commitment. There are deep roots that brace this album. Roots from his small town up-bringing to his musical roots that are evident with the collaborations found on this new project which includes Vince Gill, T. Graham Brown and John Ford Coley.\nOut of the gate, at only twenty years of age, Tom Wurth was nominated for a Grammy. That particular milestone built a foundation for his career. The Grammy experience fresh in his mind, Wurth pushed forward with his songwriting aspirations.\nWurth initially signed as a staff writer with Belden; later signing with one of the largest publishers in the world, BMG Music Publishing. At BMG he garnered two major record label cuts including; \u201cIf the Road Runs Out,\u201d appearing on This is Ty Herndon \u2013 Greatest Hits and a Ken Mellons cut, \u201cI Can\u2019t Kick My Country\u201d for a NASCAR compilation, Inside Traxx.\nTom Wurth found the best school was on the road playing and in the studio recording. He took to both and never looked back. He has shared a stage with some of the most respected and successful artists in music including\nVince Gill, John Ford Coley, T. Graham Brown, Eddie Money, Larry Gatlin and The Gatlin Brothers, Lonestar, Billy Dean, Ronnie Milsap, Rascal Flatts, Billy Currington, LoCash, Pam Tillis, Mel Tillis, Thompson Square, Marty Stuart, Tim Rushlow, Trick Pony, Clay Walker, Tony Coleman & many others.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Tom Wurth for several years. I\u2019ve always appreciated his friendship and what I\u2019ve always admired was his professionalism. As we say in Alabama \u2013 he\u2019s a hard charger. (He\u2019s a) great entertainer, and one of the true inspirations in this business!\u201d \u2013 Marty Raybon\nIn 2006 Wurth signed his first record deal, recorded and released his first album on Aspirion Records. The first release from Tom Wurth, \u201cBread On The Table,\u201d reached the top thirty on the charts as well as earned a spot on CMT.com for the single\u2019s video. Wurth\u2019s next two single releases (\u201cGood Ground,\u201d from the album Tom Wurth and \u201cIf The Road Runs Out,\u201d from If The Road Runs Out) also enjoyed top thirty chart status.\n\"Tom Wurth is a three-way hitter. He's a tremendously gifted vocalist and artist and a Grammy nominated artist. Tom has a genuine love for the song, strong and memorable melody-tunes that people can sing along with. Tom is truly a gifted singer with a style all his own. I think you'll love what you hear.\u201d - John Ford Coley\nThis quote may well explain the feelings both peers and fans have about Tom Wurth and his music. What you hear on Tom Wurth\u2019s records are exactly what you will hear on stage. No smoke, no mirrors just great music.\n\u201cSome time ago Vince Gill finished performing and sat next to me backstage ... I have the same remark about Tom as I said to Vince, \"You did more with just you and a guitar than the act that preceded you with a full band. This is a wonderful talent that should be a much bigger name because he understands what it means to get up on a stage and perform. A wonderful talent.\u201d \u2013 Sandy Smolen\nTom Wurth crossed paths with famed rocker Eddie Money leading to a friendship and several collaborations. Money asked him to produce a special project, The Other Side of Money. Wurth took on the project bringing in John Ford Coley to co-produce the project with him. The album included a remake of Money\u2019s song, \u201cGimme Some Water\u201d and featured Vince Gill. For Tom Wurth\u2019s new project, A Different Soul, Wurth and Money once again collaborated, along with Scott Soderberg, with their co-write of \u201cBack On The Highway Again.\u201d\n\u201cEvery once in a while, someone comes along that has the quality, that believability tone in their voice with a simple but honest emotion, like he\u2019s talking late at night to his sweetheart in a quiet driveway. It\u2019s a gift. Tom Wurth has that gift. \u2013 Eddie Money\nIn 2012, Wurth signed with TaDa Records recording the studio album, Midnight Rain. The album brings together Tom Wurth\u2019s soulful blend of country with his trademark additions of R&B and gospel. Midnight Rain was featured on iTunes New and Noteworthy right off the presses. Singles from the album included, \u201cTo Love Somebody,\u201d and \u201cDiggin in The Dirt.\u201d\nFor Tom Wurth, music isn\u2019t just a vocation, it defines him as a person. If he isn\u2019t crafting a new song, out on the road singing or in the studio recording his own music he often takes to the studio as a producer. His latest project is with John Ford Coley. Coley\u2019s latest album, Eclectic, is a 26 song collection co-produced by Wurth and features Vince Gill, Collin Raye, Jamie O\u2019Neal, Georgia Middleman and T. Graham Brown.\nYet, there is nothing Tom Wurth would rather be doing than singing. This past year and a half he has devoted everything to the making of A Different Soul. There is no \u201cfast forward\u201d to this latest project on TaDa Records.\nIt is part of his artistic progression and builds on his musical roots. A Different Soul has quickly become labeled \u201ca different style, a different sound.\u201d It is not \u201cdifferent\u201d for Tom Wurth, but gives that same \u201cconstant\u201d fans have come to expect from his music. But, it is music different from anything you have heard before.\nThe project includes a song he will say \u201cdefines him.\u201d \u201cWhere I Belong\u201d was written by Wurth with Vince Gill and features Gill on vocals and guitar. For Wurth it is another milestone in his career. Right next to that is another Wurth co-write, \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Build It,\u201d that has his soulful vocals paired with those of another soulful singer, T. Graham Brown. John Ford Coley also appears offering his talents with background vocals on two songs on the project, \u201cOnce A Lover (Always A Friend)\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Make Love.\u201d\nA Different Soul is produced by T. W. Cargile (who also co-produced Wurth\u2019s Midnight Rain) and Tony Coleman (former B.B. King drummer for thirty years).\n\u201cIn my lifetime as a musician, I have had the opportunity and honor to work with the world\u2019s greatest soulful singers \u2013 Otis Clay, Bobby Blue Bland, Johnnie Taylor, Etta James, B.B. King and others. Tom Wurth is one of those soulful singers that I can add to that list. The first time I heard him sing I knew immediately I had to work with him. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of co-producing him on his latest recording, A Different Soul. I consider his voice and singing to be as soulful as those great artists I\u2019ve worked with and grew up listing to whether jazz, blues, country or R&B. I know people from all over are going to like, A Different Soul just like I do.\u201d - Tony Coleman", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ed Helms ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Whiskey Sour Happy Hour Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gaura Vani Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7718034.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Kirtan, Acoustic, Mantra Music, World Music, Mantras", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "At the age of six Gaura Vani left the US to study sacred music in a gurukula or temple school in the timeless town of Vrindavan, India.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

Touring the US and 11 other countries both as a headliner, and supporting acts such as Bon Iver, Jewel, John Hiatt, Suzanne Vega, Seal Styx and Yes, the fiercely independent and hardworking artist has developed a loyal international fan base, has had his work appear in over 100 television shows and films, and recently had a solo acoustic track, \u201cSkyway Drive-In\u201d (from 2013\u2019s Ladera) cross over 6.5 million streams on Spotify.\n\nSince his debut, Alexander\u2019s last 4 records were produced with Billy Mohler (Grammy Nominated writer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist). Bliss, his 6th full-length studio record, and first self-production, was recroded at his new Buddhaland Studios located in Ventura County, CA. \u201cIt was an amazing experience to be at the helm in my own studio, at long last,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cthere are many first takes on this record, which led to the songs feeling organic and honest.\u201d\n\nBliss is a timeless tribute to both the artist's classic rock influences and more recent contemporaries such as Jonathan Wilson, Ryan Adams and Conor Oberst. Alexander\u2019s crystalline tenor and deft acoustic guitar are at the heart of all the tracks. The folk-light opener 'Evergreen' blends Paul Simon and Ram-era McCartney in its fingerpicked cadence and vivid lyrical imagery. \"Something Real Never Dies\" which calls to mind 80's bands like The Church and The Cure, is a dreamy pop rocker about lost loves that 'circle around you again and again.' The ultra-dark \"I Will Die Alone\" sounds like a forgotten gem, unearthed in a time capsule from the early 60's, with a Ricky Nelson-meets-Morricone vibe that you'll just want to put on repeat. \"Heart of California\" is a sun-soaked ode to all things west coast, with its driving Wilco/Petty energy, and the gorgeous lapsteel, courtesy of Ojai mainstay Jesse Siebenberg, who was also featured on Ladera, as well as many tracks on the new album.\n\nAlso returning from Ladera, is keyboardist Peter Adams, whose sonic explorations have graced records for Josh Groban, Tears for Fears, Ricki Lee Jones, Macy Gray and countless others.

Aaron Sterling (John Mayer, The Civil Wars, Taylor Swift) returning from 2010\u2019s Mono Solo, also provides drums and percussion to three tracks on Bliss.\n\nFor all of the heartache and lessons learned on the album, the closing title track leaves the listener on a sublime note of peace and forgiveness, one that is mirrored in the cover image, hand-drawn by veteran rock and roll artist Alan Forbes.\n\nFollowing the release of Bliss, Shane Alexander will tour the United States in summer and return to Europe in late fall 2016.\n\nThe Freedom Machine, the politically-charged new musical, written and directed by Emmy-winner Larry Carpenter, featuring songs written by Shane Alexander, is currently in pre-production in Los Angeles.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brad Brock ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9198136.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Indie Pop, One Man Band", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Brad Brock is an American singer/songwriter & one man band entertainer from the Treasure Coast of Florida and performs an eclectic mix of original songs, pop, blues, and reggae tunes arranged in his unique one man band style.

His music has taken him around the world, allowing him to work with diverse, respected artists and to connect with people everywhere\u2014from his albums released on Brushfire Records to recording with Belle and Sebastian in Glasgow, to penning film scores and releasing a variety of genre-bending EP\u2019s, and to finally coming home to Los Angeles\u2019s Dangerbird Records for his first new proper full-length release in nearly five years. A rebirth in a sense, through his keen pop sensibility, studious songwriting, technical mastery, and a modern-meets-vintage sound bursting with bite, Costa has recorded the album of his career, one sure to reach new shores and sailors alike.\n\n\u201cIn the past 15 years of my career, I feel I\u2019ve continually been breaking through, speaking out, and reaching different people,\u201d Costa says. \u201cIf one of my songs connects now to someone who didn\u2019t connect before, then we have a dialogue together. That\u2019s the point of music, to have that dialogue and tell a story, and to entertain with a sound that has depth.\u201d\n\nHe began the recording of Santa Rosa Fangs over a year and a half ago, though some songs here predate that mark. Over the past few years, Costa had challenged himself to explore new terrain, from the acoustic-fingerpicking/lo-fi garage/experimental sounds of 2015\u2019s EP\u2019s to the acid-washed and reverb-laden soundtrack to the film Orange Sunshine to another complete album that never saw the light of day. Realizing he sought a collection of dyed-in-the-wool songs rather than sonic experiments, in July of 2017 he and producers Peter Matthew Bauer (The Walkmen) and Nick Stumpf (French Kicks) entered a studio to begin work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference when I sit down to write sonic textures and when I sit with a guitar or piano and write a song,\u201d he says. \u201cThese new songs went back to a traditional sense, and when stripped back to their purest form, they still work. They tell a story, the melodies aren\u2019t leaning on anything, and they make instrumentation around them come to life in a new way, but their core is strong. My goal for the EP\u2019s was to develop conceptual ideas, making each one in a short period and with their own concepts; Orange Sunshine was a bigger exercise in that. Now, this record is all of those things I was exercising come into their own. It\u2019s more of a visualized record that takes you into the world of the Santa Rosa fangs.\u201d\n\nThe tale of Santa Rosa Fangs centers around a young woman named Sharon, her two brothers Ritchie and Tony, and their story of love, loss, and coming of age in a timeless yet contemporary California. It is replete with long distance love affairs and nostalgic romances woven through the loom of tragedy and time. Interestingly, rather than setting out to create a specific narrative, Costa began noticing a theme in the new songs as he wrote them: an unconscious embodiment of the surroundings in which he himself had grown up. According to Costa, the titular teeth refer to that inescapable feeling of a romantic, tragic, and eternal bite that certain places and events will always hold on us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve interwoven my own stories into a fictional idea of what \u2018Santa Rosa Fangs\u2019 is, from my own time spent living in Northern and Southern California and years driving up and down the coast, seeing the landscape and where life can pull you within one state,\u201d Costa says. \u201cIt is all these things\u2014the \u2018bite that is eternal, the smile in the neon\u2019\u2014and it has fangs. They stick with you: the romantic, the tragic, all that. It\u2019s the characters\u2019 story and my story, too, contemporary but still tortured by the past. It\u2019s a window into a time period but spoken as if it\u2019s the present. The beauty of love and loss doesn\u2019t have a date on it; it\u2019s timeless.\u201d\n\nThe album follows the siblings as they search for love and meaning in their lives, which are ultimately cut short by the passing of both brothers in unrelated accidents. Sharon, left battling with her own mortality and forced to see through a shattered lens, becomes the story\u2019s grieving, guarded hero and, as Costa says, is \u201ca little bit me, and a little bit everyone.\u201d Similarly, the origin of the characters has one foot in reality and one in the ether. The song \u201cRitchie\u201d is based on a true family saga, as two of Costa\u2019s cousins were twin brothers who died within a year of each other in motorcycle and car accidents in the early 1980s. Likewise, \u201cPhosphorescent Letter\u201d is the story of a local friend\u2019s daughter who endured a long-distance, online relationship with a boyfriend in Australia; in that dramatic situation Costa saw a through-line for Sharon\u2019s tale. \u201cBecause she is so tortured by loss she\u2019s afraid of love, so she sets herself up for a distant relationship, illuminated on her phone,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a real-love thing that happens frequently these days.\u201d\n\nOther concrete inspirations found their way into Santa Rosa Fangs as well. Costa imagined his creations in a setting similar to that of a Jim Jarmusch film, with dramatic events unfolding around them as they attempt to go about their daily lives as earnestly as possible. He also cites Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Nebraska as an influence for its songs and characters as well as its moments of sparseness. Like that iconic record, the cover of Santa Rosa Fangs is a stark black-and-white photograph tinged with deep red text, featuring three youths running along a freeway overpass. It\u2019s not clear whether the trio\u2014Costa\u2019s real-life Orange County neighbors\u2014are sprinting for joy or to escape some unknown entity; Costa hints that to him they are running away from the grabbing hands of time. \u201cThe song \u2018Time Tricks\u2019 is about that, too: it\u2019s inevitable and coming for you.\u201d\n\nCosta also found inspiration in working with Bauer and Stumpf, whom he had previously admired from a distance and whose music resumes he respects greatly. \u201cI really connected with Pete and Nick and took their lead on several ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you partner with someone\u2014you want their input. I shaped things a little differently by listening through their ears than I would have otherwise.\u201d Costa cites \u201cReal Love,\u201d an upbeat, heavy tune written in 5/4 time, as such a moment of collaboration. Originally intended as an acoustic song, he was encouraged by his producers to approach it from a fresh direction. \u201cI had done that sort of thing before, a Nick Drake, fingerpicking type thing,\u201d he says. \u201cPete and Nick inspired me to take it to a new place. To write a driving rock song in 5/4 is a real challenge, but I had the basis in my pattern and we all drove it home with a really strong beat. On my own I might have stuck with a simpler take, but it felt good to tackle some new ground.\u201d\n\nIn another circumstance, Costa again came up with two variations of the same song, but rather than being forced to choose between the two, he simply used both. As a result, \u201cI Remember It Well\u201d bookends the album, first as a rollicking, piano-driven number that sets the record\u2019s tone and pace, and second as a sparser, quiet version to end it. The latter was the initial version and was also the first song written for the album some four years ago. \u201cThat song is both the entrance and exit to this world, and also shows the process of how you can take a song, do it two ways, and both can be impactful and give you different feelings.\u201d\n\nNo matter how his process or approach may change\u2014in the present moment or in any era of coming-of-age throughout his decade-and-a-half-long career\u2014Costa recognizes that one unique thing in his work will always stay the same: his perspective. \u201cEssentially, what it comes down to is this: I sit down with a guitar, and these are songs,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard to understand how to produce them in certain ways. You can try to dress up a song and put a different sound to it, but if the song isn\u2019t that kind of song then it\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019ve had to exercise both of those qualities equally\u2014to know how to develop these sounds sonically, and then when I know sonically where I want it to go, I have to write to that.

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gabe Dixon Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6128416.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Singer & Songwriter, Folk, Acoustic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born and raised in Tennessee, Gabe Dixon is a Nashville-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist.

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015. Previous projects include Home to You from 2010, Topaz City in 2007; One of the Ways, 2002; Wide Afternoon, 2000; Comfort In the Curves, 1997; and three live releases (Sell-Out, 2006; Live From The Granada CD/DVD 2009 and Live At The Mucky Duck - Portmanteau, 2019).

They have pushed forward with a passion, and unrelenting drive that will see Renegade Station become a name that anyone hearing their unique pop and rock-infused brand of country music is unlikely to forget.\nOriginally known as Domino, the band came together almost accidentally as husband and wife duo of singer/bassist Luanne and guitarist Russell Carl began attending and performing at a town variety show in Stettler, not long after moving to the rural Alberta community. There they met guitarist/vocalist Kent Nixon and drummer Scott McKnight at the popular event and decided to create a band to play local dances and parties becoming the \u2018go to\u2019 act on the circuit.\n\u201cWe were the backing band at this event and decided to take the show on the road, playing a lot of rodeo dances and weddings. But after a few years we realized we had something special. We just gelled as musicians and our voices harmonized so well together that we all just felt we needed to do more. So, we acquired ourselves a professional manager and began recording some originals and some songs that were gifted to us,\u201d said Luanne.\nTheir new name is symbolic of the group\u2019s unconventional approach to their music and sense of independence. They are unabashed about injecting their original music and the songs presented to them by other noted songwriters with healthy doses of pop and classic rock nuances \u2013 with a focus on lushly produced and beautiful layered vocal harmonies which owe as much to Fleetwood Mac as they do to Lady Antebellum.\nThe \u201cStation\u201d part of their name is a nod to vintage working steam train that is a tourist attraction in Stettler and which is a throwback to the region\u2019s pioneering past. Therefore, a name that is reverent towards tradition, but which also alludes to a desire to go one\u2019s own way is ideal for the band approaches their craft.\nAs proof of Renegade Station\u2019s commitment to excellence, for the recording of Along for the Ride, they worked with respected industry veteran Johnny Gasparic (Gord Bamford, George Canyon, Snoop Dogg) at Dave Temple\u2019s MCC Recording Studio in Calgary. It was the second time working with Gasparic, but this time around Luanne said he became more integral to the creative process as well as the recording process.\n\u201cWe collaborated a lot more with him on the production side and it was awesome. He brings an amazing background and experience with him. He knows that we are very much a vocal band and a harmony band, and he really helped to emphasize that, but was also able to get us to do some things vocally that we hadn\u2019t done before. He really got us to relax and open up. I don\u2019t think we have ever sounded this good,\u201d she said.\nThe lead-off single, Who\u2019s Gonna Love Me Tonight, fits into the more adventurous approach that is Renegade Station\u2019s hallmark. Sung by Kent who shares lead vocal duties with Luanne, it\u2019s a mature, somewhat saucy but very true-to-life take on modern romance.\n\u201cWe were really drawn to the song at first because of the amazing harmonies, but then once we got a sense of the meaning and message we knew we had to record it. It\u2019s a little different and a little more risqu\u00e9 than a traditional country romantic song. It\u2019s not the normal \u2018I love you and you love me\u2019 song. It\u2019s a little more mature and realistic. Who is going to go home with who? Who is the strong person in the song, and who is the one going to just give in to the temptation of the moment,\u201d Luanne said.\nDon\u2019t Hold Your Breath was penned primarily by Nashville-based Canadian singer/songwriter Jaida Dreyer and, again, the breathtakingly infectious harmonies fit the Renegade Station sound so well, they could not resist putting it on Along for the Ride.\n\u201cThe song has this Little Big Town vibe, with an incredible melody and when we first harmonized together to the song we all just looked at each other with these amazed expressions. It is such a good song for us to really show off not only our country influences but how we can really bring that together with our pop and rock background. And I personally love this song because it\u2019s about being a strong woman,\u201d she said.\nProving that there is true musical versatility in Renegade Station, the song Rodeo Road is written by Joni Delaurier and pays tribute to the western rodeo lifestyle, which has special meaning for Nixon that comes across in his passionate vocal performance.\n\u201cKent\u2019s grandfather is in the Canadian Professional Rodeo Hall of Fame. His father in law is in the Hall of Fame. His three brothers in laws are Canadian Pro Rodeo Champion\u2019s and there is a long line of cowboys and rodeo competitors in his family. That song was so special to him and we all loved it too and wanted it there as a sort of throwback to that gritty traditional country sound that we all grew up with. It represents a big part of the Alberta mystique and the importance of rural life, the rodeo circuit and the country dances that are part of so many people\u2019s lives here,\u201d Luanne said.\nThe rock-solid foundation that was built as Domino is not being shunted aside as the talented quartet moves forward. Renegade Station\u2019s legacy is etched deep into the firmament of the western Canadian music scene and that can never be taken from them. In recent years they have won back to back Association of Country Music in Alberta, as Group of the Year (2015 and 2016) as well as the ACMA Fan\u2019s Choice of the Year in 2015. They also garnered a CCMA nomination for songwriter of the year for their tune 2:15 and Luanne was also nominated for CCMA Bass Player of the Year for 2016.\nThe band has shared the stage with a who\u2019s who of Canadian and international country music luminaries, from George Canyon and Carolyn Dawn Johnson, to David Lee Murphy, Emerson Drive, and Bobby Wills.\nAlong for the Ride is a bold statement by a collection of talented musicians and songwriters that is infused with authenticity, impressive vocal performances and insistent melodies that will stick with you for days.\nAnd with this impressive collection of new songs, a live show that never fails to enchant and entertain, and an unparalleled creative drive, Renegade Station is truly poised to break through to a national and international stage.", "otherInfo": "Join us for Quarantine Match Game on Wednesday Night!

Meanwhile, gliding his fingers across the keys is Reece Marshburn, letting loose a symphony of intricate melodies rooted in a combination of classical, jazz and pop music.\n\nThe resulting combination is a unique pop confection drawing on decades of influences, as if Cole Porter, Carole King, Dusty Springfield, Freddie Mercury, Paul Simon, Rufus Wainwright and Regina Spektor combined forces and filtered their unique compositions through classical maestros and film composers, then sprinkled it with a keen pop sensibility and a commitment to putting on the most involving, charismatic and personalized live shows this side of the Copacabana.\n\nThe Bylines have used their unique-yet-familiar sound to play to audiences large and small throughout the country, and have released both a studio(self titled, recorded by Bob Stark at Kung Fu Bakery) and a live album(The Bylines Live, recorded at the Alberta Rose Theatre in Portland, OR). The Bylines are proud alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriting Project, and have had support from the Regional Arts and Culture Council.\n\nWhether performing as a Thielen/Marshburn duo or with a larger band, the result is a blend of butter-smooth melodies, densely layered songwriting and powerful vocals. Most importantly, though, The Bylines musical cocktail goes down easy, and emphasizes something that is so often forgotten when such prolific songwriters present their craft: listening to music is, above all, supposed to be an experience\u2026 and a fun one.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "NIKI ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9575553.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Rock, Country, Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Niki aka Kairit Tuhkanen is Estonian Pop singer.

In 2015, Margo Price was a country underdog just trying to keep enough gas in the tank to get to the next gig, but by the end of 2016, she was one of the genre's most celebrated new artists and a ubiquitous presence on late night television and at major festivals around the world. It's the kind of year most musicians can only dream of, and the arrival of Price's spectacular sophomore album, \"All American Made,\" proves that she hasn't taken a moment of it for granted. Delivering on the promise of her debut and then some, the record finds Price planting her flag firmly in the soil as a songwriter who's here for the long haul, one with the chops to hang with the greats she so often finds herself sharing stages with these days.\n\n\"People have started asking me, 'Now that you're having success, what are you going to write about?'\" Price recounts with a laugh. \"A lot of what I wrote on my debut came out of my struggles in the music business, but we don't have any shortage of material now. I'm just excited to finally have an audience and know that people are going to listen to our songs.\"\n\nA prolific writer with a knack for candid self-reflection, Price has never had to look too far for inspiration, and on 'All American Made,' she and her songwriting partner/husband, Jeremy Ivey, continue to depict the trials of everyday life with unflinching honesty, painting poetically plainspoken portraits of men and women just trying to get by. Highs and lows, long nights and hard days, wild women and cocaine cowboys, politics and sexism, it's all in there, singularly filtered through Price's wry, no-bullshit perspective. Throughout the album, her contemporary take on classic sounds is at once familiar and daring, an infectious blend of Nashville country, Memphis soul, and Texas twang that tips its cap to everyone from Waylon and Willie (who makes a guest appearance) to Loretta and Dolly, all while flipping a middle finger to the cookie-cutter pop that dominates modern country radio. Rich with swirling pedal steel, honky-tonk rhythms, and Price's stop-you-in-your-tracks vocals, 'All American Made' is deeply reverent of tradition even as it challenges conventions, a nuanced exploration of conflicted emotions for our deeply conflicted times.\n\nFar from overnight, Price's recent meteoric rise is the product of more than a decade of hard work and sacrifice. While she'd long been one of East Nashville's best-kept-secrets, she burst onto the international scene with the 2016 release of her first solo album, 'Midwest Farmer's Daughter.' The record debuted in the Top 10 on Billboard's Country Albums chart and graced Best-Of lists everywhere from Entertainment Weekly to NPR Music, who called it \"the hard-won arrival of an artist who feels like she's always been here.\" Vulture described Price as \"one of the most compelling country talents to come out of Nashville in recent memory,\" while Pitchfork hailed the album as \"a potential classic,\" and Rolling Stone praised its \"amazingly vivid songcraft.\" Price solidified her next-big-thing status with stellar performances on Saturday Night Live, Colbert, Fallon, CBS This Morning, Seth Meyers, A Prairie Home Companion, and more, in addition to taking home Emerging Artist of the Year honors at the Americana Music Awards and winning The American Music Prize for the year's best debut album. She shared stages and bills with Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, and Chris Stapleton among others, and her compelling story-years of toil in the Nashville trenches, the loss of her family's farm and the tragic death of her infant child, a brush with the law, selling her car and pawning her wedding ring to afford studio time, signing to Jack White's Third Man Records as the label's first country artist-was recounted in glowing profiles everywhere from the NY Times Magazine and the New Yorker to Morning Edition and Fader.\n\nWhen it was time to record the follow-up, Price and her band headed back to Memphis, TN, where they'd cut 'Midwest Farmer's Daughter' on a shoestring budget. Instead of returning to Sun Studios, though, they moved down the street to the larger Sam Phillips Recording studio, which the legendary producer opened in 1960 when his own skyrocketing success necessitated more space.\n\n\"We recorded live again because that's really how I like to work,\" Price explains. \"We'd get in around ten or eleven each morning, and then after about twelve hours of recording, we'd all start yelling for tequila, take a shot, and then just keep going.\"\n\nThat spirited, energetic atmosphere infuses even the record's darkest moments with a potent sense of vitality. On the uptempo album opener \"Don't Say It,\" Price dishes out sardonic wordplay over smoking hot guitar, while the pedal-steel and fiddle-fueled \"Weakness\" toes the line between sobriety and mayhem, and the tender \"Learning To Lose\" finds her living out a country music fantasy as she duets with Willie Nelson.\n\n\"We'd gotten to know him a bit from playing shows together and I idolized the hell out of him,\" says Price. \"I didn't know there were people like that, who'd achieved such massive stardom but remained so down to earth.\"\n\nOld school country may be the album's most obvious touchstone, but Price and her band incorporate 60's and 70's R&B into many of the arrangements here, fusing two of Tennessee's greatest musical exports. The funky \"Do Right By Me\" shimmies and grooves with Gospel legends The McCrary Sisters helping out on backing vocals, and the driving \"A Little Pain\" gets an assist from sweeping orchestration by Memphis legend Lester Snell (the man responsible for the string arrangements in \"Shaft\").\n\n\"Sometimes you feel like you've got to please everybody, but ultimately you should be the one you're worrying about taking care of,\" Price says of the inspiration behind the song. \"I wrote it pretty quickly just thinking about being on the road and trying to keep it together while you're burning the candle at both ends.\"\n\nThey say write what you know, and there are few things Price knows better than the road and the myriad of obstacles facing women who make their living on it. On \"Pay Gap,\" she laments the financial state of gender inequality (\"why don't you do the math? / Pay gap, pay gap / Ripping my dollar in half,\" she sings), and \"Wild Women\" looks at the hypocrisies of what's expected from male musicians compared to their female counterparts.\n\n\"There's a definite double standard,\" says Price, \"but I think if you're out there long enough, you stop giving any fucks and you just want to call it out. I get asked questions in interviews that no man would be asked, and if I'm assertive about what I want for me and my band, I get called a 'diva.' That song is really about the judgment I get from people who act like women shouldn't be out on the road. Girls should be encouraged to follow their careers and their dreams just as much as men.\"\n\nThe album closes with an intimate, acoustic rendition of \"All American Made,\" a song which calls to mind \"Born In The USA\" with its patriotic-sounding title and far more troubled lyrics.\n\n\"We actually wrote that song during the Obama administration,\" says Price, \"but it really altered meaning for me on the day Trump was elected. That song embodies the good and the bad in the ugly in this country. America is so beautiful to me, but it's in a really hard spot right now. I feel like I was one of the first and only country artists to speak out so openly against Trump, and I had a lot of people tell me I shouldn't be giving my opinion, but as far as I'm concerned, there's not a lot of doubt about the difference between right and wrong.\"\n\nThat candor is part of what makes 'All American Made' such a powerful follow-up release. Price could have taken her moment in the spotlight as an opportunity to homogenize and chase a slicker, more polished sound built for radio and arenas, but instead, she doubled down on the grit and the truth in her music.

She is a veritable triple-threat of musical talent as a guitarist, songwriter and vocalist. As with many blues women of the past, Foley has a long history of defying convention, and being a positive role model for aspiring, young female musicians.\n\nThe Canadian has been working professionally since the age of 16, and by the age of 21, Foley had relocated to Austin, TX and began recording for Antone\u2019s\u2014the esteemed blues label and historic nightclub that helped launch the career of Stevie Ray Vaughan and many others. In the two decades that have followed, Sue Foley has been busy touring and recording steadily, all while toting her signature pink paisley Fender Telecaster. In 2001, she won the prestigious Juno Award (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy) and also holds the record for the most Maple Blues Awards and has earned three Trophees de Blues de France. She has also garnered several nominations at the Blues Music Awards in Memphis, TN.\n\nWith 11 recordings under her own name, an instructional DVD and book, as well as various compilations and projects, Foley is set to release her new album, The Ice Queen (March 2, 2018) on Stony Plain Records. \u201cI\u2019m extremely excited to be working with Holger Petersen and Stony Plain Records. Holger is one of the most knowledgeable \u201creal music\u201d people in the business\u201d, says Foley. \u201cStony Plain is known to put out great music and I know The Ice Queen has found her home.\u201d\n\nRecorded throughout 2017, The Ice Queen represents Foley\u2019s full circle journey \u2013 her return to the roots of her career in Austin with producer Mike Flanigin. The album was recorded with her long-time friends and collaborators Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons (ZZ Top) as well Chris \u2018Whipper\u2019 Layton from Double Trouble, Charlie Sexton, and members of the Tedeschi Trucks and Gary Clark Jr bands.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teenager I idolized Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons,\u201d Foley says. \u201cThey're both legends now so this feels like an historical event (at least it does for me). And I grew up sitting at the feet of players like George \u2018Big Beat\u2019 Rains, Derek O'Brien and The Texas Horns. I spent many nights watching Charlie Sexton and the Arc Angels with Chris Layton. I learned and grew more musically in my years in Austin than at any point in my life. The fact that all these mega talented musicians have graced my album is beyond anything I hoped for. I am still pinching myself.\u201d\n\nA flood of inspiration and themes can be found on each of the tracks \u2013 ranging from lost love, anguish, and struggle to release, forgiveness and rebirth. Mostly recorded live-off-the-floor, Foley\u2019s emotional vocal delivery, conviction, accessible yet inspired lyrics and intrepid guitar playing are all laid out, bare and raw for the songs to reveal.\n\nOpening with the radio friendly and funky \u201cCome to Me\u201d, The Ice Queen also features upbeat and rollicking tracks \u201cRun\u201d, \u201cThe Lucky ones\u201d (a duet with Jimmie Vaughan) and \u201cGaslight\u201d. There are several bluesy and soulful tracks including \u201c81\u201d, \u201cThe Ice Queen\u201d, \u201cFool's Gold\u201d (featuring Billy F Gibbons on vocals and harmonica)\u201d, \u201cIf I Have Forsaken You\u201d, and a cheeky, guitar-heavy cover of Bessie Smith\u2019s \u201cSend Me To The \u2018Lectric Chair\u201d. Foley also provides some more mellow and unexpected songs on The Ice Queen with the jazzy \u201cDeath of a Dream\u201d, the flamenco-blues hybrid \u201cThe Dance\u201d and a beautiful cover of the Carter Family\u2019s \u201cCannonball Blues\u201d.\n\nThe Ice Queen represents Sue Foley\u2019s indefatigable commitment to her craft, and her transparency with the journey that birthed her, further proving that\nyou can\u2019t keep a good blueswoman down, particularly when she is The Ice Queen.\n\nsuefoley.com", "otherInfo": "Texas Blues Party, the NEW weekly livestream show featuring Sue Foley & Mike Flanigin.

At the age of 21, he moved to El Paso Tx, where he began to make his way with the American public participating in programs such as \"America\u2019s Got Talent\u201d in Austin, Texas and California. In 2017 he released his first album: \u201cA New Beginning\u201d of original themes from the New Age genre, including some Waltzes, most of the pieces are inspired by moments he personally experienced or reflections.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.'

It's a sound rooted in big melodies, blasts of brass, percussive punch, and old-school grooves, with songs that shine a light not only on frontwoman Alanna Quinn-Broadus' larger-than-life voice, but her songwriting chops, too.\n\nThe band formed in Nashville, where Alanna and guitarist Jared Colby relocated after cutting their teeth as working-class musicians in Boston. Once in Tennessee, they teamed up with drummer Matt Snow, and bassist Gabriel Golden, forming a core lineup that often swells to as many as ten members -- including backup vocalists and a two-piece horn section -- in concert. Together, the band looked beyond Nashville's country-filled past and, instead, took inspiration from Motown's soul, Stax's funky strut, and rock & roll's rebellion. Tattooed, brash, and unapologetically unique, they stood out in a town dominated by Americana music, charting a unique course whose highlights have since included an appearance at Bonnaroo, a string of cross-country shows supporting acts like Lee Fields and St. Paul and the Broken Bones, and an audience that celebrates the band's diversity.\n\nOn their fourth release, 2018's So Bad You Can Taste It, Alanna matches the brassy spirit of the band's previous records \u2014 including their full-length debut, Achilles \u2014 with rare vulnerability. There's still plenty of soulful stomp here, from the upbeat sweep of the record's lead single, \"I Know,\" to the funky fire of \"Giving It All Away.\" There's also a more mature, sober look at the demands thrust upon independent artists \u2014 or anyone's who's willing to chase down an uncertain horizon, no matter how rough the journey may be. With songs that examine the midpoint between desperation and drive, So Bad You Can Taste It is the band's most genuine work to date.\n\n\"There are mountains and valleys to any journey, and this record is about being in the valley,\" explains Alanna Quinn-Broadus. \"It's about the low moments. It's basically the opposite of someone's Instagram feed, because it's not a highlights reel. It's just real.\"\n\nLow moments notwithstanding, So Bad You Can Taste It marks a creative high for Alanna Royale, whose members recorded the record's six songs with producer Kelly Finnigan and engineer Mindy Watts across multiple studios. Joining them were guests like trombonist Nadav Nirenberg -- known for his work alongside artists like Wyclef Jean, Breakdown Brass, and Wu Tang -- as well as Kirk Donovan, Meggan Utech, and Alexis Saski. Working with this expanded crew, Alanna Royale carved out a song-based sound that targeted not only their audience's dancing shoes, but their heads and hearts, too. Songs like the powerful, poignant ballad \"I Used to Dream\" were reworked multiple times, resulting in a record that's nuanced, heartfelt, and unafraid to show off its own scars.\n\n\"The title, So Bad You Can Taste It, says it all,\" Alanna explains. \"This record is all about the idea of something that's in front of you, and you can see it and feel it, but it's just out of reach. That thing can be your sanity or your sobriety or your success. I sometimes think it's harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel, rather than not seeing any light at all. Once you know the possibility of light is there, you have no option but to go after it. That can be really hard and really dangerous\u2026which makes it really worthwhile to sing about.\"", "otherInfo": "hey dolls, i'm pairing up with the good people at Marathon Music Works for my very first live stream ever. the show will be free but of course, donations/tips are very much welcome. find more details at the FB event below. stay smart, stay safe. love you all. xx\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1216868255371665"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bonstone ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10342844.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Pop, Folk Rock, Power Pop, Rock", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bonstone is a group effort.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st. It has not yet come out in the United States.\n\nTaken from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Sinclar)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sebastian ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9636125.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Electro", "Time": "12:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Thirst: SebastiAn, Act II. It only took eight years of waiting for one of the most unique artists to finally deliver a new dose of contemporary electro pyrotechnics and a worthy successor to the smashing Total. During those eight years, SebastiAn successfully completed a 360\u00b0 turn. Plus, it\u2019s been eight years of putting his talent to the good use of others (Frank Ocean, Philippe Katerine, Charlotte Gainsbourg) to help him get to where he wants to be today. From European electro to American R&B via classic pop, Thirst sets ablaze all genres. His taste for explosive mechanisms (like his well-known \u201cturbine\u201d techno sub-genre label-mates at Ed Banger) made Total an elegantly revolutionary debut album that captivatingly took things to the extreme, while being as frightening as a ticking bomb. But now, the wait is over. Thirst bursts forward providing an amazing opening to brand new worlds. This 14-track adventure narrates the journey of how he mastered machines, his own demons and even several time zones.\n\n\u201cThe general approach to this record corresponds to the time when Frank Ocean called me in Paris, telling me I had to be in Los Angeles the next day to work alongside him,\u201d reveals SebastiAn. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019d met Charlotte Gainsbourg to produce her latest album. So I found myself working with these two opposing personalities: on one side you\u2019ve got Frank Ocean, who\u2019s ultra charismatic and fanciful, while on the other, Charlotte Gainsbourg is both an introvert yet so openly real. When Charlotte moved to New York, Frank landed in London, and so the work process suddenly switched. I found this really interesting. My record came about from all the encounters I made going between these two projects.\u201d The energy from such contrasts brought this project to life, provoking SebastiAn to call upon an impressive list of artists to feature on Thirst (Syd from The Internet, Mayer Hawthorne, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Allan Kingdom, Sevdaliza, Cautious Clay, Sunni Col\u00f2n, Sparks, Gallant and Loota). \u201cFrom Ed Banger to Jean-Louis Costes and Katerine, or Frank Ocean to Charlotte Gainsbourg, my music has always looked to build bridges,\u201d outlines the self-confessed fan of DJ Premier, Giorgio Moroder and Suicide, who\u2019s managed to bring different styles together as one on this record. From this head-on collision between cold European techno and the warm tones of R&B, hip-hop and American gospel comes a series of explosions which progressively topple towards unchartered territories. With a certain Slavic melancholy that\u2019s an homage to his roots, SebastiAn makes the single Beograd evolve from metronomic dirty disco to a melody of cinematographic stature worthy of De Roubaix, entangled in a Chopin-esque lamenting sonata. The art of SebastiAn is certainly the art of suspense. He\u2019s like a tightrope walker, juggling a balancing act from the intimate to the epic (just take Run For Me which is a tour de force), and from minimalism to baroque to create a mystical form of electronic music. Thirst has such a contemporary edge to it, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s not aiming for a total collision between music\u2019s major current trends (electro and R&B), but in fact he\u2019s looking to rearrange the rules, settling alight the history of pop (The Beach Boys-eque Better Now) and rock (Handcuffed To A Parking Meter reaching dizzying heights with his idols Sparks), and a certain classicism in a recurring dialogue between strings, piano and knob-twiddling machines.\n\nIn 2011, for the cover work for Total, Jean-Baptiste Mondino captured SebastiAn as a modern-day Narcissus, photographing the musician kissing his alter ego. Eight years later, the same photographer once again depicts the artist with his double, however this time the love affair has ended and it\u2019s fists up ready for a fight. To sum up this game of metaphors, Thirst is a beefed-up declaration of love - not of SebastiAn to himself, but to the world around him. Thirst leaves you thirsty for more.", "otherInfo": "Meditate with Stuart"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SK Shlomo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359643.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Beatbox, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After collaborating with Ed Sheeran, Bjork and Damon Albarn, award winning singer-songwriter, beatboxer, producer & live looping technologist SK Shlomo's acclaimed debut solo album 'Surrender' is out now raising #MentalHealthAwareness: http://skshlomo.com/listen", "otherInfo": "This Thursday, and for the next 6 Thursdays at 2pm BST, I'm launching a weekly livestream called Homeskool Beatbox Adventures to help isolated families and raise funds for NHS Charities Together.\n\nWe're partnering with 80 music venues to simulcast the livestream to thousands of homes worldwide, with weekly special guests including Basement Jaxx, Bastille, Bill Bailey, Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall and Radio 1\u2019s Dr Radha helping me to raise a target of \u00a32500 to help frontline staff, patients and families affected by COVID19.\n\nThe show will be livestreamed on our brand new beatboxadventures.com website, on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAnd you can be part of the show!\n\nEach week I am inviting a virtual studio audience of up to 50 lucky families to join me in our digital theatre - also known as the \u2018Zoom Room\u2019.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Paul Roush ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10299185.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Port Charlotte, Florida", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Playing the songs of some of the world's best singer-songwriters for over 30 years, Paul has been able to\ntake all of those influences and develop his own particular songwriting style.

She was a piano prodigy from the beginning, playing by ear at age 2 1/2, and writing her own songs by age 4. It's been said that by age 5, she could play anything on the piano after hearing it only once. She won a scholarship at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland - the youngest person ever to be admitted there. She often ran into trouble there, as they discouraged her from composing her own music. She was kicked out at age 11 for playing classic rock tunes from Led Zeppelin and The Beatles by ear, which the institute deemed unacceptable.\n\nShe started playing clubs at the age of 13, accompanied by her father as a chaperone, which continued through high school. In 1977, she won a local (Montgomery County, Maryland) talent contest. In 1980, at the age of 17, she even released her first single, Baltimore/Walking With You, on the MEA label (her initials). She received a citation from the mayor of Baltimore for the song.\n\nShe adopted the name Tori, also at the age of 17, after a friend remarked that she looked like a Tori. After graduating from high school, she performed at hotels (both old standards and some of her own material) while taking some music classes at a local college.\n\nIn 1984, at the age of 21, she moved out on her own to Hollywood. She played solo in clubs to earn money and did a few television commercials.\n\nIn 1987, she formed the pop band Y Kant Tori Read, and signed under Atlantic Records. In May of 1988, the debut album was released and proceeded to flop miserably. Even today, with Tori's success, Atlantic has kept this album out of publication at Tori's request. \"It was a different time; I was in a different place. Everything was over the top -- the high hair, everything. I was shopping at Retail Slut.\" Soon after, she decided to go back to the girl and her piano. In fall 1989, Atlantic gave her one more shot at doing an album. The next March, she gave them a tape of her songs and received the go-ahead to start recording. They later rejected the master tape, and she became even more determined.\n\nIn 1991 she wrote Me And A Gun a few hours before a show and performed it that night. In October of that year, it was released as a single. It was received well in the UK, and Atlantic decided to release her first album, Little Earthquakes, there. It debuted at #15 on the charts and was quickly followed up by a release in the US.\n\nHer second album, Under the Pink, was released in 1994. During production, Atlantic Records wanted to bring in a new producer for the album. However, as she liked her producer, this did not please her, and she threatened to burn her master tapes. Atlantic relented and ended up with another successful album. Soon after, she helped found R.A.I.N.N. - Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network.\n\nIn December of 1995, she distributed her single Caught a Lite Sneeze over the internet, which was the first single by any artist to be distributed in that manner. The rest of the album Boys for Pele was released in 1996. It received more notice by her parents - her father originally thought the song \"Father Lucifer\" was about him, and she was forced to explain that the song was derived from somewhere else completely. \"No! I was taking drugs with a South American shaman and I really did visit the Devil and I had a journey.\"\n\nLate in 1996, she discovered she was pregnant by Mark Hawley, one of the sound engineers of her Dew Drop Inn Tour. But two days before Christmas, she suffered a miscarriage, only three months into the pregnancy. The miscarriage provided the focus for a new set of songs, which became From The Choirgirl Hotel, her first album recorded with other musicians joining her live, going past the girl and her piano sound.\n\n\"The songs started coming not long after I miscarried. The strange thing is, the love doesn't go away for this being that you've carried. You can't go back to being the person you were before you carried life. And yet you're not a mother, either, and you still are connected to a force, a being. And I was trying to find ways to keep that communication going. Along the way on the search, sort of walking with the undead, I would run into these songs. The one thing they kept saying to me was I had to find a deep woman's rhythm. You begin to create where you can. If you can't create physical life, you find a life force. If that's in music, that's in music. I started to find this deep, primitive rhythm, and I started to move to it. And I held hands with sorrow, and I danced with her, and we giggled a bit. And this record really became about being alive enough to feel things, no matter what that is.\"\n\nIn February 1998, she was married to Mark in a small ceremony at the Church of St Lawrence in West Wycombe, England. Her father was there to give her away - which was a suprise to some, as the two have had a rocky relationship at times.\n\nTori released To Venus and Back in 1999, her first double album. The first disc contained fresh studio material, while the second disc claimed to capture some of the magic from her live performances. Many saw this 2-CD package as nothing more than a cynical marketing ploy that forced fans to purchase to two CD's just to hear an album worth of new material. Indeed, there was virtually nothing stylistically similar between the two disks that would warranted the bundling.\n\nOn September 5, 2000, Tori gave birth to her daughter, Natashya L\u00f3rien Hawley.\n\nIn 2001, Tori's sixth album, Strange Little Girls, was released. It consists of 12 covers of various songs, all originally written by men about women.\n\n2002 saw the release of her seventh album, Scarlet's Walk, released at the end of October. Some of the songs on the album come from stories that one set of her grandparents, who were eastern Cherokee, used to tell her as a child. Others were a result of, or at least influenced by, the events on September 11, 2001.\n\nIn 2003, Tori released Tales of a Librarian, a greatest hits collection for which she revisited many of her favorite songs as well as adding a few new songs for her fans.\n\n2005 presented us with The Beekeeper, a somewhat more accessible album than some of her earlier work. In conjunction with the album, Amos released an autobiography entitled Piece by Piece in February 2005; co-authored by rock music journalist Ann Powers, it delves deeply into Amos\u2019 obsession with mythology and religion. It explores her songwriting process while telling the story of her progression into fame.\n\nDuring 2005, Amos negotiated a contract with the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino to release a string of reissues and compilations. The first release of the deal was the two-disc DVD set Fade to Red: The Video Collection in February 2006, which contained all but three of Amos' solo music videos, as well as behind-the-scenes footage and commentary. The contract continued in September 2006 with the release of the career-spanning five-disc box set A Piano: The Collection, celebrating Tori's 15-year solo career. The set includes various album songs, singles, remixes, alternate mixes, demos, outtakes, and a string of unreleased songs from album sessions - \"Ode to My Clothes,\" \"Peeping Tommi,\" \"Not David Bowie,\" \"Dolphin Song,\" and the much-mythologised \"Zero Point,\" which Tori mentioned in interviews as well as the liner notes to 1999's To Venus and Back. The collection is lavishly packaged to resemble a piano keyboard.\n\n\nTori is well known for her extremely dedicated fans, Toriphiles, and the 'Net fans Tori herself has nicknamed Ears With Feet. A group of these fans are due to her song, Me And A Gun, which has helped many deal with their own rapes. Michael Stipe, from R.E.M., once even remarked to Tori, \"Hey, can I borrow your audience?\"\n\nOne of her primary influences is Joni Mitchell. Another is Kate Bush. She is well known for her very enigmatic lyrics, especially on the newer albums. She's often said that she likes to challenge the fans, and knows they like it when she does.\n\nHer ninth studio album, American Doll Posse, was released on May 1st and the ensuing tour began on May 28 in Rome, Italy.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Laura Wyatt ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9451384.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Acoustic, Adult R&b, Jazz Blues, Country Gospel, Acoustic Blues, Alt-country, Soul Jazz, Adult Alternative, Country, Adult Contemporary", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Laura Wyatt from Suffolk has recently returned to the original music scene.

One of our most compelling singers, she is at home in R&B but made her mark in country, bringing the entire spectrum of popular music to bear on music she calls \u201cSouthern Soul.\u201d\n\nHer new album, Revival, is her most powerful work to date. The product of a mature artistic vision, laser-focused social consciousness, and a voice with the power and grace only experience can bring, it is also her most important work. Revival finds Rissi dealing with some of the most pressing issues of the times, as well as with the personal realms of love, loss, and identity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most personal things I\u2019ve written and recorded,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything I write is personal, but I feel like I\u2019m in a place of being really honest and transparent with people, because that\u2019s what I like in an artist. That\u2019s what I look for; those are the people I\u2019m interested in, and I want to do that same thing for others.\u201d\n\nThe first single from the project, \u201cSeeds,\u201d along with its riveting video, finds Rissi taking an unflinching look at tensions as old as humanity and as fresh as today\u2019s headlines, with a message that joins biblical themes and modern equality movements. \u201cSeeds\u201d celebrates human freedom and dignity in the face of oppression, counseling understanding and communication in a spirit of hope and unity.\n\n\u201c\u2018Seeds\u2019 is a crowd favorite and has been since I wrote it,\u201d she says, \u201cand so it was the first thing I recorded and put out from this record. It\u2019s the first thing you hear on the album and it sets the tone for everything else you\u2019re about to hear.\u201d\n\nTwo of the other key tracks are \u201cSoul Message,\u201d written just after she married her husband Bryan, and the powerful \u201cYou Were Here,\u201d written after her miscarriage.\n\n\u201c\u2018Soul Message\u2019 is the only love song on this album, and having been married now for nine years I feel like this is pretty expressive of what marriage is. There are times when all you can do is dig deeper and reach out to each other from a visceral soul place because regular communication is not getting it. It\u2019s one of my favorite songs on the record, and I love the production that Brian Owens, my producer, came up with. It just totally fits, with this kind of old Muscle Shoals-ish vibe. \u2018You Were Here\u2019 is probably one of the hardest songs I\u2019ve ever written. Thank God for my cowriters Deanna Walker and Rick Beresford\u2014I think I sobbed the entire time we wrote it. I was struck by how many of my friends have experienced this and don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s a profoundly lonely experience even if you have a partner, and I just didn\u2019t want people to feel alone anymore.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the project reflects Rissi\u2019s engagement with a world clearly in need of uplift, with songs of exhortation like \u201cBreathe In\u201d and \u201cRevival,\u201d and of compassion and hope, as in \u201cLittle Black Boy, Little Black Girl.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of Georgia natives, Rissi was born near Pittsburgh and spent her adolescent years in Missouri. Raised in a musical family that loved both country and R&B, she sang in a singing and dancing troupe sponsored by a local television station at 16. She was offered her first publishing and label deals at 19, and in 2007 released the album Rissi Palmer, charting with the singles, \u201cCountry Girl,\u201d \u201cHold On To Me,\u201d and \u201cNo Air.\u201d She followed with a Christmas single, an independently released children\u2019s album, Best Day Ever, and an EP called The Back Porch Sessions.\n\nRissi has performed at The White House, Lincoln Center, and the Grand Ole Opry, has appeared on Oprah & Friends, CNN, the CBS Early Show, and the Tavis Smiley Show. She has shared stages with Taylor Swift, The Eagles, Chris Young, and Charley Crockett, and she has been featured in Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal, People, Parade, Ebony, Newsweek, and The Huffington Post", "otherInfo": "In this new normal that everyone's living in, there are still challenges for a lot of people, not least musicians and artists that rely on revenue from tours to pay bills, eat food, and keep going in their chosen profession.

Caitlyn Smith, one of Nashville's most prized writers, is one of them: and, after years spent composing songs for and with everyone from Dolly Parton to Garth Brooks to Meghan Trainor, she's finally ready to unveil all sides of her enormous talent with Starfire. Long lauded for her ability to whirl pure emotion into unforgettable tracks, Starfire is a raw, visceral journey about love, hardship and the struggle to pave your own way, all anchored by her unforgettable tone. A few minutes of listening and one thing becomes abundantly clear: there is no one better to sing the music of Caitlyn Smith than Smith herself.\n\n\"I wanted to unlock my heart and dig around inside a little,\" Smith says about the songs of Starfire, with the first five songs available now. \"And I wanted to be more vulnerable, and tell the stories I have lived. It's more of a raw process to write for myself.\"\n\nIndeed, songs like \"Before You Called Me Baby\" shake the listener to the core: blending her soulful vocals with stirring, deeply honest lyrics and instrumentation that only amplifies the organic construction, they occupy a unique space that can both blossom with a full band or be stripped down into intimate, solo experiences. Because Smith, who has toured and opened for acts such as Eric Church, Sheryl Crow and Dierks Bentley, understands not only how important the craft itself is, but also how music can \u2013 and should - transform in a live setting. With just her acoustic guitar, Smith can stun to silence.\n\nRaised in the small town of Cannon Falls, Minnesota, Smith grew up singing in the church and at county fairs \u2013 and it soon became abundantly clear that her talent stretched well beyond the ordinary. She wrote her first songs at the young age of eight, and had already convinced her parents that a career as an artist was her true path by the time she reached her teenage years. \"I released two records before I graduated high school,\" Smith recalls. \"I knew I needed to do music and nothing else.\" After a stint in Minneapolis, it was clear that Nashville was where she belonged, and she quickly became a sought-after force in the songwriting scene: so much so that even music she intended to sing herself quickly got snatched up by others, yielding her two top country hits, including the platinum \"Wasting All These Tears,\" recorded by Cassadee Pope.\n\nA celebrated force in the writer's room, Smith's also had her songs cut by Parton, Brooks and Lady Antebellum, and co-wrote Trainor's John Legend duet, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" among many others. For a while, Smith balanced her two worlds \u2013 as an artist, and a writer \u2013 while primarily focusing on the latter, working to perfect her craft and discover exactly what she wanted to say in her solo work. She released some music under her own name, but it didn't capture the spirit she ultimately wanted. \"I was shooting for something instead of singing music that was in my heart, that I loved,\" she says, as honest as ever. \"So I stepped back. I said to myself, 'the next thing that I release, I don't want to ask anybody's opinion. I want to go into the studio and make a record that I love and is true to me.'\"\n\nThat next thing became Starfire, produced by Paul Moak, who quickly became Smith's trusted collaborator. They would often bunker down at his Nashville studio, while Smith enlisted friends and colleagues for co-writes, like Gordie Sampson, Kate York and Sarah Buxton. But suddenly, some news came along: Smith was expecting a child. \"It added a beautiful layer of excitement,\" she says. \"Not only was I making a record, but I'm making a life. This little boy has been along for the ride.\"\n\nStarfire, itself, is all about growth, and what it takes to get to your most honest and true incarnation. Smith decided to trust her strengths: her soulful vocals, her strong sense of imaginative storytelling and her ability to craft melodies that exist outside of genre walls and instead focus on timelessness. But there are plenty of infectious hooks in there, too.\n\n\"We didn't want to think about genre or radio or any boundaries,\" she says. Like Chris Stapleton, Maren Morris or even Crow, she artfully blends a steady catalogue of influences and reference points, held together by stellar craft and her formidable voice. \"We wanted to make music that moved us, stay out of the way of the songs and let my voice shine through. Some songs sound more country, some sound more folk. There's a little rock and soul in there, too, which makes it a bit of a genre-less record. But it feels just right to me.\"\n\nGenreless, maybe, but full of vitality, and also downright honest. Take a song like \"This Town is Killing Me,\" about how life as an artist in Music City isn\u2019t all champagne and roses, even when there are small successes. \"It can be a such a hard, heartbreak town,\" Smith says. \"As much as you want to write those songs you know would pay the bills, if you did it every day, the artist part in you would die. There is this balance of loving this town because you get to create, but also it is just so brutal.\" Smith isn\u2019t the kind to smile and nod \u2013 instead, she turns her emotions into moments like this that manage to be about both her own experience and the human condition as a whole.\n\nAnd then there are songs like \"Tacoma,\" devastating in both its lyrics and its sheer beauty: \"I'm burning your memory one mile at a time\" Smith sings in her stunning vocal delivery to stripped-down production. Then, of course, there is the title track, which blends a pop groove with a soulful, chugging chorus. It's about how important it is to keep going even when the world wants to bring you down \u2013 an attitude that has ruled Smith's career thus far. Here, she proclaims her strength to a dynamite beat: it's one thing to have the talent to be a star, but it's another to have the will to keep your fire flaming bright.\n\n\"This whole record and process, I've been on a journey,\" she says. \u201cI've heard no many times and just kept going. I've learned that one thing is for certain: nothing is going to burn me out.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/caitlynsmith"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Frank Turner ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8521512.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Folk Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For three long and often lonely years of life on the road, plying a brand of honest and passionate folk/punk, Frank Turner continued to rise to prominence with an ever increasing following. But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar.

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic.

He has collaborated with a wide range of artists, filmmakers and legendary musicians. But it is his work as a leader that has garnered increasing attention and accolades. The New York Times described Frisell\u2019s music this way. \u201cIt's hard to find a more fruitful meditation on American music than in the compositions of guitarist Bill Frisell. Mixing rock and country with jazz and blues, he's found what connects them: improvisation and a sense of play. Unlike other pastichists, who tend to duck passion, Mr. Frisell plays up the pleasure in the music and also takes on another often-avoided subject, tenderness.\"\n\nFrisell\u2019s recordings over the last decades span a wide range of musical influences. His catalog, including over twenty recordings for Nonesuch, has been cited by Downbeat as \u201cthe best recorded output of the decade.\u201d It includes original Buster Keaton film scores to arrangements of music for extended ensemble with horns (This Land, Blues Dream); adaptations of his compositions originally written as sound-tracks to Gary Larson cartoons (Quartet); interpretations of work by other classic and contemporary American composers (Have a Little Faith) ; and collaborations with the acclaimed rhythm section of bassist Viktor Krauss and drummer Jim Keltner (Gone, Just Like a Train, Good Dog, Happy Man). Other releases include an album with Nashville musicians (Nashville), the solo album Ghost Town, an album of his arrangements of songs by Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach (The Sweetest Punch), a trio album with jazz legends Dave Holland and Elvin Jones, and a collection of American traditional songs and original compositions inspired by them entitled The Willies. The Intercontinentals, nominated for a Grammy in 2004 is an album that combines Frisell\u2019s own brand of American roots music and his unmistakable improvisational style with the influences of Brazilian, Greek, and Malian sounds. His 2004 release, entitled Unspeakable, produced by Hal Wilner, won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. East/West is a two CD set, featuring his two working trios recorded in concert on both coasts. Bill Frisell, Ron Carter, Paul Motian features two jazz legends that Bill considers among his true mentors and musical inspirations. His collaborative project Floratone (Blue Note) with drummer Matt Chamberlain and producers Lee Townsend & Tucker Martine, was described by All About Jazz as \u201ca modern masterpiece.\u201d History, Mystery was nominated for a Grammy award in Best Instrumental Jazz category, featuring an octet of strings, horns and rhythm section with some of his closest music collaborators exploring a fuller palette of compositional colors and timbres than any he has previously written for. \u201cThe whole album stands as yet another testament to the man's place at the very epicenter of modern American music.\" - BBC. The recent collection titled The Best of Bill Frisell, Vol 1: Folk Songs is the first in a series of compilations, this one drawn from Frisell's catalog spotlighting his idiosyncratic excursions into country and traditional folk. His latest album, \u201cDisfarmer\u201d, was inspired by the photographer Mike Disfarmer. It was described by the Houston Chronicle as follows: \"Frisell's pacing is magnificent, and the album sweeps along with purpose like a gorgeous, spacious epic. It is full of sounds that suggest settings and characters, including the mysterious eccentric who inspired the recording.\"\n\nBeginning in 2008, a trilogy of Frisell\u2019s music DVD\u2019s was released. First was Solos, shot in Toronto in high definition. Following in 2009, were the long awaited Films of Buster Keaton, Music By Bill Frisell featuring Frisell\u2019s original trio, Kermit Driscoll on bass and Joey Baron on drums as well as Live From Montreal, shot at the Montreal Jazz Festival in 2002 and featuring Matt Chamberlain on drums, Billy Drewes on alto saxophone, Curtis Fowlkes on trombone, Ron Miles on cornet and Greg Leisz on steel guitars. It showcases the music of Frisell\u2019s celebrated album, Blues Dream.\n\nIn 2006, Frisell was named a USA Rasmuson Fellow and became a recipient of a grant offered by United States Artists, a privately funded organization dedicated to the support of America's finest living artists.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "A.Skillz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8974191.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Bass, Mash Up, Hip Hop, Glitch Hop, Funk", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I make beats and dj.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Monstercat ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365937.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Electronic Music, Music & Concert Entertainment, Gaming, Electronic, Edm & Dance, Edm & House Music, Edm, Electronic Festivals, Music & Art Performance", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Empowering a creative and passionate community through innovation.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording.

The Selecter\u2019s Pauline Black describes The Tuts sound best: \u2018infectious guitar led pop wrapped around fiery drums, sharp tongues and splendid harmonies\u2019. Founding members, Nadia Javed (guitar/lead vox) and Beverley Ishmael (drums) recruited Harriet Doveton (bass/vox) in 2011. The following year they were spotted by Kate Nash and supported her UK and European tours, building up their fan base of \u2018Tutters\u2019 wherever they went. Kate Nash raved \u2018they are currently the best UK band I\u2019ve seen live in a really long time\u2019. These tours were notably an all-female rock experience that celebrated feminism in the unapologetic 1990s \u2018Riot Grrrl\u2019 tradition.

The effervescent appeal of Nadia\u2019s irreverent stage persona and, as Billy himself called it, the \u2018fabulous cacophony\u2019 these three women conjure up every time they play makes for an unforgettable live experience. Pauline Black was in the crowd and soon after The Tuts joined The Selecter on their 2015 UK tour.

Studio album No.6 - \u2018WAX\u2019 - the 2nd in a trilogy, out now.\n\nSince scoring a worldwide smash with her debut album \u2018Eye To The Telescope\u2019 in 2004, which went on to sell over 5 million copies, KT Tunstall has remained at the forefront of UK singer- songwriter talent. Over the next decade, three further critically acclaimed albums followed; \u2018Drastic Fantastic\u2019, \u2018Tiger Suit\u2019 and \u2018Invisible Empire//Crescent Moon\u2019 in 2007, 2010 and 2013 respectively, keeping the platinum sales rolling and cementing the Scottish singer-songwriter\u2019s reputation as a major recording talent, as well as a mesmerising live artist.\n\nTunstall has toured the world many times over. She outsold every other female artist in the UK in 2005, won the 2006 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, won the Ivor Novello Best Song award for her huge, self-penned hit 'Suddenly I See\u2019, and a Q award for Track of the Year. She also landed a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and lent her tunes to a host of movies and TV shows ('Suddenly I See', used in the iconic opening scene of Meryl Streep flick 'The Devil Wears Prada').\n\n2012 and the years that followed saw a seismic shift in outlook - the loss of her father, a divorce, and a relocation to Venice Beach, California.\n\nAfter a period of healing, soul-searching, and a change of scenery, 2016 hailed the arrival of the first of a trilogy of albums, the critically acclaimed UK top 10 album - 'KIN'. The trilogy evokes, separately and in sequence, spirit, body and mind. With 'KIN' being her phoenix- from-the-ashes 'spirit' album, 2018 marked the second offering of that trilogy, the \u2018body\u2019 album \u2018WAX\u2019 - released October 5th.\n\nSpeaking about her 6th studio album, Tunstall says of \u2018WAX\u2019 \u201cI knew before I started writing that I wanted it to be an electric guitar record. It had to be visceral, about the physical, and the weight of that, and the obstacles of that. It\u2019s a record about human-ness, which we so often just write off as \u2018flaws\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe title a nod to the viscous pungency of one of the body\u2019s natural substances. \u201cWax evokes colonies of bees, candlelight, the material that the first long-playing records were made of\u201d, she explains, \u201cbut more than that, wax is produced inside your own head. You unconsciously create it, and then weirdly that same basic substance has been used for centuries to make the most lifelike replicas of human beings. It has a life glow to it. It sticks to you. We have these strange, ancient connections and relationships with wax. How odd is it that the body produces all these substances from all these holes!\u201d laughs this stoutly down-to-earth singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nLead single \u201cThe River\u201d, which was released August 23rd, opens with an arresting synth hook, before Tunstall\u2019s powerful voice enters, emotionally taking centre stage. The track builds with strong rhythmic guitar textures, exploding into an anthemic chorus. Heavy guitar riffs are central to this track capturing the dirt, grit and physicality of the album. Tunstall explains, \u201cit\u2019s about wanting to escape the madness in the world, escaping bad relationships, and wanting to be washed clean - emancipation through nature\u201d. The single was named one of Rolling Stone's \u2018Songs You Need To Know\u2019. The music video, directed by Alexo Wandael, premiered on Clash Magazine and features KT performing a sensual routine with dancer Alex Thomas.\n\nKT released \u2018WAX\u2019 in October 2018 via Virgin Records (UK) / Rostrum Records/ InGrooves (US / RoW). \u201cWAX\u201d entered the UK album chart at number 15 (Tunstall\u2019s 6th Top 20 album in the UK), was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018New Music Friday\u2019 playlist in a dozen countries worldwide and received critical acclaim from both national publications and specialist music outlets in both the UK and USA.\n\nThe Sunday Times - \u201cKiller folk-rock melodies and chord progressions; lyrics rich with emotional intelligence, candour, self-awareness and bite and vocals of immediacy\u201d\n\nThe I \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment she strikes the first meaty chord of her new album, KT sounds visceral capturing the grit of her live shows\u201d\n\nThe Sun 4* \u2013 \u201cWAX provides a gritty collection of classic rock-pop\u201d\n\nSecond single, \u2018Human Being\u2019, was released in December 2018, accompanied by a self- directed video by Tunstall which was premiered on NYLON and features an 8-year-old black belt nunchuck talent Eccaia Sampson. KT says of the video: \u201cMy vision for the video was to create a mirror between a young, crazy- talented, bold little girl, and link that burgeoning energy to a band of warrioress women\u201d. The track was playlisted by BBC Radio 2.\n\nThe last few years have seen something of a creative rebirth for Tunstall. Upon relocating to the west coast of the USA, she was accepted as one of six annual fellows for the Sundance Film Institute\u2019s Composers Lab (hosted by George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch in Northern California) and has since scored music for short and feature films.\nShe has also been awarded the Inspirational Artist gong at the Women In Music Awards and was chosen as the first ever female Grand Marshal (following the likes of Sir Sean Connery) to lead April 2018\u2019s annual New York Tartan Week parade. In May 2018 she and Mike McCready, of legendary multi-million selling Pearl Jam, released a cover of Tom Petty\u2019s huge hit single \u2018I Won\u2019t Back Down\u2019 with proceeds going to Pearl Jam\u2019s Vitalogy Foundation.\n\nIn 2018, KT performed sold-out intimate headline shows across the UK and US and toured worldwide supporting acclaimed artists including Simple Minds, The Pretenders, Barenaked Ladies and Gary Barlow.\n\nSo far in 2019, KT has been on a headline tour across the UK and Europe with her all-female band, played at festivals all over the UK (including a headline set at Glastonbury and sets at Isle of Wight, HebCelt, Larmer Tree and Car Fest), toured across the US & Canada, supported Hall & Oates on their UK arena tour and played shows in Japan and China.\n\nBy the end of 2019, KT will have also played live dates in the Netherlands, Mexico and Brazil.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dark Arps ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Welcome to the Audioship"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sondre Lerche ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9112753.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Pop, Indie, Alternative, Songwriter, Singer, Folk", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sondre is a Los Angeles-based Norwegian singer, songwriter, film score composer and artist.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mannequin Pussy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9164830.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Alternative, Punk, Indie, Rock", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Mannequin Pussy\u2019s new album 'Patience' is out now on Epitaph Records. Purchase & Stream at https://mannequinpussy.ffm.to/patience.\n\nThe third full-length from Mannequin Pussy, Patience is an album fascinated with the physical experience of the body, its songs tracking the movements of mouths and hands and racing hearts, skin and spit and teeth and blood. Deeply attuned to the power of their own physicality, the Philadelphia-based band channels complex emotion in blistering riffs, thrashing rhythms, vocals that feel as immediate and untamed as a gut reaction. But throughout Patience, the Philadelphia-based band contrasts that raw vitality with intricate melodies and finely detailed arrangements, building a strange and potent tension that makes the album all the more cathartic.\n\nThe follow-up to Romantic\u2014a 2016 release praised by Pitchfork for \u201ccombin[ing] punk, shoegaze, death metal, and more, with the ferocious push-pull energy of a mosh pit\u201d\u2014Patience came to life at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. In creating the album, Mannequin Pussy worked with producer/engineer Will Yip (Quicksand, The Menzingers), shaping an explosive sound that never overshadows the subtlety of their songwriting. \u201cIn the past there\u2019s been a chaotic feeling to the recording process, but working with Will put us in a different headspace,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cIt helped us show our progression over the past few years and make a very crisp-sounding record, without losing the dirtiness of what Mannequin Pussy really is.\u201d\n\nOpening with its gloriously frenetic title track, Patience matches Mannequin Pussy\u2019s wild volatility with a narrative voice that\u2019s often painfully vulnerable. On \u201cDrunk II,\u201d for instance, Dabice\u2019s vocals shift from fragile to furious, the track\u2019s stormy guitar work colliding with lyrics capturing the grief of post-breakup inertia. \u201cI wrote that song one night when I was very heartbroken, after I\u2019d been out with friends trying to pretend like I wasn\u2019t feeling so hopeless,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cI went home and just started playing guitar and crying, and stayed up working on that song till about four in the morning.\u201d\n\nOn the delicately sprawling \u201cHigh Horse,\u201d Patience takes on a more restrained tone but still maintains a devastating intensity, with Mannequin Pussy presenting an intimate portrait of an abusive relationship (\u201cPushing me up against the kitchen sink/I feel your breath on me/I can taste it in my teeth\u201d). Meanwhile, \u201cWho You Are\u201d shifts into a brightly tender mood, assuming a classic-love-song sweetness in its message of self-acceptance. \u201cI turned 30 as we were working on the record, and it changed my whole perspective on my life and relationships and everything,\u201d says Dabice. \u201c\u2018Who You Are\u2019 came from thinking about what I\u2019d want to say to myself when I was still in my 20s and wasting so much time not believing in myself.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Patience, Mannequin Pussy transmit an unstoppable fury: the 39-second \u201cClams\u201d delivers as a brutal blast of vitriol against those who\u2019ve tried to hold them back, while \u201cF.U.C.A.W.\u201d unfolds in unhinged riffs and relentlessly pounding beats. And on \u201cIn Love Again,\u201d the album closes out with a magnificently epic anthem driven by dreamy guitar tones, lilting piano melodies, and a particularly elegant performance from Reading (\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the nuanced drum beat and the percussion odyssey at the end,\u201d she notes. \u201cAnd yes, there are bongos on the track\u201d). The most undeniably hopeful moment on Patience, \u201cIn Love Again\u201d telegraphs utter joy and awe in its heart-on-sleeve lyrics. \u201cI always want our records to end in a place of optimism,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cThe songs take you on a journey through all these very toxic emotions and traumatic experiences, but what I\u2019m trying to articulate is that something good can come from getting through all that.\u201d\n\nThe push toward transformation has long propelled the songwriting of Mannequin Pussy, who formed as a duo when childhood friends Dabice and Paul reconnected after years apart. At the time, Dabice had recently returned to the East Coast from Colorado in order to help take care of her mother, who\u2019d just suffered a stroke. \u201cIt was one of the most trying times of my life, and at some point my mom suggested that I try going to therapy,\u201d Dabice recalls. \u201cBut instead I was like, \u2018I think I\u2019m just gonna learn to play guitar.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone; I just wanted to lose myself in the creative process.\u201d Once she and Paul played music together, they discovered a chemistry she now describes as magical. \u201cWe created so much in such a short period of time,\u201d Dabice says. \u201cWe never even thought of making records or anything\u2014it was just this pure emotional outlet, just us screaming onstage with our guitars.\u201d\n\nAs they continued collaborating, Dabice and Paul later added Reading and Regisford to the lineup, making their debut with GP in 2014 and releasing Romantic in fall 2016. Recently signed to Epitaph, Mannequin Pussy found themselves newly revitalized in the writing and recording of Patience, their creative connection stronger than ever. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of how hard we\u2019ve worked to get to this point,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cThis album sounds exactly how I\u2019ve always wanted us to sound\u2014I\u2019ve never listened to something we\u2019ve made and felt so inspired by it.\u201d\n\nAs Dabice explains, the band\u2019s journey toward the making of Patience partly inspired the album\u2019s title. \u201cI think you have to be patient that you\u2019ll find the sound that\u2019s in your head,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to take your time if you can\u2019t figure it out right away\u2014you\u2019ve got to just trust that you\u2019ll get there eventually.\u201d And within that process, Mannequin Pussy have continually found the emotional release that ultimately makes their music so powerful. \u201cFeeling isolated in your most toxic experiences can slowly destroy you from the inside, but going through the motion of creating something can make you feel at peace,\u201d Dabice says. \u201cAnd the real beauty is that, by sharing your experience, it helps other people to feel less alone as well. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always searched for with our music, and I don\u2019t think that will ever change for us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/girlgangleeds"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Peter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6342988.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "1.)

And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear.

Taylor Powell had this to say about the new record:\n\n\u201cHurricane Harvey definitely changed a lot of things for us,\u201d explains Taylor Powell. \u201cThe plans we had been making for the previous few months were completely wiped out. As we were tearing down our childhood home, there were definitely many moments of despair. But as they say, when you are going through hell, keep on going.

They\u2019re here to tear you away from the soul-sucking sanctity of your dumpster-fire life and replace it with pop-blessed punk jams about navigating the impending doom of adulthood when all you want is to have ice cream on your birthday.\n\nAlex Luciano (guitar and vocals) and Noah Bowman (drums) have been playing music together ever since Luciano interrupted the set of Bowman's previous band for a lighter. The New York duo have since released the infectious, 2015 \u2018Over Easy\u2019 EP that introduced consistent sing-a-long lyrics with thrashing drums and strums that never held back.\n\n\u2018Swear I\u2019m Good At This\u2019 is the first full-length from the band and accumulates their tenacity for crafting life-affirming, relatable tales with a gutsy heart at their core. Luciano has the ability to write lyrics that are both vulnerable and badass, perfecting a storm of emotive reflection that creates a vision of a sweaty, pumped-up room screaming these lines in unison.

On their fourth studio album Everything Seems Like Yesterday, the San Diego-based band twist that dynamic to deliver their most emotionally direct body of work to date: a collection of songs written and performed solely by Carnevale, each track matching its stripped-back simplicity with both raw outpouring and intense reflection.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2019 album Live at the Observatory, Everything Seems Like Yesterday first took shape through a handful of songs Carnevale wrote on acoustic guitar back in fall 2018. \u201cHypochondriac was the first time I\u2019d ever written that way, and it felt really therapeutic,\u201d he says, referring to the band\u2019s 2018 Epitaph debut. \u201cIt pushed me to get much more into the craft of songwriting\u2014as opposed to mostly writing songs for people to mosh to\u2014and it felt right to keep going with that on this record.\u201d\n\nAlthough he originally intended to release that acoustic material as a solo album, Carnevale had a change of heart upon sharing his new songs at a series of shows in San Diego and L.A. \u201cAll the guys in the band came out and the response was pretty positive, so I started to think this might be something more than a bunch of songs to put online for free,\u201d he says. Envisioning the album as a natural evolution for The Frights, Carnevale soon enlisted Dotson as a producer, and the two bandmates set off to record at Carnevale\u2019s grandmother\u2019s cabin in Idyllwild, California.\n\nKicking off with the sweetly offbeat folk of \u201c24,\u201d Everything Seems Like Yesterday documents a particularly challenging year of Carnevale\u2019s life\u2014a period that began with the release of Hypochondriac on August 24, 2018 (i.e., Carnevale\u2019s 24th birthday). \u201cA lot of these songs are about friends who are gone now, either in the sense that they passed away or that we don\u2019t speak anymore,\u201d Carnevale points out. \u201cOur songs have always involved some kind of looking back over the past, but this one feels like the first time where I\u2019m dealing with those situations and growing from them. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s more mature\u2014because I don\u2019t know if I actually am more mature\u2014but it feels a little healthier than the songs where I\u2019m more caught up in nostalgia, and wishing things could just go back to the way they used to be.\u201d\n\nDuring their time at the Idyllwild cabin\u2014a free-flowing but rigorously productive week in late-April 2019\u2014Carnevale and Dotson purposely laid down the entire tracklist to Everything Seems Like Yesterday in exact sequence. In that process, they eschewed all digital production methods in favor of using a field recorder to capture a wide array of ambient sounds. \u201cThere were no plugins on the whole record; we wanted to force ourselves to be as creative as we could,\u201d Carnevale says. To that end, the two musicians ended up relying on everything from pinecones to pots and pans to construct the album\u2019s percussive components, in addition to introducing such sonic elements as the crunching of fallen leaves and the thump of tennis ball thrown against the cabin wall. And while recording the beautifully untethered \u201cSimple and Strange,\u201d Carnevale found his performance disrupted by an incoming call on the cabin landline\u2014then left that ringing in the track\u2019s final version. (\u201cEvery time I go up to Idyllwild my dad will always call to fuck with me\u2014like, \u2018I\u2019m watching you\u2026\u2019, so we just figured it was him,\u201d Carnevale recalls. \u201cBut when we picked up the phone during that take no one was there, and we never actually figured out who was calling.\u201d)\n\nWith recording in sequence giving Carnevale the motivation to \u201cmake each song better than the last,\u201d Everything Seems Like Yesterday ends on the heavy-hearted but hopeful \u201c25\u201d: a harmonica-laced number whose distinctly lo-fi aesthetic stems from some trickery on Dotson\u2019s part. \u201cWhen I was done writing that one I told Richard to come listen, and without telling me he turned on the field recorder\u2014and that\u2019s the take we ended up going with,\u201d says Carnevale. \u201cSo what you\u2019re hearing on the album is the first time I ever even played that song out loud.\u201d\n\nIn creating the more starkly composed songs heard throughout Everything Seems Like Yesterday, Carnevale made a point of placing a more careful focus on his lyrics, partly drawing from his burgeoning love of poets like Allen Ginsberg, Charles Bukowski, and Sylvia Plath. \u201cIf you can read a song as a poem and still get the same feeling from it, you know you\u2019ve done something right,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have plenty of songs from the old days that would really lack something if you took away the music and the melody, but these new songs feel more connected to when I first started writing\u2014back before the main concern was mostly just trying to get people to dance.\u201d\n\nAs they gear up for the release of Everything Seems Like Yesterday, The Frights are building up the album\u2019s tracks in order to accommodate the unhinged energy of their live performance. But for Carnevale, the album will always maintain an undeniable intimacy. \u201cWhen this was going to be a solo record, I had it in the back of my mind that it would really just be for my friends and my family,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd to be completely honest, that\u2019s still 100 percent what I want from this album. There\u2019s a lot of stuff on there that\u2019s about things that people close to me have gone through, and in a way the songs are just me trying to talk through them, and get a very personal message across without really worrying about anything else.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Featuring artists from their 2020 SXSW lineup, Dr. Martens is swapping the physical stage for the virtual one to bring fans a fun Instagram Live set with San Diego's punk rockers The Frights!

The way their voices blend together in song conjures an imagined romance, much like their own. Before they met, Benjamin and Mia worked hard at their craft but each felt separately, something was missing. Their first songwriting session together, in 2004, led to the discovery that what they were missing was each other. Fast forward to today, they have now released five studio albums, one live album, were named semi-finalists at the 2018 International Songwriting Competition, and were nominated at the 2018 International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nTheir most recent project, \u201cLive at Home\u201d was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, at a house concert in Azalea\u2019s living room. The recording captures the acoustic heart and soul of six songs from their 2017 studio release, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, two new original songs, and a cover of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d, from the motion picture \u201cOnce\u201d. Tickets were sold as a crowdfunding perk to help raise funds to record the aforementioned studio release.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was released on October 13, 2017 and was supported by a multi-province 2 week tour. Written and recorded in their home studio, this project features love songs, beautiful vocal harmony and showcases Benjamin & Mia\u2019s musical abilities. The album sits comfortably in the \u201cContemporary Roots\u201d genre featuring songs that borrow from North American and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as conventional pop sensibilities.\n\n\u201cI See The Church\u201d from the album \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was nominated at the 2018 IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) in the \u201cBest Group/Duo\u201d category .\n\nHamilton Blues Lovers Blog has this to say about the album,\n\n\u201cHamilton musical duo, Azalea keeps growing with every recording and their latest, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d proves it. The production is amazing and they\u2019ve created a fabulous melding of pop and roots music. Their lush vocal harmonies flow through the entire album as the sometimes infectious and always beautiful melodies bolster the sound. It\u2019s a perfect mix of vocals and music that can\u2019t help but effect you emotionally\u2026\u201d\n\nIn May 2015 Azalea was hand picked by GigSalad & CD Baby to play their junket for Canadian Music Week in Toronto, Ontario. In honour of this occasion, Azalea recorded and released a limited edition EP called \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d. As a salute to GigSalad & CD Baby\u2019s DIY methodology, \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d was made completely in house with fabric bound hand packaging.\n\nIn 2013, Azalea released the EP \"Inside Out\". An album which streamlined their folk- tinged pop sound and showcased songs to tug at the heart strings with haunting melodic and harmonic lines. Reminiscent of The Civil Wars, and Fleetwood Mac \u201cInside Out\u201d shed light on Azalea\u2019s Alt-Country side. The pitch for its successful crowd- funding campaign gave some insight into their work:\n\n\". . . it has always been our goal to release quality music that is culturally relevant and speaks to the heart. . . . However, we wanted to take listeners on a journey beyond the routine of everyday life to the place that connects them with their emotions, beliefs, and values in a real way.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012 Azalea released \u201cAt the End of This Year...\u201d, their seasonal single which has received the nod of approval from CBC radio.\n\nAzalea\u2019s 2010 release, \u201cCoffee & Kisses EP\", was among the top three finalists for Recording of the Year, Rock Recording of the Year, Instrumentalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the 2010 Durham Region Music Awards. The album was featured in prominent music magazines and generated good response from college radio across Ontario.\n\nYears before anyone knew Benjamin & Mia Hackett as Azalea, they performed, travelled, and recorded an album as Benjamin & Mia. \u201cThe Carousel of Life\u201d (2007) is the root of their love for each other and for their musical life together. That first album thrust them into the life they know, love, and hope to express in song, to every listener.\n\nAzalea\u2019s chemistry is undeniable - their stage presence magnetic! To experience Azalea in concert is to be invited into their love story. They will will draw you in and pull on your hearts strings. Azalea will take you on an emotional rollercoaster as they move through their repertoire of simple & sweet love songs, then take you south with swampy tunes which are full of rich vocal harmony and live looping. Two complementary voices supported by guitar, piano, \"suitcase-kick-drum\u201d, and foot tambourine create a breathtaking concert experience.\n\nA must see for fans of \u201cFleetwood Mac\u201d, \u201dThe Civil Wars\u201d, and the film \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d.\n\nAzalea is currently performing on board cruise ships around the world.

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bill Toms ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9217124.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cBill Toms is a poet, a soul-shouter and guitar slinger with one foot in the gutter and an eye on the heavens above.

The Pittsburgh native, along with his band Hard Rain, delivers a sound that takes the greatest of America\u2019s most beloved genres and melds them into a poetic representation of the best the country has to offer.\n\nWith his ninth full-length studio release, Good For My Soul (street date October 27), Toms channels a foot-stomping, wall-shaking blend of soul, blues, gospel, and rock vibes, all brought together with his lyrical specialty -- stories of everyday men and women doing their best to stay ahead while still managing to keep a dream or two in their heads.\n\nSoaring horns, gritty licks, toe-tapping rhythms, and Toms\u2019 own rough-hewn vocals will draw listeners in, as well as well-deserved comparisons to the greats such as Dr. John, Little Feat, Springsteen, Joe Tex, The Blasters, Otis Redding, and Rufus Thomas.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a horn section behind my songs has been something I\u2019ve thought about for a while,\u201d explains Toms. \u201cAlbert King, and all the Stax artists come to mind when I think of what true rhythm and blues can do. I wanted a piece of that; creating dynamics, and drama within the song; and fostering the deep emotion that a great horn section can give. The words also needed this place-- in order to be fully interpreted as the representation of \u2018my America,\u2019 and the people who make up my small part of this world.\u201d\n\nGood For My Soul was recorded in February 2017 by Oscar-winning composer Rick Witkowski, who also co-produced the set with Will Kimbrough (Rodney Crowell, Todd Snider). Both artists have collaborated with Toms frequently on parts of his earlier catalog.\n\nToms launched his musical career in 1987 as lead guitarist of Pittsburgh\u2019s legendary band Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers, During that period, he opened for and played with such legendary names as The Band, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Little Feat, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. While playing guitar, co-writing, and adding backup vocals for the Houserockers, Toms and the band recorded six studio albums and one live concert album. In 1995, The Houserockers released American Babylon, which was recorded and produced by Springsteen himself.\n\nAs a solo artist, Toms has opened for the likes of Buddy Guy, Levon Helm, Marshall Crenshaw, The Kennedys, Steve Forbert, and Ellis Paul. He\u2019s plotting a string of regional east coast dates to support Good For My Soul, as well as a full European tour in 2018.\nFor more information and tour dates, please visit www.billtoms.com", "otherInfo": "Blues Society Of Western Pennsylvania Presents Bill Toms Live Stream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Palaver Strings ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9901957.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Palaver has always played chamber music in unusual spaces, from impossibly-small living rooms to abandoned warehouses.

A half-hour later, he called back to change it to Won-Ton Haggis. But neither sounded right, and Enter the Haggis seemed to flow.\n\n\"It's like Enter the Dragon, but a lot messier,\" said Downie. \"It ended up sticking ... but it's not the sort of name we expected to go with.\"\n\nDownie -- a native of Glasgow, Scotland, expatriated to Ontario with his parents at age 7 -- enjoys a good haggis \"if it's cooked properly. If I had a couple of pints first, it's even better.\"\n\nHaggis, for those not in the know, is a traditional Scottish dish made of minced sheep's innards, oatmeal and a varied assortment of other ingredients. Enter the Haggis, on the other hand, is an energetic Celtic rock band from Toronto.\n\nDownie, pulled from a Toronto recording studio for this interview, is the band's founder, primary kilt-wearer, singer, bagpiper and chief songwriter. He has a penchant for inserting odd imagery into his music.\n\nSongs on the band's first album, Let the Wind Blow High, deal with the likes of Scottish-Mexican brawlers, bagpipers in space and \"loch monsters\" of a different sort.\n\n\"I came from Scotland as a kid,\" Downie said, as if that explains everything. Since it didn't, he continued. \"I wanted to know more about my culture, but most of what I could find out was the Hollywood version of Scotland,\" he explained. \"I watched Brigadoon and things like that, which portrayed Scotland in a comical light. ... I thought, 'There's a lot of comedy coming out of Scotland.' So I started putting it together.\"\n\nHe finds ideas for songwriting in various places, from a Mexican native with a Scottish education and accent to headlines about Lorena Bobbit's exercise in extreme circumcision.\n\nDownie is by no means a traditional piper, either, drawing on a variety of musical styles to create his own unique sound.\n\n\"I'd like to think of myself as an entertaining pipe player more than anything else,\" he said. \"If I can get a different sound out of my pipes and keep people interested -- that's my job and that's my hobby.\"\n\nDownie, who recently delayed recording to get married, buy a house and go on tour, said he finds musical inspiration in everything from early Beatles and Led Zeppelin to the pibroch, the classical music of the Highland pipe.\n\n\"The pipes were the first rock 'n' roll instrument,\" he insisted. \"With what other instrument can you get up and cut a swath through a room of 200 people?\"\n\nBesides Downie, Enter the Haggis is Trevor Lewington (electric and acoustic guitars), James \"Seumas\" Campbell (drums), Brian Buchanan (fiddle) and Mark Abraham (bass). The band, with its second album in the works, is hoping to help bands like Seven Nations spread Celtic \"bagpipe rock\" to the masses.\n\n\"I would like to see Celtic rock become a dominant force in music,\" Downie said. \"Rock music has really become kind of homogenous. I don't know where it's going to go these days. You turn on the radio and one song sounds like the next. \"I would like to take Celtic rock to its epitome.\"\n\nThe band's evolution is already underway, he noted. \"We're a tighter band than we were before -- just from doing a lot more playing. Our sound has become a bit more dynamic,\" Downie said.\n\n\"It's got a bit more of an electric feel to it for sure. We're trying to get a bit more power into it,\" he added. \"It's 'more good.'\"\n\nThe band's biggest joy comes from live performances, jamming on-stage with a jammin' mix of traditional tunes, original material and plenty of humor. While they once bribed audiences with T-shirts and CDs to get them up and moving, that no longer seems to be a problem.\n\n\"We played recently at the Mosiac Festival out in Regina,\" Downie recalled. \"The stage was swarmed by about 200 people. ... Nobody got hurt or killed or anything, so I guess it was a good show.\n\n\"Of course, there's always a potential for mishaps. Last week, an older gentleman leapt up on stage, embraced our guitarist and kissed him. That was a bit weird.\"", "otherInfo": "We're gonna party like it's 2004.\n\nJoin us (and our old friend James Campbell) for a deep dive into the album that introduced ETH classics like Gasoline and Down With The Ship.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

And he\u2019s got the bullet scars to prove it. The Alaska native who came of age in Shreveport, Louisiana, sings his confessional, soul-baring songs with deep conviction. Smalley expresses a fresh take on Country music that knows tradition, inspired by the greats of the genre and infused with the swampy sounds of his roots, the Gospel of hardwood church pews, and the impassioned delivery of R&B. Artists like Merle Haggard, Ray Charles, Al Green, and Willie Nelson provided a musical roadmap for Smalley to follow, and the against-the-grain success of Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell, and Sturgill Simpson drew him to Nashville. There, he began working with producer Keith Stegall, known for his award-winning work with the likes of Alan Jackson and Zac Brown Band. Ashley McBryde and Dillon Carmichael already have picked up on Smalley\u2019s writing ability, including his songs on their recent albums, and joins her on the road for select dates this Spring. Smalley has also joined bills alongside Nelson, Tim McGraw, Justin Moore, and Dwight Yoakam.

He has been on the road since 2013, performing more than one thousand shows across the United States. His live performances draw from his own discography as well as an extensive collection of folk, bluegrass, and gospel songs and select tracks from his favorite classic and contemporary songwriters. The necessity of travelling and performing solo has informed the development of Ryan\u2019s musical and songwriting style. Jordan Lawrence, writer for Free Times in Columbia SC called his arrangements \u201cdelicate but sweeping, making for a remarkably cohesive collection littered with stunners that rival many of indie folk\u2019s biggest names.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in South Carolina, Hutchens had been exposed from an early age to southern appalachian traditional music in the bluegrass, folk, and gospel genres as well as to styles ranging from classical orchestral to Nat King Cole to Nirvana. Family members played guitar and banjo and Ryan picked up guitar in his early teens but didn\u2019t consider it a serious calling for another decade. In 2010 Ryan began experimenting with songwriting and self recording, focusing on sparse guitar and vocal tracks combined with keyboards and synthesizers. In 2011, he became a founding artist of the newly formed Post Echo Media Label and started crafting a plethora of songs under his Grandfather\u2019s surname turned band name, \u201cCancellieri\u201d. As years passed and his musical experiences and interests grew, Ryan found that the honest root of what he wanted to do with music was best found in live performances and better executed with more traditional instrumentation.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2015, Hutchens released six albums under the Cancellieri name. Early Spring released in 2011; Bad Hands released in 2012; III released in 2013; Welcome To Mount Pleasant released in 2014; Closet Songs: A Collection Of Demos And Covers released in 2014; 46 And Raleigh released in 2015. Generally speaking, each album saw Hutchens progressing further away from his electronic and experimental musical beginnings, and closer to what he was doing at his live performances. The last two of these albums (Closet Songs and 46 And Raleigh) include original music but are predominantly based around Ryan\u2019s live performance covers of American traditional, gospel, bluegrass, and folk songs. In January of 2016, Ryan dropped the \u201cCancellieri\u201d moniker in favor of his real name. The name change facilitated his career shift from bedroom electronic song sculptor to touring singer songwriter and live performer. As part of this transition, a \u201cbest of\u201d album was released in September 2016 under the name Ryan Hutchens. This album is fittingly called Collection and features previously recorded and newly remastered tracks from the 2013 album III and the 2014 album Welcome To Mount Pleasant. Ryan followed up that release with his second original album, The Last Ten Years. The Last Ten Years was recorded at Archer Avenue Studio in Columbia South Carolina during the Summer of 2017 and independently released on October 13, 2017. Five years after beginning his never ending tour, he looks forward to continuing to create new music and to bringing his live performances to people around the world.", "otherInfo": "Ryan Hutchens will perform a live concert from his basement studio in Denver Colorado on Thursday May 7!

Said lead singer Zack Kibodeaux, \u201cWe wrote this as a band, and we wanted to tap into the feeling of that special friendship where you know you can count on one another. Even though I wrote characters that are not the band members, our relationship definitely informed the writing of the lyrics.\u201d\n\nBlue Water Highway was started by two best friends from high school- Kibodeaux (lead vocals/guitar) and Greg Essington (vocals/guitar). Zack then turned to Catherine Clarke (vocals/keyboard), to complete the three-part harmonies that the band would soon to be known for, and they were joined by Kyle Smith (bass), and Jared Wilson (drums).

After seeing Doc Watson on TV, he became a lifelong devotee of old time and bluegrass music.\n\nHe started making his living as a musician at age 19 in Chicago and in Jackson, Wyoming, eventually relocating to Boulder, Colorado in the fall of 1974. O\u2019Brien found work there as a fiddler with local bluegrass bands and as a member of the Ophelia Swing, recording with them and with Pete Wernick in 1977. In those early Colorado years, he started playing the mandolin, and studied guitar and music theory with local jazz great Dale Bruning.\n\nIn 1978, Tim co-founded the bluegrass group Hot Rize with Pete Wernick, Charles Sawtelle, and Nick Forster. Hot Rize and Western Swing alter-egos Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers eventually recorded ten albums and toured the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia. The group was named Entertainer of the Year 1990 by the International Bluegrass Music Association, and their \"Colleen Malone\" was named IBMA\u2019s Song of the Year in 1991. He won IBMA\u2019s Male Vocalist of the year in 1993, and again in 2005, when he also won song of the year for \"Look Down That Lonesome Road\".\n\nSolo recordings started with 1982\u2019s \"Hard Year Blues\", and other projects included three duet albums with his sister Mollie O\u2019Brien. Folks in Nashville started noticing Tim\u2019s songs, and he had top ten country hits in 1989 and 1990 with Kathy Mattea\u2019s versions of Hot Rize songs \"Walk The Way The Wind Blows\" and \"Untold Stories\". Other notable covers by New Grass Revival, Nickel Creek, Garth Brooks, and the Dixie Chicks followed. Hot Rize went dormant in the spring of 1990, after which O\u2019Brien performed and recorded on his own, eventually releasing fourteen solo recordings, as well as collaborations with Dirk Powell (\"Songs From The Mountain\") and with Darrell Scott (\"Real Time\"). Landmarks solo releases include a Grammy nominated set of bluegrass Dylan covers \u2013 \"Red On Blonde\", the Celtic/Appalachian fusion of \"The Crossing\", and 2005\u2019s Grammy winning \"Fiddler\u2019s Green\".\n\nTim toured and recorded with Steve Earle\u2019s Bluegrass Dukes in the early 2000\u2019s, and with Mark Knopfler in 2009 and 2010. Other recent collaborations include another CD with Darrell Scott (\"Memories and Moments\"), a track with Steve Martin (\"Daddy Played The Banjo\"), a family band set of Roger Miller songs (\"Reincarnation\"), and the reunited Hot Rize\u2019s \"When I\u2019m Free\". A collaboration with Jerry Douglas, Shawn Camp and others -\"The Earls Of Leicester\" - won a Grammy as well as IBMA\u2019s Record of the Year in 2015.\n\nTim has produced recordings for Laurie Lewis, the Yonder Mountain String Band, the Infamous Stringdusters, Old Man Luedecke, and early mentor J.D. Hutchison. He has recorded and performed with The Chieftains, Joan Baez, Dierks Bentley, Bill Frisell, and the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra. He contributed to the movie soundtrack of \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" as well as those of \"Cold Mountain\", and \"The Blob\". He is a former president of the International Bluegrass Music Association, and currently serves on the board of the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame. O\u2019Brien formed his own record label, Howdy Skies Records, in 1999, and in 2015 launched the digital download label Short Order Sessions (SOS) with his partner Jan Fabricius. SOS releases a new track every month. He has two sons, Jackson and Joel , and has lived in Nashville since 1996. Hobbies include cooking, skiing, and playing traditional Irish music.\n\nTim's latest release, 2017's \"Where the River Meets the Road, is O'Brien's 16th solo recording.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ron Gallo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8914850.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Ron Gallo", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba", "otherInfo": "i'm anxious to share new music and releasing things is always a drawn out process, so hosting this provate listening party to share unreleased music both new/old with conversation during and after."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Erick Baker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10364450.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Country, Singer Songwriter, Americana, Acoustic - Rock, Country & Folk, Acoustic & Acoustic Rock, Folk, Folk Acoustic Rock, Acoustic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Midnight To The Morning Light...I didn\u2019t grow up singing or playing music. I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

Timeless and timely, it's a classic sound with every word sang from the heart, driven forward by a mix of southern storytelling, Bible Belt twang, and Owens' big, booming baritone.\n\nFresh out of the studio, Owens has just finished recording his latest album due to release at year\u2019s end. He traveled to Texas for this project to record in The Panhandle House Studio enlisting the talents of JT Corenflos | Electric Guitar ( Alan Jackson, George Jones, Charley Pride, George Strait), Mitchell Smithey | Steele Guitar (Ray Price, Lee Ann Rimes, TG Sheppard, Gary Stuart), Dale Morris Jr. | Fiddle (Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Ray Price, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt), Kerry Huckaba | Bass Guitar (The Hansons, The White River Band), Jay Brown | Piano (Canyon, Ty Herndon), and Andrew Raley | Drums (Deryl Dodd). Together, they captured a sound filled with fiddle, pedal steel and all the hallmarks of classic country music. Ten of the eleven tracks are penned by veteran writer Galen Griffin (Luke Bryan, Joe Diffie, Craig Morgan, Clay Walker) and magically Engineered and Produced by Nick \u201cAce\u201d Lutz (David Alan Coe, Ty Herndon, Little Texas, Ronnie Milsap, Kellie Pickler). This is an album filled with music intended to take the listener back to an earlier era in Country Music reminiscent of a simpler time. Owens shines brightly delivering each song with the same supersized voice that once shook the pews of his hometown church as the musicians expertly lay the sounds of Dance Halls long gone.\n\nLong before he hand-built his career in the honky-tonks and country clubs of the southeast, Owens grew up in rural Alabama. In many ways, it was a classic American upbringing, filled with family, faith, and music. Owens shines a light on those old-school values with his debut album Where I\u2019m Coming From and his newest release It\u2019s A Southern Thing, working closely with a roster of country music's top songwriters \u2014 including Bob Diperio, Greg Barnhill, Tony Stampley, Wynn Varble, Brian Callihan and Trent Willmon \u2014 for his most upbeat collection of songs to date.\n\n\"Like a lot of my favorite country singers, I grew up singing Gospel music,\" says Owens, who grew up listening to artists like Randy Travis and Keith Whitley. \"I grew up the same way, and I've stayed true to my Traditional Country roots. I'm still singing about going to church, eating fried chicken, and keeping it country. Why wouldn't I? Once you start trying to be something you're not, that's when you lose track of where you're headed.\"\n\nLongtime country music journalist Robert K. Oermann agrees, pointing to Owens' traditional approach as his strongest weapon. \"I like to think that there are cycles in [country] music,\" Oermann explains. \"Usually, the pendulum swings out and the Pop-Country people bring in a whole lot of new listeners, and then the new listeners discover real Country music. Then there's usually a swing back to more traditional styles. I hope we're on the cusp of that\u2026 and if we are, Shane is perfectly positioned.\"\nA self-made road warrior who was recently named \"Independent Artist of the Year\" by MusicRow Reveals 2018 Country Breakout Awards, Owens continues to maintain an active schedule of listening room and honky tonk shows along with festival appearances. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut in 2017. He also appeared at summertime events like CMA Music Festival and Jamboree In the Hills, both of which were voted as the top two American country music festivals of the year. Cracker Barrel has picked Owens' music to appear in several of the store's exclusive releases, including Country Faith America and Country Faith Love Songs, while Netflix included his song \"Country Never Goes Out of Style\" in the popular series The Ranch. No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it. And I'm nowhere near done doing it.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8315551.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s 2005 self-released debut album set a precedent for how bands might begin to approach making music independently. The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "D-Nice ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/216802.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "D-Nice is the stage name of beatboxer, rapper, producer and photographer Derrick Jones (born June 19, 1970 in Bronx, New York), who began his career in the mid-1980s with the hip hop group Boogie Down Productions.

Adam Levy (Norah Jones, Tracy Chapman) guest performs on guitar during \u201cAll the Places That I\u2019ve Been\u201d, a song inspired by Trawick\u2019s ninety-seven year old grandmother and her stories of the World War II generation. Finally, the album closes with the band\u2019s unique take on \u201cWonderwall\u201d by Oasis, a track sure to trick the audience into thinking they\u2019re listening to another Trawick original.\n\nJustin Trawick has been performing in the Washington DC area and along the East Coast since 2006, citing musical influences like Bob Schneider, Greensky Bluegrass, The Tallest Man on Earth, G. Love, Old Crow Medicine Show, and David Gray. In June of 2015, Trawick released his first single, \u201cGoodbye\u201d, under the band name \"Justin Trawick and the Common Good\u201d; written about the search for direction and belonging in a world that constantly feels one step ahead of you. Trawick has performed for TedxEast in NYC at the City Winery, TedxPennsylvaniaAvenue in DC at the Newseum, and has opened for over 30 national acts including Suzanne Vega, Wyclef Jean, Brett Dennen, Blues Traveler, Enter The Haggis, Bob Schneider, and Edwin McCain, and shared bills with Dr. Dogg and The Avett Brothers. In February of 2014, Trawick won \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at the Washington Area Music Awards for his song \u201cAll the Places That I\u2019ve Been,\" which can be downloaded on iTunes as a single along with his five other solo records and EPs. Founder of the nationally touring show \u201cThe 9 Songwriter Series\u201d and co-founder of \u201cThe Circus Life Podcast\" with guests such as Kevin Eubanks, Chris Thomas King, Ernie Halter, Yarn, and Snuffy Walden, Trawick has built a brand that extends far beyond his home base in DC.

Yet the homespun, heartwarming music of family-oriented indie folk group GoldenOak provides evidence that the dense woods of the Pine Tree State might just be a better muse than the slick streets of New York and LA.\n\nGoldenOak is driven by the songwriting and harmonies of the brother-sister duo Zak and Lena Kendall. After a bit of a recording hiatus and a shift in personnel, the group is back with an enchanting pair of songs. \u201cRiver\u201d and \u201cPoet And The Painter\u201d find this collective simultaneously building on previous strengths while also striking out in an interesting new direction.\n\nZak Kendall explains that he and his sister had a heart-to-heart about how the band should sound once some intra-band changes took place. \u201cWith the original lineup, we were very much a four-piece group. Everybody had similar roles in the band and there was not really much of a lead, per se. As the band evolved and those two bandmates left, Lena and I kind of sat down and said, \u2018What we were doing is changing up, but what\u2019s staying the same is our relationship to each other, our musical journey as siblings.\u2019 I think with this music we\u2019ve kind of settled into that role. We\u2019ve learned to really understand and work with each other, write together more, bounce ideas off each other.\u201d\n\nThe pair leaned into the family-oriented dynamic when they dove into the new material, recorded at Rustic Studios in Portland. \u201cThe new stuff is built around that relationship and particularly our vocals and our harmonies,\u201d Zak says. \u201cLike on \u2018Poet And The Painter\u2019, there\u2019s no lead vocals on it. It\u2019s us singing harmonies the whole time, kind of like Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s early stuff. When I wrote \u2018River\u2019, I said to Lena, \u201cI\u2019m writing this song, but I want you to sing it.\u201d That was the first time that I had written lyrics for Lena to sing. And so it really became the closest to a partnership that it\u2019s ever been for us. We were really working closely together on this new stuff.\u201d\n\nEven as Zak and Lena found a new direction by honoring their musical bond, which they first started to form during campfire singalongs as youngsters, the new members of the band, bassist Mike Knowles and drummer Jackson Cromwell, also helped determine the sound of this single. Zak explains the process since the release of the band\u2019s 2017 EP Foxgloves: \u201cIt\u2019s been like a year-and-a-half or so since we released music. We were touring with a cellist and a trumpet player at the time. They were big focal points of a lot of our arrangements and a lot of our writing. When they left, we started playing with Mike and Jackson. And they started shaping the direction of what we were going to be putting out, because we wanted it to sound like our live set was sounding. It took a long period before we started working on new stuff because we were adjusting to having a new lineup and getting to know each other as musicians and bandmates. As we felt we were starting to click, we started working on a new stuff.\u201d\nSpeaking of that new stuff, \u201cRiver\u201d manages to seamlessly connect two different pieces of music that Zak had been writing. The moody music, accompanying verses about how political shifts are mirrored by the changing seasons, segues into a more upbeat outro, connected by a gorgeous moment of brother and sister singing a cappella, \u201cI\u2019ve come to witness the things I can\u2019t see.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cPoet And The Painter\u201d find the two in close-harmony throughout, but the shuffle of the rhythm section adds some momentum to the lyrical musings on the potency of nature.\n\nIn many ways, the themes of GoldenOak\u2019s music are driven by their home base. \u201cMaine is such an interesting place to be an artist,\u201d Zak says. \u201cIt\u2019s so remote in a lot of ways. And the landscape and the woods are so inspiring. People are often spread out, but there\u2019s also this amazing artistic community, not only in Portland but also in the towns all over Maine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing in a place like Maine, we\u2019re not surrounded by buildings. I think the art is very reflective of the landscape, the nature of Maine. As you walk through the woods, you never see the same thing twice. And I think that represents the Maine music scene in a perfect way.\u201d\n\nThat music scene has thrown its arms around GoldenOak, and, in return, the band is helping to draw more attention to it with these excellent new songs. \u201cThe Portland music scene is so friendly and welcoming,\u201d Zak says. \u201cI think, unfortunately, a lot of music scenes get competitive by nature. But that\u2019s something you just don\u2019t find in Portland. There\u2019s just a lot of fantastic people involved in it that kind of have that \u2018Mainer\u2019 attitude to help each other out and support each other.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
