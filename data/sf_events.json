Layered and lustrous, the music on her new full-length release, The Pieces Left, radiates from an organic center colored by electronic shadings and beats. As sonic light breaks through the opaque mist of a dense soundscape, the sound mirrors the drama of her locale: San Francisco, home to generations of visionaries. \u201cNothing is more dreamlike than the adventure of walking in this city,\u201d she says. \u201cI look out my window to see people in the street, a bus moving, a couple fighting on the corner, a homeless man. The inspiration for the album comes from what I visualize everyday.\u201d In addition to crafting the recordings, Francesca has been headlining with her band The New Believers at high profile NoCal venues like Yoshi\u2019s, Caf\u00e9 Du Nord and her home base, Hotel Utah. Selected for inclusion for the KFOG Local Scene 6 CD, Francesca was featured in a live broadcast and interview from San Jose on the station\u2019s Morning Show to celebrate the station\u2019s Local Music Month where she was greeted by a line of fans familiar with her song \u201cMaybe Today\u201d from its regular radio rotation. Additionally, she was featured in a live performance and an on camera interview on KOFYTV 20 Cable 13 in San Francisco and selected as an artist for \u201cBorn To Play Live Acoustic\u201d for Gap, Inc., when the retail giant hosted live music in 700 stores nationwide. Attracting cross-cultural audiences is her trademark: the mix of acoustic roots and electronic edges that she titles \u201cIntrospective Dream Pop\u201d resonates to a wide spectrum of listeners including artsy indie kids and fans of serious songwriting. The daughter of a Polish mother and a Japanese-born Korean father, Francesca grew up between the Bay Area and Texas. She graduated from high school in Alameda, California where she says she \u201ckept to myself and wrote songs.\u201d Her dream was to live in England. Accepted into the prestigious Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA) the college founded by Sir Paul McCartney, Francesca raised tuition money with street performances and personal fundraisers. \u201cDoing that set my foundation for what I do now \u2013 organizing and promoting music. I knew I could make it happen if I really wanted it,\u201d she notes. As a creator, Francesca incorporates an intuitive approach to songwriting. \u201cI have to feel that it comes from the subconscious, from another place. I can feel the story coming out as I let the words channel through me. Some of it is random, but if keep doing this I will get a lyric, or a feeling about what to write about. After that, I just let it flow and then I start making sense of it. But in the beginning I let the music come from my soul.\u201d This soul connection reverberates within The Pieces Left, in the wistful questions and celebratory moments that inhabit her songs. \u201cI always have hope,\u201d she says. \u201cThese songs are more of an observation than anything. They are not about me; they express the emotions that I feel.

The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF\u2019s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years \u2013 the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences \u2013 and it\u2019s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.\n\n\n\nOver time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project\u2019s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I\u2019ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur R\u00f3s discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.\n\n\n\nFollowing a European and a second US tour with Sigur R\u00f3s, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow.

They have created an inspiring movement and revolutionized the music scene in their native Peru by bridging a longstanding divide between the mainstream and the minority Afro-Peruvian community, who have struggled against discrimination and cultural dissolution for generations.\n\nDuring their career, Novalima has garnered worldwide critical acclaim from mainstream (NPR, UK Guardian, Wall Street Journal, La Presse, Metro, Billboard) and underground media (Giant Step, Remezcla, Sounds & Colors, Nat Geo) alike, delivered legendary performances around the world at festivals such as Roskilde, WOMAD, Pirineos Sur, NYC Central Park, Montreal Jazz Festival and Chicago\u2019s Millennium Park, earned a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Album, and were featured in cult filmmaker Robert Rodriguez\u2019s hit Mexploitation movie Machete.\n\nWhile their sound is futuristic and cutting-edge, the roots of Novalima\u2019s music reach back hundreds of years. In a far-too familiar tale, African slaves were brought to Peru as early as the 1500s until the middle of the 19th Century, establishing an outpost of the African-Diaspora on the Pacific coast of South America. Over the years, the soul and rhythms of Africa melded with the melodies and instruments of Europe and the Andes. The result is rich musical repertoire that existed for generations on the periphery of Peruvian popular culture.\n\nThe founders of Novalima, Ramon Perez-Prieto, Grimaldo Del Solar, Rafael Morales, and Carlos Li Carrillo, became friends and started playing together in Lima during their high school years, playing a pivotal part in the 80s underground hardcore punk, and the 90s psychedelic/acid-rock scenes. As children of artists and intellectuals, Ramon, Grimaldo, Rafael and Carlos were well educated and well traveled, and while they listened to traditional Peruvian folk music regularly in family reunions and in the street, they relentlessly explored new sounds in Rock, Dub Reggae, Latin and Electronic Music, which became grounds for their own discovery.\n\nDuring their early experimentations blending Afro-Peruvian sounds with electronica, the four founders were living in different parts of the world. From their homes in London, Barcelona, Hong Kong, and Lima, they emailed song ideas to each other. These long-distance recordings resulted in their 2002 debut album, the self-titled Novalima.\n\nThe reception to the album exceeded their wildest expectations, eventually reaching platinum sales status in Peru, and for their next album they invited more Afro-Peruvian musicians to join their recording sessions. The outcome was Afro, an album that was released worldwide in 2006 to tremendous acclaim and put Novalima on the international music map. The London Metro Evening Standard raved, \u201cNovalima has more than succeeded in bringing the spirit and soul of Peruvian blues into the 21st century.\u201d Afro held the #1 spot on the US College Music Journal Latin Alternative and New World Radio Charts for ten weeks combined.\n\nSoon after Afro was released, the founders returned to Lima and invited top Afro-Peruvian musicians to join Novalima making it a true band, setting the groundwork for live musical creation and intensive global touring.\n\nOn their 2009 album Coba Coba, released on the acclaimed world music label Cumbancha, Novalima expanded the critically-acclaimed formula they developed and took their inspiring fusion in new and exciting directions by delving further into the African diaspora and bringing influences from reggae, dub, salsa, hip-hop, afrobeat and Cuban son. In anticipation of the band\u2019s acclaimed 2009 US and European tour, they released Coba Coba Remixed, featuring exclusive remixes by top DJs and producers including Da Lata, Zeb, Faze Action, Seiji, Boozou Bajou, Haaksman, and more. At the same time, a stunning music video for the band\u2019s song \u201cCoba Guarango\u201d was featured on the homepage of YouTube and quickly amassed well over 100,000 plays in 24 hours.\n\nAfter two years of constant touring, the band gathered in their home studio in Lima to record and mix the album Karimba that took Novalima's sound into new places. They introduced both new sounds and traditional rhythms like the Panalivio, Zamacueca, Ing\u00e1 and Tondero, while maintaining their distinctive afro and dub sound. Their reputation at home allowed them to work with the top traditional musicians in the city, inviting vocalists Pepe Vasquez, Rosita Guzman, and Sofia Buitron as well as guitarists Roberto Arguedas and Felix Casaverde (former guitarist of Chabuca Granda), in addition to members of the live band.\n\nKarimba was released on ESL Music (Thievery Corporation) and garnered astounding accolades from NPR, Giant Step, Nat Geo Music and more, while also topping the iTunes World Music Chart and cracking the Top 10 Billboard World Music Chart. After the release, Novalima embarked on a worldwide tour that took them to stages in USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Latin American throughout 2012 - 2014.\n\nDuring extensive touring in 2014, Novalima recorded a new album, Planetario released on Wonderwheel Recordings on June 16th 2015. This new album had a strong connection to Colombia created through a remarkable recording session in Bogota organized by members of La-33 including Sidestepper vocalist Eka Mu\u00f1oz, Pernett and La Mamba Negra. The album also brings in artists from around the world such as Marc de Clive Lowe (UK/NZ) and Kumar (Cuban rapper based in BCN). To promote this release on summer 2015, Novalima embarked on it\u00b4s biggest US Tour that included more than 40 shows in well known stages, followed by an extensive European Tour on 2016.\n\nTaking a year off from touring during 2017, Novalima went back in the studio to explore and experiment with new sounds from Peru. This time around, the influences came not only from its African heritage but also from the exploration of ancient sounds, languages and instruments from the Andes and the Amazon. On this new album called Ch\u2019usay (Voyage in Quechua, the native language of the Inkas) to be released on September 2018 on Wonderwheel Recordings, Novalima goes one step further to enrich their sound by collaborating with new generations of local artists from the peruvian music scene. The release of the new album will also coincide with Novalima`s 15th Anniversary which will include a special color vinyl release of all their previous albums on July 1st and a European and US Tour on mid July, kick started by the release of two new singles from Ch\u2019usay.\n\nFor more information, music for review, and interviews contact us: info@novalima.net\nFor photographs and other support materials visit novalima.biz/press", "otherInfo": "*Novalima"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Blues Jam", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sun Nov 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Drop-In Blues Jam & Workshop (11/10/19) w/David Matthews"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Briston Maroney", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9162693.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Sun Nov 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-10", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bottom of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "Briston Maroney says a lot with a little.

Their unique approach of combining moving orchestral arrangements and shoegaze guitar noise is held in extremely high regard; so much so, that the band\u2019s musicianship and the diverse musical palette has eclipsed the Rock genre and exists within its own realm. As British Musical Magazine NME once stated, \"this is music for the Gods\". A particularly monumental live memory of the band was a special set of shows with a 23-piece orchestra in New York, Tokyo, London and Melbourne.\n\nTheir annual world tour consists of around 150 shows. The band has now visited over 57 countries (and counting) and proudly holds the title of being one of the most internationally successful bands in Japan. Both critics and fans of Rock music agree that MONO are one of the best live bands in existence.\n\nAfter releasing 10 successful albums including a live album with an orchestra in New York, the band received the highly regarded award \"The Marshall Hawkins Awards: Best Musical Score - Featurette\" from the Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema for their collaborative short film \"Where We Begin\" in 2015. The band was also nominated for \"Ariel Award for Best Original Music Score\" for the feature film \"The 4th Company\" which was released in 2016.\n\nNow in 2018, the band welcomes a new drummer Dahm and begins a new journey. Earlier in the year, the band was invited to London's Meltdown Festival as one of the headliners, personally requested by the 2018\u2019s curator Robert Smith of The Cure. The band shared the stage with artists such as My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails, Mogwai and Deftones.\n\nThe band has now completed recording their 10th album \"Nowhere Now Here\", which is scheduled to be released worldwide on January 25, 2019 to coincide with their 20 year anniversary. The album was once again produced by the band's longtime friend Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago.\n\n1999\u5e74\u7d50\u6210\u3001\u6771\u4eac\u51fa\u8eab4\u4eba\u7d44\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30a5\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30fb\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9MONO\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u3068\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30ba\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u3001\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u697d\u66f2\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u304c\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9ad8\u3044\u8a55\u4fa1\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u3001\u3082\u306f\u3084\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u57df\u3067\u306f\u53ce\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u97f3\u697d\u6027\u3092\u767a\u63ee\u3057\u3001\u30a4\u30ae\u30ea\u30b9\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u8a8cNME\u3067\u306f\"This Is Music For The Gods__\u795e\u306e\u97f3\u697d\"\u3068\u8cde\u8cdb\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u308223\u540d\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u3092\u5f93\u3048\u305f\u7de8\u6210\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b7\u30e7\u30a6\u3092\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u6771\u4eac\u30fb\u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30e1\u30eb\u30dc\u30eb\u30f3\u30672009\u5e74\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\n\u6bce\u5e74\u304a\u3088\u305d150\u672c\u306b\u304a\u3088\u3076\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u306f\u3053\u308c\u307e\u3067\u306b57\u30ab\u56fd\u306b\u6e21\u308a\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u6700\u3082\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e1\u3064\u3068\u3082\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u306f\u8a55\u8ad6\u5bb6\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u4e00\u3064\u3068\u540d\u58f0\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n\nNY\u3067\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u3068\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u3092\u542b\u308110\u679a\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3057\u3001\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u3067\u3082\u9ad8\u3044\u8a55\u4fa1\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u7d9a\u3051\u305f\u4e2d2015\u5e74\u306b\u306f\u3001\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u77ed\u7de8\u6620\u753b\"Where We Begin\"\u3067\u30ab\u30eb\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u56fd\u969b\u7684\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30ebIdyllwild International Festival of Cinema\u304b\u3089\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u8cde\"The Marshall Hawkins Awards: Best Musical Score - Featurette\"\u3092\u53d7\u8cde\u3002\u305d\u3057\u3066\u30012016\u5e74\u306b\u306f\u697d\u66f2\u63d0\u4f9b\u3092\u3057\u305f\u9577\u7de8\u6620\u753b\"The 4th Company\"\u304c\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u30fb\u30a2\u30ab\u30c7\u30df\u30fc\u8cde\"Ariel Award\"\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u8cde\u3067\u30ce\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\n\n2018\u5e74\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u30fcDahm\u3092\u8fce\u3048\u3001The Cure\u306e\u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u306e\u30ad\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u305fMeltdown Festival\u306bMy Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails, Mogwai, Deftones\u7b49\u3068\u5171\u306b\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u51fa\u6f14\u3059\u308b\u3002\u305d\u306e\u5f8c\u300110\u679a\u76ee\u3068\u306a\u308b\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u3092\u30d7\u30ed\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u306bSteve Albini\u3092\u8fce\u3048\u3001\u30b7\u30ab\u30b4\u306eElectrical Audio\u306b\u3066\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3002\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u306f2019\u5e74\u306e1\u6708\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Penny and Sparrow", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8018619.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sun Nov 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-10", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Duo.

It is this ethos that has allowed Adelaide\u201fs Hilltop Hoods to continue to rattle the keys to the Australian Hip Hop kingdom The trio Suffa, Pressure and DJ Debris began igniting the local Hip Hop scene back when they started grinding out impressive underground gigs off the back of a handful of early releases (\u201eBack Once Again\u201f, \u201eLeft Foot Right Foot\u201f and \u201eA Matter Of Time\u201f). They then smashed the Hip Hop doors open into the mainstream with the break out platinum record \u201eThe Calling\u201f. They turned the heads of rock fans, dance music devotees and even casual radio listeners with their infectious beats. The album produced the smash hit \u201eThe Nosebleed Section\u201f which became an unofficial anthem for the genre giving the crew widespread national radio play and public props for the most popular Australian hip hop track ever produced, making it in at #4 on the coveted Triple J\u201fs Hottest 100 of all time poll - the only track from this genre to do so, and the highest of any Australian act. The 2006 follow-up \u201eThe Hard Road\u201f, which debuted at #1 on the ARIA album chart and went on to become the group\u201fs second platinum album, landed 5 tracks in Triple J\u201fs Hottest 100, won two ARIA Awards and picked up the coveted J Award. Later, with the assistance of composer Jamie Messenger, the Hoods\u201f reworked \u201eThe Hard Road\u201f to create \u201eThe Hard Road Restrung\u201f, incorporating the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra. The album would go on to Gold certification and take home the 2007 ARIA Award for Best Urban Release. The Hoods\u201f continued breaking new ground when they produced the biggest selling Australian Hip Hop album of all time with \u201eState of the Art\u201f (2009). Debuting at #1 on the ARIA chart it held its position for two weeks (simultaneously being certified Gold). The album sailed past Double Platinum status after yielding the Double Platinum single \u201eChase That Feeling\u201f and Platinum single \u201eStill Standing\u201f. The album won the ARIA award for Best Urban Release and kept the group dominating radio airwaves and filling arenas around Australia and overseas. We last heard from Hilltop Hoods on 2012\u201fs \u201eDrinking From the Sun\u201f an album that changed the game again, becoming the group\u201fs 3rd consecutive #1 album and going Gold on the day of its release. It was then certified Platinum within just one week. They once again crossed over, taking one of the world\u201fs biggest pop stars in SIA, and throwing her unique vocal stylings over their most successful single to date, the Triple Platinum \u201eI Love It\u201f. They also struck a chord with some of their idols, working with Chali 2na of Jurassic 5, and The Roots\u201f Black Thought. Within a year the album reached Double Platinum with critical acclaim. In support of \u201eDrinking From the Sun\u201f the Hoods completed a maiden US tour in support of their recent signing with Fontana (USA). On top of this the Hoods\u201f released their music in markets all over the world via Universal Music, and subsequently completed sold out dates in Canada, UK, Germany and Switzerland (including festival appearances at Glastonbury, T In The Park, Open Air Frauenfeld, Splendour In The Grass and Wireless). Apart from their accomplishments on stage and in the studio, Hilltop Hoods also established one of Australia\u201fs most well respected Hip Hop Labels, Golden Era Records (GER), to promote some of Australia\u201fs finest local Hip Hop talent (Vents/Briggs/Funkoars/K21). Along with GER, the Hoods have never forgotten their roots, giving back to the Hip Hop Underground each year with the \u201eHilltop Hoods Initiative\u201f \u2013 a grant that the trio established in 2005 in conjunction with APRA to support up-and-coming Hip Hop/Soul artists around Australia. The Adelaide trio have managed to once again push the envelope for Australian hip hop with the incendiary \u201eWalking Under Stars\u201f, which picks up exactly where \u201cDrinking From The Sun\u201d left off. Literally. The cryptic message left at the end of the 2012 LP opens this record, confirming that the trio were indeed working on two records and their largest project to date. The group have now delivered a project unlike anything fans have heard before \u2013 songs that bounce but also provide a deeper insight into the band. The first single \u201eWon\u201ft Let You Down\u201f was recorded in the London Red Bull Studio\u201fs earlier in the year, and features one of the rising stars of the new soul generation, Maverick Sabre. \u201c\u201eWon\u2019t Let You Down\u2019 is something really different for us, something quite soulful. Maverick Sabre adds an element to our music that we\u2019ve never known before. He has a unique voice and style of delivery. I hope that people embrace this track as it\u2019s one of the most personal songs on the album, and one of our favourites\u201d\u2014 Suffa (HILLTOP HOODS). Apart from Maverick Sabre a series of guests appear on \u201eWalking Under Stars\u201f \u2013 New Zealand songstress Aaradhna, the legendary Brother Ali, ARIA Award winning soul rocker Dan Sultan and fellow Best Urban ARIA winner Drapht. While radio has already fallen in love with \u201eWon\u201ft Let You Down\u201f, Hip Hop heads will relish in the festival anthems in waiting. The undeniable nostalgic swagger of \u201eCosby Sweater\u201f and the melancholy harmonies of \u201eI\u201fm a Ghost\u201f both bring a unique sound synonymous with the Adelaide trio on one of the year\u201fs most anticipated releases. Despite the sold out shows, the multi platinum records and the astonishing success they\u201fve experienced thus far fans can take comfort in the fact that the Hoods\u201f are still taking risks in order to propel the culture forward.

We re-connected and, after a year and many, many cups of coffee, decided to work together.\n\nPeter was a major impetus for the project \u2013 how could I resist the opportunity to work with one of the songwriters who inspired me to become a songwriter? \u2013 but the mainstreaming of crowdfunding didn\u2019t hurt. My Kickstarter reached its initial, possibly-too-modest goal in two days and eventually generated almost $20,000. Crowdfunding can work for the financing part, but it\u2019s also great for gauging interest among your friends/fans. I needed that vote of confidence!\n\nThe result is Lost Soul, produced by Peter Case with twelve new songs culled from the hundred or so new ones since 2005. The album was recorded by Sheldon Gomberg at The Carriage House in Silver Lake, CA with superb musicians including Joseph Arthur (loops, electric guitar), Danny McGough (keyboards), Jonny Flaugher (bass), Danny Frankel (drums), Cindy Wasserman (harmony), and my good friends Marky and Kipp Lennon (harmony). It was a privilege to spend a few days playing with these guys, and I don\u2019t take it for granted.\n\nI\u2019m proud of this recording, which \u2013 thanks to Peter Case\u2019s vision and Joseph Arthur\u2019s loops, among many other things \u2013 relies on a less crafted, more visceral sound than the straightforward folk-rock in my catalog.\n\nMy ambitions are also different from the old days, when conquering the world still held some appeal: I just want a few more people to hear these songs. But, for me personally and perhaps for others, Lost Soul is about more than just the songs or the sound. As one fan put it in a recent email:\n\n\u201cYou know, I think seeing you \u2018back\u2019 could be the most inspiring thing I\u2019ve come across in years. After sleeping on it, I\u2019m rethinking all the things I thought I\u2019d never do again\u2026\u201d", "otherInfo": "Susan Werner"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Down and Outlaws", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8130398.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Sun Nov 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-10", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Rock And Roll, Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "In the year following Down and Outlaws' debut album release, the San Francisco quartet has played San Francisco's famed Outside Lands festival, shared bills with the likes of Meatbodies, Dead Meadow and members of Pavement, and honed their lives shows with ever-increasing energy and power.

Influenced by life's trials and turmoil, YDMC continues to blaze a unique trail through our ears and burn real images that we refuse to see in our minds. YDMC, born David Manson in Indianapolis, Indiana and raised in Jonesboro, Georgia, resides and pulls his inspiration within the city limits of San Jose, California. As one of the original members of Today's News and a sponsored skateboarder, YDMC has been recording music with the group since 2005. However, his beginning groundwork for his hip hop career began when he became a part of the San Jose State chapter of the internationally known Hip Hop Congress. After meeting chapter heads Wes, Temesgen and Warren (2003), YDMC quickly rose up the ranks of the chapter until eventually receiving the honor of leading the group as acting President. Within this time period, several of Manson's friends joined the chapter. After connecting with young San Jose producer B-A-C, YDMC with friends Legend, G.H.O.S.T, Solomon, The Precedence, G-Wiz, and new friend Madman, Today's News began recording tracks for the chapter's first mixtapes \"Expressions for Relief, Vols. 1 and 2\u201d (all proceeds went to the Red Cross for the Philippine\u2019s tsunami and Hurricane Katrina relief efforts) as individual artists. Shortly, after Today's News formed and was joined by Am-1, Labyrinth, and Mikhael (formally known as Judah) a little further down the road. Some of the struggles that have influenced YDMC in his lifelong road to power and his quest to become a great MC include having to work and hustle to pay for food, bills and studio time, surviving a brutal attack with brass knuckles in 2006 which left him near death (G.H.O.S.T. and B-A-C were also with him), failed relationships, and the unexpected passing of his younger cousin and Grandmother, which still vividly affects him because they were very influential supporters of his beginning music career [R.I.P. Andre Anthony Pittman (10/30/87 - 02/21/05) and Eleanor Miller, who passed 11/22/2008]. YDMC has been signed as a solo artist with Bay Area label RonDavoux Records since 2008, where he has released \u201cThe Out The Trunk Project\u201d (2009). He will soon drop his major debut album \" Under The Radar\" in mid 2011 featuring hit Bay Area greats DLabrie (mentor, \u201cbig brother\u201d and RDV president), The Jacka , Goldie Gold from The Federation, plus Messy Marv and Traxamillion (both made possible on behalf of Boogie Womack of Thizz Latin). YD is now working on several new projects at the same time with several up-and-coming artists as well as seasoned veterans in the local rap game. He has been entering MC battles, traveling outside of the Bay to promote, and is constantly performing (at both big and small shows), holding the title as the most consistently booked artist in the South Bay, period. YDMC is determined to bring a new style to hip hop while maintaining a close connection to its roots. With a combination of his self-proclaimed D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) mentality, intelligent, socio-political lyrics, and sharp business etiquette, he is destined to have a flourishing career and we are destined to support him. YDMC is a hyperactive, outspoken, multilayered, skateboarding MC from San Jose, CA.

He formed his first band \u201cReggae National Tickets\u201d in 1992 and they quickly reached success selling more than 200,000 records. They were the first Italian band to play at Sunsplash and Sumfest in Jamaica in the Nineties. After their success in Italy, Alborosie moved to Jamaica in 2000. His friendship with John Baker (ex-producer of Pm Dawn and member of Island Records) was decisive: he began to work in Baker\u2019s Geejam studio in the Jamaican countryside and, little by little, he worked as a sound engineer and producer for international artists such as Wyclef, Angie Stone and Sisco. He also recorded Manu Chao and Nubians at the time of their visits on the island. Thanks to his talent as a producer, he managed the group Digicel Rising. After this experience, he labelled his first record Alborosie on his own label Forward Music in 2004. Despite some good tracks, most notably Burnin\u2019 and Lootin with Ky-mani Marley, he would have to wait until 2006 to reach international recognition with Herbalist which was considered best song of the year by David Rodigan. Alborosie becomes the first white artist to be distributed in Jamaica by Bob Marley\u2019s label, Tuff Gong. Above his work as a producer (e.i. XXL Riddim, with the voices of Gentleman, Sizzla, Luciano, Ky-mani Marley), he continues his own recordings (hits like \u201cKingston town\u201d, \u201cSlam bam\u201d, \u201cPolice\u201d) and featurings with: U-Roy on \u201cPrecious\u201d, Sizzla on \u201cMeditation\u201dand Gentleman on \u201cCelebration\u201d. His first solo album, \u201cSoul Pirate\u201d, was released in September 2008 under the Forward Recordings label. This first album was preceded by a limited edition distributed during the European tour. \u201cSoul Pirate\u201d voices the best reggae deejay in the world, David Rodigan, which samples his own track that made him famous in the world of reggae music. In 2009 Alborosie closed his own record label to begin working with Shang Yeng Clan studios, which launched the young artist I-eye with the single \u201cMama She Don\u2019t Like You\u201d. In 2009 Alborosie returned to Italy and Europe supported by \u201cShengen Clan Band\u201d to present his new album, \u201cEscape from Babylon\u201c, presenting 16 exclusive tracks featuring famous artists such as Dennis Brown and Gramps Morgan of Morgan Heritage. \u201cEscape from Babylon\u201d was released by the legendary label, Greensleeves Records, founded in London in 1975 by Chris Sedgwick and Chris Cracknell. It was later purchased in 2008 by VP Records, which produced artists like Shabba Ranks, Sizzla, Dennis Brown, Elephant Man and Vybz Kartel alongside historical reggae anthems such as Sean Paul\u2019s \u201cGet Busy\u201d, Shaggy\u2019s \u201cOh Carolina\u201d and Beenie Man\u2019s \u201cWho Am I\u201d. The first months of 2010 saw Alborosie engaged in a world tour that included dates in Mexico and California. Alongside his tour of the USA, Alborosie released the album \u201cEscape From Babylon To The Kingdom of Zion\u201d which unlike his previous album includes 18 tracks with new songs like: \u201cBoo Blue Movie\u201d and \u201cStepping Out\u201d featuring David Hines (frontman of Steel Pulse, the reggae band that won a Grammy Award in 1986). In July 2010, Alborosie released the album \u201cDub Clash\u201c. Albo himself plays on most of the tracks, drums, bass, keyboards, guitar and percussion, along some of the musicians from the shengen clan. \u201cDub clash\u201d is recorded and mixed at Shengen Studio kingston jamaica by Alborosie and is the first dub album from jamaica in a long time with that authentic roots spring reverb sound. Dedicated to King Tubby \u201cThe most incredible producer ever lived, the teacher\u201d, Albo offers the following information: \u201cThis album was entirely made in Kingston Jamaica with original organic vintage effects, Roland Space Echo, Fisher spring reverb, ak 9 spring reverb, Ak 47 spring reverb, Fairchild reverb, Multivox delasy, eli delay, MCI 2 tracks, Tascam 24 track.\u201d He also reveals \u201cReal dubwise should be the parmiggiano on a great plate of pasta\u2026 other than that!!!

Since dropping her first project Unorthodox in 2011, fast forward seven years later and she is a mainstay in the hip-hop world \u2013 selling out national tours, two successful merch lines, countless projects, and most importantly, a legion of loyal fans. Snow has become a symbol of hard work, perseverance and raw talent. Her relatability goes beyond gender or ethnicity, Snow refuses to conform to societal expectations and stands up for issues that she believes in whether it\u2019s women\u2019s rights, immigration, or other political issues.\n\nBorn in San Jose, CA to Mexican immigrant parents that dealt with the struggles of being undocumented and raising children born in the U.S., Snow grew up both bilingual and bicultural. She is able to rap in both in English and Spanish and incorporate melodies reminiscent to the \u201890s era R&B she grew up loving. Equally as talented singing as rapping, she developed her vocal skills singing along to both R&B classics, as well as Spanish baladas. Snow started performing at a young age before putting out multiple mixtapes and dropping viral music videos/songs on YouTube, which gained the attention of both fans and respected emcees, and eventually landed her a deal with Atlantic Records.\n\nA well-known artist with a strong social media presence, Snow has over 109 million views on YouTube, 2.6 million fans on Facebook, 678k fans on Instagram, and has a legion of loyal fans awaiting her new releases. Snow\u2019s musical influences stem from Mexican legend Alejandra Guzman to international rap star, Drake. She has been recognized and respected throughout the hip-hop industry for carving her own lane. Her reputation as a spitfire performer has her nonstop energy shows selling out from the West to East Coast. In addition, Snow has utilized her business and marketing ability to successfully create and build the \u2018Woke\u2019 brand, which includes the clothing line Woke Apparel and her online series Woke.tv.\n\nIn 2016, Snow Tha Product released her debut EP under Atlantic Records, \u2018Half Way There...Pt. 1.\u2019 The project had two standout tracks, \u201cNights\u201d and \u201cNuestra Cancion.\u201d The following year, she dropped a remix titled, \u201cNuestra Cancion Pt. 2,\u201d featuring reggaeton star Arcangel that hit #4 on the Latin Urban Radio Billboard charts. The music video has gone on to garner over 14.6 million views on YouTube, making it Snow\u2019s most-watched video to date. That same year, she contributed to the popular \u2018Hamilton Mixtape,\u2019 on the track \u201cImmigrants (We Get the Job Done)\u201d alongside K'naan, Riz MC, and Residente. In late 2017, she released her latest mixtape \u2018Vibe Higher,\u2019 which featured her artists LexTheGreat, Castro Escobar, and AJ Hernz. The mixtape was followed by a nationwide 30-date tour.\n\nBeyond her lyrical capabilities and entrepreneurial skill, Snow Tha Product has proven to be a talented actress. In 2017, she made her official acting debut in the second season of USA Network's highly-rated TV series Queen of The South, portraying the character of Lil' Traviesa. Last year, she also won an MTV VMA for \u2018Best Fight Against the System\u2019 video for \u201cImmigrants (We Get the Job Done)\u201d from The Hamilton Mixtape.

Their soaring vocals and metaphorical lyrics tell complex and vulnerable stories that find a way of weaving midwestern charm, animal behavior, country living, weather patterns, farming, working class humor, grief, plant ecology, queerness, white fragility, and birds.....so many birds.... into nest-like songs that make a home for what your heart has always longed to hear. The vehicle of their songs change like seasons from piano and guitar to ukulele and banjo performing both solo and with a 4 piece band. Currently, Dillbilly has made a home in Oakland, CA where they have teamed up with renowned musician and producer Julie Wolf, of Julie Wolf Music, to create their 10th full length record which will be released in 2019.\n\n\n\nRaised in a rural trailer park near the Ohio River, Dill grew up surrounded by cornfields, grain silos spending most of their time going jug fishing and playing classical piano. At 18, they won a piano scholarship that sent them to Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. Over the past 20+ years, they have been performing and touring across the U.S. and Canada releasing 9 full length albums as well as contributions to soundtracks for movies and TV under their birth name, Denise Dill. Most of those releases were self recorded and produced. Since moving to the Bay Area in 2015, they renamed their musical self and chose a name that more accurately embodies where they come from, where they draw inspiration, who they collaborate with, and how they identify as a genderqueer person.\n\n\n\nWhether the vehicle of the song is guitar, uke, banjo, sax, or piano, Dill\u2019s songwriting is \u201c[\u2026] so strong you can taste it. It is sweet, spicy, savory, organic, homegrown, lots of twists, sometimes complex, sometimes so simple, and oh so very delicious! Their albums makes you want to sit in a rocking chair on a front porch in the fall while eating peach salsa, or wander out deep in the woods without knowing were you\u2019ll end up,\u201d says artist and friend Margaret Belton of San Franscisco, CA.\n\n\n\nBranching into filmscoring, Dillbilly has composed for two full length films from Roundpoint Movies videomaker, Craig Saddlemire as well as one TV series. Neighbor by Neighbor: Mobilizing an Invisible Community in Lewiston, ME (2009) features a theme song written by Dill. Household: Four Stories of Kinship and Community (2013) features an original soundtrack to the full length documentary. Finally, My So-called Housing Cooperative (2013), a web TV series features a theme song written by Dill.\n\n\n\nDill\u2019s last full length solo release, Heavy Joi, is \u201da sparkling work of thought and labor,\" says music critic Elijah Tru. \"Heavy JOI is evidence of Dill\u2019s growth as an artist showcasing a complete and mature batch of thirteen songs that gives this album both weight and levity, as the album title implies. Dill\u2019s lyrics and instrumentation are meaningful and complex. Each component is about substance not style. They broach difficult and complicated emotional issues that adults experience but are rarely able to articulate in such a beautiful way\".", "otherInfo": "Heather Mae, Dillbilly at Neck of the Woods"}, {"Address": "101 6th st, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Rodney", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sun Nov 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "WERD. | Teeyam / Rodney (They're Here) WERD. every Sunday with the San Fracisco's best underground House & Techno.

Everything you leave behind opens up space for something new in your life.\u201d\n\nThat was certainly the case with Little\u2019s remarkable new album, \u2018aloha.\u2019 Written in only eight days and recorded at Paris\u2019s iconic Studio Ferber, the entire project was an exercise in letting go, in ceding control, in surrendering to fate. While Little still plays nearly every instrument on the album himself, he put his songs in the hands of an outside producer for the first time here, collaborating with French studio wizard Renaud Letang (Feist, Manu Chao) to create his boldest, most self-assured statement yet.\n\nEqual parts vintage and modern, the collection blends classic soul, old-school R&B, and adventurous indie sensibilities into a timeless swirl fueled by gritty instrumental virtuosity and raw, raspy vocals. It\u2019s an ambitious work of vision and reflection, to be sure, but more than that, it\u2019s an ecstatic testament to the freedom that comes from torching the map and trusting the currents of life to carry you where you belong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always produced myself in the past,\u201d explains Little, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to get caught up in an endless quest for perfection when you do that. Working with Renaud let me see my work from an outsider\u2019s perspective, and that helped me get out of my own way.\u201d\n\nBorn Aaron Earl Livingston to a preacher and a teacher in Los Angeles, Little first came to international prominence with his self-titled debut, released in 2015 on ANTI- Records. While Little\u2019s collaborations with The Roots and RJD2 had already helped him make a name for himself by that point in his adopted hometown of Philadelphia, critics on both sides of the pond were quick to recognize the unique power of Little\u2019s solo recordings, which stripped the past for parts that could be reconstituted into something wholly new and original. NPR hailed Little\u2019s \u201cimpeccably crafted songs\u201d as \u201chonest and unpretentious,\u201d while The Independent proclaimed him \u201ca formidable talent,\u201d and Vice declared that he was \u201cdissolving the barrier between R&B and rock 'n' roll one tearjerker at a time.\u201d\n\nSongs from the record racked up roughly 30 million streams on Spotify alone, and the album landed Little dates with everyone from Leon Bridges and Kelis to Shakey Graves and Mumford & Sons alongside festival appearances at Bonnaroo, Newport Folk, and more. Never one to rest on his laurels, Little showed off his production chops the following year, earning a GRAMMY Award for his work helming Mavis Staples\u2019 acclaimed \u2018See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,\u2019 and in 2017, he released a critically lauded sophomore album, \u2018New Magic,\u2019 which Paste said \u201cdid for the blues what Sharon Jones did for soul music.\u201d\n\nBy now, it\u2019s probably clear that Son Little likes to keep busy. In order to create \u2018aloha,\u2019 though, Little knew he\u2019d have to do the unthinkable: sit still. The next thing Little had to let go of was even more challenging. Just weeks before he was set to begin assembling the album demos in Petaluma, California, his hard drive fried, taking with it nearly a dozen detailed demos for new songs. For a meticulous planner like Little, it was a devastating blow, one that left him with no choice but to start over.\n\n\u201cLosing all that material felt like a nightmare at the time, but I\u2019ve since learned to see it as an opportunity,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t lost all those songs, I never would have written all the new stuff that became \u2018aloha.\u2019\u201d\n\nBeginning again with what was essentially a blank slate, Little penned much of the new album in Petaluma, in a tiny house and it\u2019s adjacent barn. He let the songs take him on a journey of self-exploration there, examining the kind of big-picture questions that emerged from his subconscious in the quiet stillness: What am I doing? How did I get here? Who do I really want to be?\n\n\u201cI let the dust settle after a hectic year, and stopped worrying about the music for a minute,\u201d explains Little. \u201cI tried to just tune in to what was happening in my mind, to just be present in my body. It was liberating.\u201d\n\nThat sense of liberation is clear from the very beginning of \u2018aloha,\u2019 with album opener \u201chey rose\u201d showcasing Little\u2019s freewheeling way with words and lean, swaggering delivery. Inspired by the sense of infatuation that comes with new love, the track sets the stage for an album full of unflinching self-examination and daring sonic fusion. Little injects trippy psychedelia into Sam Cooke soul on the slow-burning \u201cabout her. again.,\u201d channels Prince and Michael Jackson on the breezy \u201c3rd eye weeping,\u201d and marries sparse, distorted guitar tones with clean, dense vocal harmonies on the infectious \u201cmahalia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat song\u2019s an apology delivered at the start of a relationship, instead of the end, when it all falls apart\u201d says Little, who often collapses time and space in his writing by combining characters and scenes from throughout his life. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking a lot about how I find myself repeating the same mistakes in different areas of my life. I find myself drawn over and over to the same qualities in different people, and sometimes the dynamic can become toxic. Pointing the finger is easy. I\u2019m trying to be better at acknowledging my part of the problem.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the power of our own self-destructive tendencies is a recurring theme on \u2018aloha.\u2019 Little mourns the suicide of a beloved uncle on \u2018suffer\u2019, using addiction and mental illness as a lens to explore forgiveness and empathy, laments the rapidly deteriorating world his two children are set to inherit on \u2018o clever one,\u2019 and meditates on the dangers of succumbing to passion at the expense of reason on \u201cbelladonna.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lightness that comes from being so deeply in love with a person or an idea,\u201d says Little. \u201cBut there\u2019s a danger that comes with it, too. It\u2019s like a drug: a little bit and you feel incredible; too much and it kills you.\u201d\n\nIt would be easy to feel helpless in the face of such inexorable forces, to feel as if we are prisoners of fate rather than masters of our own destiny, but Little instead finds peace in perseverance on the album. \u201cHallelujah,\u201d he sings on the gorgeous \u2018neve give up,\u2019 \u201cthough I\u2019m battered and blue / feel like I\u2019m born to lose\u2026Never will I give up.\u201d\n\nIt is a potent reminder that letting go doesn\u2019t mean giving in; in fact, quite the opposite. Letting go can be an act of defiance, of growth, of empowerment. Letting go requires a leap of faith, and, in Son Little\u2019s case, that faith has been richly rewarded. Whether that means this album represents the end of one chapter or the beginning of the next is impossible to know just yet, but in either case, there\u2019s really only one thing to say: aloha.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always produced myself in the past,\u201d explains Little, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to get caught up in an endless quest for perfection when you do that. Working with Renaud let me see what I was doing from an outsider\u2019s perspective, let me see the songs from a bird\u2019s-eye view. It was liberating to have someone there to help me focus on the bigger picture like that.\u201d\n\nLittle\u2019s newfound liberation is clear from the outset of \u2018invisible,\u2019 which revels in freewheeling wordplay and daring sonic juxtaposition. Opener \u201chey rose\u201d marries distorted, jittery guitar with smooth, sinuous vocals, while the slow-burning \u201cabout her. again.\u201d injects trippy psychedelia into Sam Cooke soul, and a cover of \u201cSkid\u201d from Love\u2019s long lost masterpiece \u2018Black Beauty\u2019 uses a 1973 meditation on homelessness to make a pointed statement about our indifference to suffering in modern America.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that song a million times, but I didn\u2019t realize how relevant the lyrics were until I recorded it myself,\u201d says Little. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to become desensitized to people's pain when you encounter so much of it every day, but every single person you see struggling, wherever they're at, is a human being with their own story.\u201d\n\nBorn Aaron Earl Livingston to a preacher and a teacher in Los Angeles, Little first came to international prominence with his self-titled 2015 debut. While Little had already made a name for himself in his adopted hometown of Philadelphia for his collaborations with hip-hop legends The Roots and electronic pioneer RJD2, critics on both sides of the pond were quick to recognize the unique power of his solo recordings. They didn\u2019t simply revive sounds from the past, but rather stripped them for parts and reconstituted them into something wholly new and original. NPR hailed Little\u2019s \u201cimpeccably crafted songs\u201d as \u201chonest and unpretentious,\u201d while The Independent proclaimed him \u201ca formidable talent,\u201d and Vice declared that he was \u201cdissolving the barrier between R&B and rock 'n' roll one tearjerker at a time.\u201d\n\nSongs from the record racked up roughly 30 million streams on Spotify alone, and the album landed Little dates with everyone from Leon Bridges and Kelis to Shakey Graves and Mumford & Sons alongside festival appearances at Bonnaroo, Newport Folk, and more. Never one to rest on his laurels, Little showed off his production chops the following year, earning a GRAMMY Award for his work helming Mavis Staples\u2019 acclaimed \u2018See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,\u2019 and in 2017, he released a critically lauded sophomore album, \u2018New Magic,\u2019 which Paste raved \u201cdid for the blues what Sharon Jones did for soul music.\u201d Little hit the road for dates with Dr. Dog and X Ambassadors behind the record in addition to crisscrossing the country for extensive headline touring (much of it featuring Jade Bird as support) and festival performances at Hangout, Sasquatch, and Pilgrimage among others.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Scott Guberman", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8809008.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Mon Nov 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-11", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Rock, Rock, Rock \\, Roll, Beyond", "Time": "6:45 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Guberman performs regularly with Grateful Dead's founding bassist, Phil Lesh.\n\nScott Guberman has become an outstandingly important member of the Bay Area music scene in between his shows with Phil Lesh, appearing most often at Terrapin Crossroads.

Having been birthed from the indie/punk boom of the early twenty-first century, Say Anything rose to prominence with their (oddly) popular record \u2026Is a Real Boy and somehow broke the \"pretty boy punk\" mold by establishing a career that thrived somewhere between music your pretentious college student of an older brother would like and the loud crap that your little brother uses to annoy him with.

Tessie has been exposed to music her entire life. Covering hit songs by the beatles and more with her father at just the tender age of 2, Tessie was destined to sing. With a musician and instrumentalist as a father, Tessie began to dabble with instruments herself. She began covering some of her favorite songs on YouTube while playing the ukelele. Despite her heavy exposure to rock from her father and kuya (older brother) she eventually gravitated towards artist like JoJo, Alicia Keys and Jazmine Sullivan to name a few.\nTessie\u2019s music could be best described as a soundtrack to the life of the everyday girl stuck in her 20 somethings. Offering the nostalgic vibes of early 2000\u2019s R&B, she also has a very modern, melodic, and fun way of delivering her feelings. She could get quite eventful with the cadences and flows she opts to use in some of her tracks. Tessie\u2019s music possesses a very intimate and vulnerable feel. She has a way of placing you right in her sandals for the duration of the song. It\u2019s almost as if she uses songwriting as a method of taking accountability and healing her wounds. She does extremely well at turning her insecurities into art and putting them on display for the listener.\nTessie has been working the past few years at finding herself and along with that came a sound and style solely of her own. In 2017 she began releasing music as part of a duo with rapper / best friend Tota under the name WeAreYou. Garnering mild success following a few releases such as their single Shhhlide which currently sits at over half a million streams on Spotify, Tessie began to create more and set out to establish a lane as a solo artist as well.\nTessie just recently released her debut single titled, \u201cRude Boy\u201d on January 28th following a headlining show in the Bay Area which she calls home. On the surface Rude Boy is a fun melodic record with commercial appeal but when you dive past the soothing vocals and airy guitars into the lyrics it\u2019s a perfect example of Tessie\u2019s ability to make something as serious and vulnerable as her relationship woes and struggles with self-love into a fun enjoyable experience for the listener. Opening the track with the line, \u201cI thought I was done messing with you, but you found your way back up in my room\u201d Tessie immediately sets the scene and tone of the track where she talks about her struggles dealing with a toxic lover.\nTessie is positioning herself to have an eventful year!

This led to him not noticing the prominent presence of racial inequality until becoming of age and actually learning about and experiencing systemic oppression first hand. Finding out later in life that his grandfather was a member of the original Black Panther party, he kicked his studies into overdrive and really found himself. He began to dedicate much of his music to shed light on the war against his people and how oppression has affected urban cities in America. Though not possessing a traditional Bay Area sound, he does not shy away from letting people know where he\u2019s from as he did in his drake inspired track \u201c6PM In Vallejo\u201d where he displays his talents delivering bar after bar for an entire 3 minutes.\nTota possesses a storytelling capability comparable to a Nas or J. Cole. He often supplements this storytelling ability with witty, sometimes comedic punchlines. Though not having the most prominent voice he does have a way of making his presence felt through his use of tonality, flow, and cadence. Every track encompasses a different feeling and energy often driven by content filled, sociopolitical messages. The passion and emotion he provides in tracks often leaves the listener with the perception that the track was felt more so than heard.\nTota often uses his upbringing and life experiences to take you on a journey into his world. He has a knack for making his experiences feel extremely relative to the listener even if they\u2019ve never had such experience themselves. He tends to be extremely open and forward about his life which often connects and resonates with the listener on a personal level.\nThough his sound is immensely different than those who he deems as influences, you can still hear the attack of a Kendrick Lamar, the realism of a J. Cole and the comedic wit of a Kanye West whom he gives huge attribution to for molding his sound.\nIn January Tota released his debut project \u201cThe Field Effect\u201d which is a politically driven ode about the mentality oppression and racism has created within the black community. It is an open discussion shedding light on the ugly truths of how systemic racism from slavery days, subsequently affects black people now. Tota uses this project to narrate the experiences and trials he and many other inner-city youths have and still face till this day.\nFollowing a headlining show in his hometown, July 28th Tota released his second project titled, \u201cNever Forget Who You Are\u201d. Tota follows his strong conscious debut \u201cThe Field Effect\u201d with an even stronger message. In this album he touches on depression, oppression, conditioning, happiness, pain and every other emotion you can feel. The delivery is much tighter, and the songs are filled with melodic aggression and soul. Tota really opens up on this album about personal issues in his own life rather than just speaking on social issues like he did in the \u201cField Effect\u201d. Once again Tota delivers with witty bars and insane delivery. The cover is a picture of him and his grandmother in which he uses as a reminder of where he comes from and who he truly is. \u201cNever Forget Who You Are\u201d is a note to self that no matter how abundant this life becomes, you cannot lose yourself within it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109-5519", "Artist": "In Flames", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9013215.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Mon Nov 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-11", "Genre": "Genres: Metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1990, In Flames is world-renown as one of the forefathers of Melodic Death Metal.

Together with virtuosos Rob Reich\u2013accordion and Craig Venetresco\u2013guitar, superlative bassist Ari Munkres and versatile percussionist Steve Apple, these guys keep crowds moving with their beats and complex rhythms.\n\nGaucho has recorded seven albums, tours regularly, and has an increasing repertoire of over forty original tunes. Seven of their tunes are featured in the 2012 film \"Trattoria\"; one was chosen by the Metropolitan Museum of Art for their website; and another is featured in the outtakes section of the Pixar DVD CARS 2.", "otherInfo": "Gaucho at Comstock Saloon: The Barbary Coast re-created by the Comstock Saloon would have appeared to the denizens of the 19th-century vice district as a utopian fantasy. The saloon's booths are occupied by mixed groups, the bartenders have all their teeth, and the booze won't make you go blind. That doesn't make the romance it stages any less potent, because everything about the place is so beautifully realized. Jonny Raglin and Jeff Hollinger's take on classic cocktails such as Pisco Punches and South Sides is deft, and even defter is the way chef Carlo Espinas lightens and modernizes Victorian dishes - beans and salt pork, Hamburg steak, beef-shank and bone marrow pie - so they feel as contemporary as a well-made Manhattan."}, {"Address": "500 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "M.O.M.", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.437364, 37.774222], "Date": "Mon Nov 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Madrone Art Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"M.O.M.

He took me to the Beacon, The Ryman, Massey Hall, all these leg-endary rooms. Just to see that what I could do would even translate in spaces like that was revelatory.\u201d\nHarper says he instantly recognized a kindred spirit in Stelling\u2019s virtuosic finger picking and soulful delivery. \u201cIt was like finding a John Fahey or Leo Kottke that was a really great singer,\u201d he explains.\nThe recording of Best Of Luck culminated on a rainy night in Los Angeles, but the whole thing really began back in North Carolina. Stelling calls Asheville home, though he has been in a state of near constant motion for years. Leaving Florida while young to roam and perfect his craft, he made stops in Colorado, Boston, Seattle, New York and eventually North Carolina - all interspersed with relentless touring - hundreds of performances a year, in bars, coffee houses, nightclubs and theaters.\n\u201cThe lifestyle of constant touring was gaining on me,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd then I was back home, and in the abrupt silence, there was a clarity. The fumes of hubris I had been running on for years were all but gone and my relationship with my environment and myself had turned toxic. I was scared but resolved to persevere. On Christmas Day, after a few false starts, I gave up drinking and decided to take a look at myself.\u201d\nAnd then, as if following some greater cosmic narrative, an email arrived that New Year\u2019s Day. It was Harper asking if he would be interested in making a record in Los Angeles. \u201cI had never worked with a producer before,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cI had always con-trolled everything; it was how I had survived. But I needed a mentor and a friend; I was too far from shore.\"\nStelling accepted an artist\u2019s residency at the Stetson Kennedy House outside of Jack-sonville Florida to prepare. Kennedy had been a folklorist and comrade of Woody Guthrie and Zora Neale Hurston. Woody stayed there for extended periods as well. \u201cI moved into this little house in a North Florida swamp just an hour from where I was born and raised,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd I proceeded to freak out. It was the first time I\u2019d just sat still for years. Mostly, I took inventory of myself. But I left feeling like I\u2019d found a thread. After that, I would send Ben demos. He would respond with encouragement and tell me to keep digging, so I\u2019d keep digging. Looking back, the whole process was the medicine I needed.\u201d\nBest Of Luck is a supremely accessible and finely crafted record that deftly merges genres. Harper, who has previously produced records by Mavis Staples, Rickie Lee Jones, The Blind Boys of Alabama and others, recruited an all-star rhythm section with Jimmy Paxson (Stevie Nicks, Dixie Chicks) on drums and upright bass player Mike Va-lerio (Randy Newman, LA Philharmonic) to lend a versatility and finesse. \u201cI really be-lieve this record is the intersection where folk and soul meet,\u201d Harper says.\nThe album\u2019s title, Best Of Luck, mirrored perfectly the emotional landscape in which it was created. \u201cDepending on how you say it, it can either be a blessing or a dismissal,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd that was exactly the point I was coming to with myself, my career as an artist, as a friend and as a person.\u201d\nThe first track, \u201cHave To Do For Now\u201d is a haunting evocation of a moment between an unexamined past and an uncertain future. The guitar refrain evokes a beautiful sense of wistfulness about the past. \u201cIt\u2019s a song about the fear of losing memories and the re-lief of letting them go,\u201d Stelling explains. \u201cIt was written in one sitting. A flood of memo-ries moving back to when I was very young and I fell from a tree house and split my head open. I\u2019d never really processed that trauma but it\u2019s one of my earliest and most visceral memories. I can\u2019t help but wonder how that day and others like it have influ-enced my life.\u201d\nThe sonic simplicity of \u201cLucky Stars\u201d reveals a richness of melody and emotionality. \u201cIt\u2019s part love song, part lullaby,\u201d Stelling says of the track, \u201cwith a gentle touch from the band and Ben\u2019s haunting lap steel matching my guitar in the instrumental section, ad-ditional vocals by my partner. It\u2019s about gratitude and the mysteries of the universe. Even to just be here and marvel at it all is enough for me most times. Even if it\u2019s mean-ingless, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\nThroughout the record, discontent and self-doubt are transformed into messages of resilience and hope. \u201cTrouble Don\u2019t Follow Me\u201d captures this perfectly, with an upbeat almost anthemic rhythm and soulful, gospel-tinged vocals. \u201cIt comes as no surprise to me that one of my most optimistic songs could be written in the most difficult hour,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cWhen all I needed was a little hope and a song I could play night after night and not get tired of. Something that captured the basic recipe for endurance. A song about marching on, a warning to anything that might stand in your way, and needing to feel strong for the people around you, so you can inspire them to do the same.\u201d\nThere is an uninhibited defiance to \u201cUntil I Die,\u201d a revved up folk-blues featuring a beautifully raw guitar and beat. \u201cThis song is a kaleidoscope in the hall of mirrors, a psychedelic rant,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cOne thing is for certain amidst the chaos and uncer-tainty, and that is having someone to love and who loves you back is unrivaled.\u201d\nWhen Harper talks about his admiration for Stelling, he refers to his family\u2019s legendary folk music store, filled with instruments and a fluid merging of styles and genres. \u201cWhen I listen to Chris, I hear my grandparent\u2019s store in Claremont,\u201d Harper says. \u201cHe\u2019s carrying on that tradition. A guy that can play any instrument from any country and play it with real feeling. He crosses genres but manages to respect them; he is a folk singer with an unusual soulfulness. He understands where this music comes from and why it\u2019s remains so essential. Of all the record\u2019s I have produced, this is one I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d\nFor his part, Stelling says, \u201cThis record was about learning to trust the people around me. If anything, after years of closely guarded decision-making I\u2019m delighted by the re-sults of this collaboration. This record has an undeniable sense of clarity. The songs are lean but never feel incomplete. Ben knew how to coax me out of my well-worn comfort zones, how to move fast and spontaneously and put me on the spot, and how to retreat and give me space to process things. People who know me have said they hear a lot more of me in this album than anything before. Realizing I couldn\u2019t heal the world, I started to heal myself, and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased by how that sounds.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109-5519", "Artist": "Red", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9146941.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Mon Nov 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-11", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Alternative, Ambient", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "To be human is to wonder what happens when you\u2019re gone and to question your existence in the meantime: Why am I here, and what will be left of me when I\u2019m not? For the members of RED\u2014Michael Barnes and identical twins Anthony and Randy Armstrong\u2014the fearless search for those answers lives with them every day, on the road, in their records, and in their latest release, GONE.\n\n\u201cWe dug a little deeper, talking about issues like what we\u2019re leaving behind for our families, what we\u2019re leaving behind for the people who knew us,\u201d Randy says of the trio\u2019s sixth studio album since their Grammy-nominated debut, END OF SILENCE, in 2006.\n\n\u201cIf we died tomorrow, what would be the legacy that we leave behind? What would people talk about us for? That's not just as a band but as individuals,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody, at some point in their life, contemplates their mortality and wonders if people will miss them when they're gone or what they'll say about them when they're gone.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what one reviewer said about that, after RED was gone from a Columbus, Ohio, stage: \u201cLyrically, their performance was smart, with their own brand of uplifting-yet-heavy edge, with a real focus on finding the beauty in everyday life, pain, and strife.\u201d\n\nThat Rock Revolt review, of a RED set opening for Breaking Benjamin in May 2017, went on to say: \u201cThe dose of hope in the trenches that they delivered hit the spot.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the very same message in GONE\u2019s 17 tracks (on the deluxe edition \u2013 10 tracks on the standard), a richly textured and powerfully felt musical narrative from three musicians who grew up together in Pennsylvania. Friends for nearly 30 years, they\u2019ve always asked those questions, and with GONE, they\u2019re responding to those same questions from everyone else.\n\n\u201cWe have had countless conversations with fans over the last 11 years touring, and people share their hearts with us,\u201d Randy says. \u201cThey share their insecurities, their fears. Us having a faith and the background that we do, we carry those things with us no matter what kind of questions we ask ourselves because our music has that redemptive side. We find our way out of the darkness.\u201d\n\nWhile RED has long since established itself as a million-selling juggernaut with two Grammy nods, six Dove Awards, and 17 Dove nominations, the band says they still \u201clive and die\u201d on stages all over the world\n\nThat\u2019s where RED\u2019s latest effort comes from. Since their last release, 2015\u2019s OF BEAUTY AND RAGE, the trio sought to write what can actually be considered a live album that happened to be recorded in a studio.\n\n\u201cWe pay a lot more attention to what a song will do onstage,\u201d Randy says. \u201cInstead of\nwasting time writing songs that we probably wouldn't play live on a stage, songs that wouldn't be fun enough or exciting enough for an audience, we're getting more tracks that we can play live than we have in the past, anticipating where we live, and that's on the road.\u201d\n\nThe road goes on \u2026 so does RED \u2026 and so does the desire for relevance, for living life.\n\n\u201cLike in every other record, we want to be here in ten years. We're asking ourselves that question now - if we aren't going to be here in ten years, what are people going to think about our music? Our music is going to be out there, certainly. However long we're here on Earth, the music's going to be available for people to listen to, but we're not going to be available to tour and write new songs.\u201d\n\nAs \u201cStill Alive,\u201d GONE\u2019s second track, asks:\n\n\u201cIs this where the story ends?\nAre we just beginning?\nLive the lie and we\u2019ll pretend\nWe\u2019re fighting for something\nIf I lose the world I know\nIf the night, it comes for me\nIf tomorrow fades\nAnd nothing matters\n\nI am still alive (what\u2019s it all for?)\nI am still alive (what\u2019s it all for?)\n\nRED may not know where their music will take them or what opportunities await, but one thing is certain - the band\u2019s collective and individual reminder of hope adds to a substantial legacy that will resonate long after they\u2014after all of us\u2014are gone, thanks to the universal relevance of their epic melodies and passionate message.\n\n\u201cWe know where to go, and we're trying to point people in the direction where they're not relying so much on themselves and their friends,\u201d Randy says. \u201cIt's more about realizing that we're all different but we're all the same.\u201d\n\nABOUT RED: The band has sold more than 1.5 million albums collectively with OF BEAUTY AND RAGE, RELEASE THE PANIC, UNTIL WE HAVE FACES, INNOCENCE & INSTINCT, and END OF SILENCE.

Even though the duo comprised of Doctur Dot and Johnny Venus are more than capable of pulling off such feats, they are here to instill something simpler. Something bigger. Something that you, the listener, the fan, the artist, the critic may not even realize that you need yet:\n\nFreedom to be yourself.\n\nThat freedom is what attracted the duo to each other when they were students at Southwest Atlanta\u2019s storied Benjamin E. Mays High School. Roaming the same hallways that produced all four members of Goodie Mob decades before them, Earthgang first met each other during an emergency evacuation. After seeing that they had similar tastes in music ranging from Madonna to Madlib, their relationship blossomed from casual conversations about rap to forming a group of their own. But before they even recorded their first project together, they already found themselves hitting the road as they each enrolled at prestigious HBCU Hampton University in Virginia. Though both of them attended the college on academic scholarships with Dot majoring in Psychology and Venus studying to be an architect, they found themselves using the campus as their recording studio.\n\nThe work paid off as Earthgang\u2019s first two projects, 2010\u2019s The Better Party and 2011\u2019s Mad Men landed them shows on both ends of the country at the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival and Stanford University\u2019s Blackfest. Their follow-up mixtape Good News, backed by energetic live shows, boosted their profile in Atlanta\u2019s congested indie rap scene, but it was their ambitious 2012 debut album Shallow Graves For Toys that captured nationwide attention and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. The wide-ranging project displayed their ability to create with acoustic folk singers like Marian Mereba as well as chest-thumping declarations with producers 808 Mafia (Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka Flame) with Noisey calling it \u201cone of the most well thought-out releases of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur projects are more conceptual than just making songs,\u201d insists Doctur Dot, whose handle is based off his childhood nickname \u201cDoc,\u201d which he earned for always seeming to have answers for everything. \u201cWe are making ourselves vulnerable to the world through our music. Most people don\u2019t allow themselves to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe set out to make the best music that feels the best to us,\u201d adds Johnny Venus, whose name derives from his astrological sign Libra, but challenges the common perception of the symbol by making it asexual. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural synergy for us. We don\u2019t just try to make explosions happen.\u201d\n\nEarthgang\u2019s most recent offering Torba did just that as they showcased their versatility alongside the likes of both Mac Miller and OG Maco over production that ranged from hazy to urgent. That release, coupled with successful tours opening for Ab Soul and Fashawn, Earthgang took another step towards becoming one of the most unique voices in Hip Hop today. Their upcoming album Strays With Rabies (released through their Spillage Village imprint) aims to put their evolving songwriting skills at the forefront after already proving their rap skills to be far above average.\n\nWith a lyrical spectrum that has graduated from \u201choping your mama lose her temper\u201d on Mad Men to \u201cseeing the whole world with my eyes closed\u201d on Torba, Earthgang is rapidly growing into a musical force that will liberate listeners from all walks of life.

The resulting union yields an ever-evolving fusion of alternative R&B and neo-soul. For as singular as each personality may be, they all participate equally in writing, producing, tracking, and mixing their records, collaborating as true equal partners. Not only do they create as a unit, but they also evolve, grow, and transform as one.\n\u201cOur chemistry as writers was pretty instantaneous from the start,\u201d explains Andris. \u201cThe first tune we came up with, we all sat on a piano bench together and wrote as a unit. Nowadays, each of us has our own studio setup and are constantly making beats and writing songs on our own. We\u2019ll often send each other emails of beats we made and then get together to expand them into full songs. We have so much trust in each other during the writing process.\u201d\nAs Moonchild, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts\u2014never more so than on their fourth full-length, Little Ghost [Entertainment One].\nAfter that first shared piano bench session at the University of Southern California, the group unveiled their debut Be Free in 2012. Please Rewind followed three years later, and 2017\u2019s Voyager saw them ascend to new critical peaks. NPR Music touted the record among, \u201cFive R&B Albums You Slept On In 2017,\u201d and JAZZ FM named them \u201cSoul Act of the Year\u201d for 2018. \u201cCure\u201d toppled 8 million Spotify streams, and \u201cThe List\u201d exceeded 7 million plays on Youtube.\nAlong the way, the trio performed headline shows everywhere from the United States and Europe to Asia, and supported other tours for the likes of The Internet, Kamasi Washington, and more. As they began writing and recording Little Ghost in 2018, the individual progression of each musician informed and elevated the creative process. While laying down tracks at a Lake Arrowhead retreat, Andris dove further into the guitar, incorporating it at the core of the new music.\n\u201cThe three of us are always experimenting with new programs and gear and trying to improve our craft individually,\u201d he goes on. \u201cI\u2019ve been so into guitar, so that\u2019s a big shift from previous Moonchild albums. The acoustic and ukulele really expanded our sound. The keyboard-driven sounds and horns are still there, but they\u2019re intertwined with guitar.\u201d\n\u201cThe evolution connects to the title,\u201d adds Amber. \u201cAt the end of a star\u2019s life, the gas expands into space and leaves a really beautiful nebula, and there is one up there called Little Ghost. We thought it was a cool concept of expansion, mirroring what we were doing as a group.\u201d\nThe first single \u201cToo Much to Ask\u201d illuminates that expansion. Andris pairs an electric piano patch with the guitar and ukulele over a skittering groove as Amber\u2019s raspy delivery rolls from a near-whisper to a soulful swoon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about realizing you\u2019re in a relationship with someone who\u2019s halfway out the door - who doesn\u2019t care like you do,\u201d she says. \u201cOften you come to that realization one hint at a time, with the all little things they don\u2019t do.\u201d\nEliciting a raucous reaction by playing horns together live, the band \u201cincorporated more horns than ever before,\u201d according to Max. Not only do horn solos blare and bounce through \u201cMoney\u201d and \u201cCome Over,\u201d but they kickstart the momentum on the opener \u201cWise Women\u201d where jazz-y shakers and hi-hats give way to a breathy clarion call for female empowerment as Amber sings, \u201cGo on and prove them wrong.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Wise Women\u2019 is just about making things happen for yourself and not waiting for opportunities to come,\u201d she elaborates.\nUkulele and piano converge for a dreamy dynamic on \u201cThe Other Side,\u201d while everything concludes on the sweeping string outro of \u201cStill Wonder.\u201d It serves as a cinematic send-off befitting of the 14-track journey.\n\u201cWriting together is ultimately therapeutic,\u201d Amber leaves off. \u201cI hope we give listeners something they can relate to and find comfort in. It\u2019s what music does for us.\u201d\n\u201cWe were obsessed with crafting this record,\u201d concludes Max. \u201cIt got us really excited every day. Maybe it can inspire others to pursue their own art or anything that makes them feel good.\u201d\n\nFor more information:\n\nhttp://www.thisismoonchild.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thisismoonchild\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/thisismoonchild", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "476 Castro St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Kally Price", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.435403, 37.761304], "Date": "Tue Nov 12 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Blush!

The death place of Graham Parsons and birth place of many artistic visions! Just a couple hours away from Los Angeles, Annachristie has been writing and recording her newest EP \"Sibling Rivalry\" while soaking up the mountain views. She was born outside of Philadelphia, PA in a suburb called Downingtown some might know as home of the blob diner. Annachristie grew up in a two bedroom red brick house with 7 home-schooled siblings, ironically just a couple blocks away from an elementary school. As the kids would walk home from school, she and her brothers and sisters would sing songs, do cartwheels, ballet and try to sell toys to the other kids. Her father Dennis Sadler (founder of Songwriter's Conspiracy) supported all 8 children as an antique dealer. Annachristie followed in his footsteps in the trade of buying and selling in order to dedicate more time to her real passion, music. Annachristie is musically emerging from a life long project with her sisters, Sisters3 who successfully released \"Coruscate at the Meadow Gate\" (2012 NYC release recorded at The Cutting Room) under Modern Vintage Recordings. They also recorded \"Star Spangled\" (2009) in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in the same church Feist had recorded her early albums. The latest, light-hearted release \"Sibling Rivalry\" will be her fourth release to date and her first solo release since her premiere album \"Elixer for the Human Heart\" (2005). Currently, she is in the thick of booking a release tour both in the USA, as well as in Europe. She has shared the stage with artists such as Amos Lee, First Aid-Kit, Langhorn Slim, and Hoots and Hellmouth. As luck or hard work would have it. Annachristie and Sisters3 sang all the backup vocals for Sharon Little on her tour with Alison Krauss and Robert Plant. She has made appearances on Mountain Stage, NBC Ten Show, Good Morning New York, Philadelphia Folk Festival and Bliss Fest. She is as hard working as a donkey and as magical as a unicorn. Annachristie has had a long romance singing in the subways of NYC sharing her music with the transient city traveling relentlessly with a vigor for adventure that you can taste when she sings.

Audiences first properly experienced her unbridled emotional artistry on the 2016 debut single \u201cIssues.\u201d Certified RIAA double-platinum stateside, it crossed worldwide consumption of 5 million in less than six months and became \u201cthe best-selling song by a new artist released in 2017\u201d\u2014according to Nielsen Music\u2014as well as the \u201chighest on-demand audio streaming song by a new artist released in 2017.\u201d That same honesty also defines her very first \u201cmini-album,\u201d Nervous System [Republic Records]. With these seven tracks, she fortifies her emotional bond with millions of listeners everywhere.\n\n\u201cA lot of my songs have to do with the nervous system and things that are stimulated by touch and emotion,\u201d she explains. \u201cOne day, the title just popped into my head. It made sense with how emotional the songs I\u2019ve written are and who I am. Of course, I personally am a fucking nervous system as well, so there\u2019s that,\u201d she laughs.\n\nAs \u201cIssues\u201d achieved stratospheric success, she quietly assembled what would become the \u201cmini-album,\u201d writing and producing alongside frequent collaborators such as Mattman & Robin [Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, Hailee Steinfeld], Justin Tranter [Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez], and more in L.A. In addition to \u201cIssues,\u201d the follow-up single \u201cUh Huh\u201d\u2014which earned early praise from Time, V Magazine, and many others\u2014paved the way for the release of Nervous System. Slipping from acoustic guitar into a rush of electronic production and a chantable chorus, the track captures a fleeting and fiery moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about wanting the person you want to make the move,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t yet, so you\u2019re like, \u2018Shit, should I just do it myself?\u2019 You don\u2019t know how he feels though. It\u2019s this weird tension. When that move does happen, it\u2019s the most magical and pure feeling in the world. That\u2019s something we can all relate to.\u201d\n\nDelicate piano and skittering synths entwine with her soulful delivery on \u201cWorst In Me.\u201d Originally culled from a voice note on her phone, the song sees Julia open up about a failed relationship.\n\n\u201cI wrote it about my ex-boyfriend,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt chronicles our downfall and why we couldn\u2019t work. Sometimes people are so afraid of something really good that they sabotage the relationship because they think it can\u2019t be real. All of these little tiny things manifest into problems. You lose the bigger picture, which is that you love each other and genuinely care.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, off-beat percussion drives \u201cMake It Up To You\u201d where she candidly confesses, \u201cI wish I could be the tender stable girl that you want\u2014but I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nFurther exploring the dissolution of this pivotal relationship in her life, \u201cJust Do It\u201d discusses what the artist calls, \u201cThe moment you\u2019re on the verge of a breakup, but just can\u2019t end it.\u201d\n\nThe clever and coy \u201cPink\u201d showcases another side of Nervous System and Julia. Tempering a rich sonic backdrop with lyrical double entendre, you might find yourself smiling after each verse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty self-explanatory,\u201d she grins. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe it without it sounding extremely sexual!\u201d\n\nNervous System concludes with \u201cDon\u2019t Wanna Think.\u201d Performed on piano and written solely by Julia, it stands out as a shining finale, conveying raw and real emotion over each chord between sips of tequila.\n\n\u201cI wrote that one alone,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAs you can see, my ex and I had a very toxic relationship. I was at the piano drinking tequila at Henson Studios in Hollywood. It\u2019s going to sound crazy, but sometimes I feel like I write my future. I write about things as if they\u2019re going to happen. When they happen, it\u2019s a completely different perspective. What you hear is just me at the piano singing and crying. It\u2019s the most special song I\u2019ve written. I can\u2019t wait for everyone to hear it.\u201d\n\nNervous System continues a tradition of honesty that Julia began as one of pop music\u2019s most in-demand songwriters. Emerging in 2013, she solidified herself as a prolific force, co-writing a string of Billboard Hot 100 hits alongside Tranter, including smashes like Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cSorry,\u201d Nick Jonas ft. Tove Lo \u201cClose,\u201d Selena Gomez\u2019s \u201cGood for You\u201d [feat. A$AP Rocky] & \u201cHands To Myself,\u201d Hailee Steinfeld \u201cLove Myself,\u201d Britney Spears \u201cSlumber Party,\u201d Gwen Stefani \u201cUsed To Love You\u201d and, most recently, Selena Gomez\u2019s \u201cBad Liar,\u201d Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cDive,\u201d and John Legend\u2019s \u201cSurefire.\u201d The cumulative worldwide stream count for songs she has co-written exceeds 10 billion to date.\n\nIn the end, Julia will always connect by just being herself. Nervous System is proof.\n\n\u201cI hope people can find a little bit of themselves in the music,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing fake about this. Every word is part of my life. I hope you can find your own perspective in it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2174 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Black Belt Eagle Scout", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9153055.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.430418, 37.766622], "Date": "Wed Nov 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Du Nord", "moreBioInfo": "Released in September of 2018, Mother of My Children was the debut album from Black Belt Eagle Scout, the recording project of Katherine Paul.

They are especially involved in performing and working for venues within the local experimental music scene. They\u2019re constant collaborators and have recorded and toured with homegrown acts as varied as Tweedy, Whitney, Chance The Rapper and Twin Peaks.\n\nCunningham and Stewart are multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriters with a penchant for two instruments in particular. \"The band started because we knew we could sing well together and we wanted to make some noise with the guitar,\u201d says Cunningham. Stewart elaborates, \u201cSima and I are both trained classical pianists and we know many of the sonic spaces keyboards have to offer. Since we were interested in experimenting and creating something different from what we had both done in the past, we chose guitar as our outlet for this band. We wanted to create both new and uncomfortable parameters for ourselves to force us into a different creative space.\u201d These guitar-heavy experiments are sometimes earthy and resounding, at other times shimmering and buzzing\u2014swirling around the duo's expertly crafted vocals while creating a chaotic bed of harmony. Cunningham's smoky alto complements Stewart's higher-register croon, all underpinned by the restrained yet highly inventive polyrhythmic percussion of drummer Matt Carroll. Think Amber Coffman and Angel Deradoorian-era Dirty Projectors.\n\nEnlisting fellow Chicago cohorts Doug McCombs (Tortoise), Ken Vandermark and cellist Tomeka Reid, OHMME recorded and self-produced Parts from Cunningham\u2019s Logan Square home studio, Fox Hall. With Parts, OHMME \"wanted to capture a moment in time instead of something perfect.\u201d The results are thrilling: from the pure pop opening track \u201cIcon\u201d to the candied sludge of \"Peach\" to the skipping rhythms of \"Parts\" and the dusky closer \"Walk Me,\" Parts draws from influences as diverse as Kate Bush and Brian Eno's Here Come the Warm Jets to jazz and improvisational music, making for an electric debut listening experience.\n\nThis range from sweetly shiny 2-minute hypnotic bangers to woozy and sprawling 7-minute long tracks boasting moodily atmospheric wafting guitars and piercing feedback shows a band colliding thoughtfulness and creative ingenuity to produce music as unique as it is earworm-worthy.

Evidence is that rapper...and producer, as well as the newest signee to Rhymesayers Entertainment. But for many, the Venice-native will always be known by the title of his critically-lauded solo debut, The Weatherman.\n\n\"When some people freestyle, they say 'I'll be on the mic' or 'When i flow like this'\u2014everyone has a crutch\u2014and I guess that the easiest thing for me to incorporate was some kind of tornado or hurricane...or maybe it's just all the syllables and the titles with weather,\" Evidence says, laughing. \"I can't even stay away from it.\"\n\nBut it's also a bigger idea that turns LA's stereotypes on their heads. Yeah, it's almost always sunny and there's a whole lot of gangster rap, but it does occasionally rain in the city of angels and the underground hip-hop scene is a thriving one. It was there that Evidence made his name, as part of the legendary trio Dilated Peoples, alongside Rakaa Iriscience and DJ Babu. Starting with The Platform in 2000, the group released four well received albums that contained several hit singles, including the Kanye West assisted smash \"This Way.\"\n\nHowever, Evidence wanted more and after seeing his name appear on a flyer as \"Evidence of Dilated Peoples,\" he knew that he wanted his to be a brand of its own, saying \"No one calls Ghostface Ghostface Killah of Wu-Tang...and that's a tribute to him as an individual artist.\" Despite winning a GRAMMY for co-production on Kanye's College Dropout and two JUNO's for his work with Swollen Members, Evidence wasn't yet a solo name to be recognized.\n\nThen in 2007, Evidence released The Weatherman LP, one of the most commercially and critically successful underground rap albums of the year. A solo effort ripe with introspection that ran the gamut from all his haters to the tragic passing of his mother, it was the album his fans were waiting for. With a foundation of sample-based hip-hop classicism (something that remains important to Evidence today), his debut wove together towering bangers like \"Mr. Slow Flow\" and uplifting cuts like \"Chase the Clouds Away.\" He then released The Layover EP on Decon Records and The Layover Mixtape with DJ Skee in 2008\u2014showing marked improvement in his lyrical style\u2014and he's been touring ever since.\n\nEvidence's long-awaited sophomore offering, Cats & Dogs, will be released on Rhymesayers Entertainment. The album reunites the powerhouse production team from The Weatherman\u2014including long-time friend and collaborator Alchemist, Dr. Dre-protog\u00e9 DJ Kalil, DJ Babu, and Evidence himself. Cats & Dogs promises to be an expansion of the Evidence brand as the artist pushes his own boundaries...without losing the qualities that he has built his foundation on.\n\n\"I love to sell my own merch, I love to look someone in the eye and actually listen to the story they have about my music, I love to respond to people on MySpace or Twitter,\" Evidence says. \"It's not for my ego, but yo, this is why I do this shit.\" And that commitment to his fans is returned 10-fold in their commitment to him, as well as something he saw in the stable of artists at Rhymesayers. Perhaps none more than label-head Slug, who guested on \"Line of Scrimmage\" from The Weatherman LP, and was instrumental in bringing Evidence to the Minneapolis-based indie behemoth.\n\n\"Leadership, personality and lifestyle are selling more music than the actual music. It's a person who has talent and the willingness to work at it and the social skills and accessibility to their fans and understanding of the bigger picture that makes it...and a lot of artists on Rhymesayers have cracked that code.\"\n\nAs has Evidence. He doesn't like using the word \"fan\" to describe the street wear hoodied and 59/50 fitted kids who come to his shows because he truly understands the lifestyle (and is probably wearing the same brands, too). \"Brother Ali would joke on tour that all my fans dressed the same as each other...and me,\" Evidence laughs. From the threads to the weed to the reverence for hip-hop's history, the people who get their vinyl copy of The Platform autographed share a great deal with Evidence the artist, but also Michael Perretta the person.\n\nSo with all that love, what's the weatherman forecasting for 2010? Dilated Peoples is hard at work on their fifth full-length, Directors of Photography, and Ev is deep in the studio with The Alchemist for their anticipated collaboration, Stepbrothers. Sounds like another year of unparalleled grind...something as predictable as sunshine in LA.

They have fans in high places too: Nasa used their music to wake the crew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour.\n\nCGT's lineup is truly the sum of its distinct parts: A Utah native now residing in Los Angeles, Paul Richards immersed himself in rock, blues, jazz, and folk during his early days and while attending The University of Utah\u2019s jazz guitar program. Bert Lams, originally from Belgium, graduated from the prestigious Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels, specializing in classical guitar. Tokyo-born Hideyo Moriya began his guitar journey with surf music and British rock, before relocating to Boston to study at Berklee.\n\nAll three felt the call to push themselves to the limit by enrolling in Robert Fripp\u2019s challenging Guitar Craft courses, where they first met in 1987. They went on to tour together as part of Fripp\u2019s League of Crafty Guitarists, before forming the California Guitar Trio in Los Angeles four years later.\n\nRecently, the trio expanded its collaborative possibilities by working within a six-guitar format with the Montreal Guitar Trio. During these groundbreaking, highly-entertaining shows, the acts perform inventive arrangements of each other\u2019s repertoire, and new music for guitar sextet.\n\n26 years and 1,800+ gigs later, the CGT remains intensely committed to explore, evolve and communicate a wide-ranging musical worldview.\n\n- By Anil Prasad", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "412 14th St, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Street Fight WCRS", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9575831.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.270302, 37.804256], "Date": "Wed Nov 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-13", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Golden Bull Bar", "moreBioInfo": "The #1 Anarcho-comedy radio show on any station across the nation.

As it flows and grooves along, the collection artfully reveals an artist perfectly comfortable in his own skin. No longer on a quest to discover his musical identity, Standring has fully arrived at a place where he can declare, \u201cThis is what I want to say, and this is who I am!\u201d\nIf he seems to be defiantly accentuating the positive, it's by design. One of the creative breakthroughs putting a new spring in his step is taking the opportunity, after years of thoughtful contemplation, to re-imagine his favorite song of all time, Brian Wilson's epic Beach Boys classic \"God Only Knows,\" and bring it into a lush, atmospheric soundscape all his own. He\u2019s also ensembling with a batch of his favorite handpicked musicians, including bassists Andre Berry, Jimmy Haslip and Roberto Vally, and drummers Chris Coleman (Prince, David Sanborn), and Dave Karasony. Helping him create the perfect retro soul flavors throughout are some of the world\u2019s premiere keyboardists, including longtime collaborator Rodney Lee, Mitchel Forman and John Novello. Famed tenor saxophonist Pete Christlieb fuels the playful horn section hook of \u201cDo Not Adjust Your Set,\u201d which also features a high energy solo by saxman Brandon Fields.\n\u201cOverall, Sunlight\u2019s got a joyful, upbeat vibe\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a dark record in any way, although the last track \u2018The Principle of Pleasure\u2019 gets a little intense. I wanted to find some kind of word that described the overall feeling of the album, and despite the diversity from track to track, thought \u2018Sunlight\u2019 captured the positivity and optimism of the music perfectly. It\u2019s got an upbeat spirit about it. It probably wasn\u2019t conscious, but maybe deep down I was being reactionary, calling out and taking a stand against the darkness of these times. For a lot of people, music can be a bright spot no matter what\u2019s going on with them personally and in the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Inhaler", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Wed Nov 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Blossoms"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Drew Southern Band", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Wed Nov 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Drew Southern Band at Boom Boom Room: Couches and cocktails complement a blues and funk boogie, which makes shaking it on the checkerboard dance floor an old-fashioned must.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "New Band featuring award winning, world class, master jazz artists:\n\nEdward Simon-piano\nScott Colley-bass\nBrian Blade-drums\n\nNew jazz trio Steel House is an absorbingly spirited band featuring three award winning world class master jazz artists.

No bell bottoms, wizard sleeves, or hip huggers for this crew. It\u2019s a barrage of head-bobbing, air-guitaring, hip-shaking, blues-driven rock as delivered by the bastards of rock & roll. With equal appeal to the fuzz-box mercenaries, stoner-rockers safety meeting in a \u201974 Chevy van, and horns-thrusting metalheads pressed against the stage, this band refuses to conform or brandish a manufactured label. Showing the maturity and confidence to explore the full gamut of their influences and what inspires them internally, ZED is set to offer their third full-length album \u201cTrouble In Eden\u201d with an August 26th release date on Ripple Music. \u201cTrouble In Eden\u201d is a literal collection of blood, sweat, and tears crafted together with raw, personal, relative lyrical content. Tales touching on religious-fueled tragedy, societal reflection, struggles with mental anguish, loss, and perseverance, this album is one for all to relate to. Drop the needle, push play, crank the knob, push the volume high and prepare to be intoxicated by the potion ZED is offering. \u2013 Dylan Dominguez-Waltz Blasting onto the San Francisco Bay Area rock scene in 2007, ZED quickly made a name for themselves with their crushing live shows and incessant grooves. Having played together in various projects since 1998, including releasing an album with the band Stitch for Prosthetic/Metal Blade Records, Guitarist/Vocalist Peter Sattari, drummer Rich Harris and bassist Mark Aceves joined up with guitar wizard Greg Lopes to create a sound that was uniquely their own, a sound whose sole purpose was to rock, with no concern for genres, labels, classifications or rules. Drawing from their varied influences ranging from classic \u201970s rock, punk/hardcore, metal and old school funk, ZED writes music that grabs you, throws you around and grooves you all at once. The band has been likened to \u201ca pissed off Led Zeppelin with Chris Cornell meets Ian Astbury on vocals,\u201d ZED writes songs that linger in your head long after you listen to them. ZED independently released their sophomore album Desperation Blues in May of 2013, which garnered critical acclaim as well as charting on CMJ throughout the summer. Supporting the album up and down the west coast, ZED has played consistently through the fall of 2014 when they began focusing on writing their follow up to Desperation Blues, Trouble In Eden, which is also their debut for Ripple Music. ZED is excited and proud to be a part of the Ripple Music family and look forward to making heads bob and asses shake in 2016 and beyond. ZED is Heavy. ZED is Heavier.

They toured the country as part of their father\u2019s band, Muzzie Braun and the Boys, as children. They performed on The Tonight Show twice while sharing the stages with the likes of Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell and Merle Haggard. Their father taught his sons a professional ethic \u2013 integrity, persistence, hard work and professionalism \u2013 honed over three generations. Still teenagers, they moved to Bend, Oregon, to start their own band and soon after met drummer Jay Nazz.\n\nThe band took its name from the legend of Ned Kelly, the Australian highwayman, and moved to Austin in the autumn of 1996, where they carved a niche of their own. They evolved, adding David Abetya, a graduate of the Berklee School of Music, on lead guitar in 2000. Kansas-bred bassist Joe Miller -- who had grown up on a family farm before becoming a broadcaster at his college radio station and migrating to Austin \u2013 signed on 2012.\n\nThey listened, watched and interacted with the creative dynamos of the outlaw country scene \u2013 Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, Billy Joe Shaver, Guy Clark and others \u2013 and joined them in a redefinition of what contemporary country music had become. Theirs was gritty, hard-edged, uncompromising and convincing. They turned country music real again.\n\nReckless Kelly\u2019s string of critically acclaimed albums\u2013 set a standard of reliable excellence and commitment to an instinctive vision of Americana. No band exemplifies the broad genre better.\n\nThe group\u2019s new album, Sunset Motel, is, like all its predecessors, distinctive in its own way while true to form. Self-produced, self- released on their own record label, No Big Deal Records, and\n\nrecorded in Austin\u2019s renowned Arlyn Studios (where Millican was made two decades ago) and mixed by Jim Scott (Rolling Stones, Dixie Chicks, Tom Petty, Sting, Roger Daltrey, Crowded House, et al.), it reflects Reckless Kelly\u2019s attention to craft and continuity.\n\nReckless Kelly is a great band with an apt name.

After spinning at a number of clubs in Chicago\u2019s underground hip-hop scene before being able to legally drink, Toure relocated to Tallahassee, Florida to attend college.

Equally influenced by his Brazilian roots and southern U.S. upbringing, the 28 year old Nashville native's work was featured in Apple's \"What Will Your Verse Be\" series of iPad commercials, called \"brilliant\" by music\u2019s premier aficionado, Questlove, and earned praise from national/global outlets such as The Guardian, Huffington Post, The LA Times, Vulture, NPR, BBC, MTV, BET, REVOLTtv, EBONY,VIBE, XXL, THE SOURCE, OKAYPLAYER, Wax Poetic, Gizmodo and HipHopDX to name a few.\n\n\n\nThe son of renowned Jazz trumpeter, Gary \u201cEl Buho\u201d Gazaway, Amerigo\u2019s thematic documentary-like concept albums uses found interview sound-bites, live performances, and original multi-track stems to help narrate and craft his combined artists' stories. Finding his first success with 2011's Fela Kuti/De La Soul pairing \"Fela Soul,\" the project went on to land on several year-end \"best of\" lists including NPR, Soul Train, and OKAYPLAYER. Following the release in 2012 with \"Bizarre Tribe: A Quest to the Pharcyde\", a concept that layered vocals of The Pharcyde over re-imagined productions sourced from the original Soul, Jazz, and Funk records ATCQ utilized to create their productions, Gazaway would later collaborate with The Pharcyde on their single \"Still Got Love\" and perform with the legendary group at SXSW.\n\n\n\nContinuing the theme of his previous work in 2014, the producer united Brooklyn rapper Yasiin Bey (FKA Mos Def) and soul legend Marvin Gaye for a dream collaboration aptly titled \"Yasiin Gaye\" (side one and side two.) Building the album\u2019s foundation from deconstructed samples of Gaye\u2019s Motown classics, Amerigo re-purposes the instrumentation into new productions with the familiar fervor of the original work.

The night we played Bonnaroo a couple years ago, I sat with my younger brother Sam, my wife Ellie, and a few other dear friends, reclining in plastic lawn chairs in the midnight Tennessee heat outside our tour bus, drinking wine and listening to music. After a decade of touring, (over 1700 shows) and making records, it\u2019s easy to forget the magic of music. We took turns introducing each other to new bands and artists, talking about our lives, our dreams, our failures. Music has always had a medicinal quality to me, and that\u2019s why I started writing songs and touring in the first place. I first needed the medicine when I was seventeen. I lost a brother that summer, 1999. He was a great kid, lived life from the view of a wheelchair, and was gone without warning a few days before his 14th birthday. I took lots of medicine, from Radiohead and Bob Dylan, from Pearl Jam and Otis Redding, from Bob Marley to the Temptations, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to Rage Against the Machine. I played the guitar in my bedroom, learned songs I loved, sang along in my car alone or with a friend. A year later I went to college in Knoxville and I became an addict. I was introduced to the medicine of Patty Griffin, Whiskeytown, Springsteen, Tom Waits, the Jayhawks, Wilco, Beck and hundreds more that could fill pages. I went and saw their shows and played their records over and over and over. The honesty, the intellect, the stories, the raw emotion, the rhythm, the vulnerability; it all made me feel like I was not alone. Music was a way of saying, \u201cme too,\u201da way of finding hope and meaning in the sorrow and confusion of life. Somewhere in those late college years, I started writing songs, at first feeble attempts, but it grew and grew, and I got better and better. I booked shows, I made myself vulnerable and stood onstage and sang earnest songs about love and joy, pain and tragedy. I convinced myself that making medicine was something I could take a swing at. After graduating, over a cup of coffee, I asked my dentist father what he thought about my dream, and he asked me one question, \u201cAre you going to work hard at that?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d I replied. \u201cWell let\u2019s go to the guitar shop and I\u2019ll buy you the best one I can afford.\u201d I hit the road, and I hit it hard. I found a band of agile, competent musicians whose musical library is vast and deep and demanding. Along the way, I married the girl I always wanted. She quit her teaching job and joined the band, toured with us for seven great years. We made several records, and spent the majority of the last decade on the road. You may have heard our music on TV. We\u2019ve had our songs on dozens of shows like Nashville, Parenthood, How I Met Your Mother. We have toured with artists like the Avett Brothers, John Hiatt, Needtobreathe, and a host of other kindred souls. We have sold out our own shows in places from Chicago to Austin, LA to New York, London to Denver, on stages we never dreamed we would play, and selling over 100,000 records in the process, all while staying independent. Our music is simple and heartfelt, built to inhabit people\u2019s day to day lives, like so many of the records I have loved over the long haul in my own life. Medicine is by far the best music we have ever made. When I played it for a respected friend, I asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d The response was, \u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s always been there.\u201d We recorded the whole album in eight days, co-produced by the band and Joe Pisapia (Ben Folds, KD Lang, Guster, Josh Rouse) at Joe\u2019s Middletree Studios, in East Nashville, about a mile from my house. We recorded one song at a time, until it was finished. No studio tricks, just me and a great band working together, creating, having fun, embracing the sorrow. It\u2019s always been about the song for us, a community of musicians surrounding that song and bringing it life, trying to make it sound like it has always been there.\nThe twelve songs on Medicine deal with loyalty, hardship, marriage, friendship, feeling like an outsider, and wrestling with God. \u201cYou\u2019ll Always Be My Girl\u201d is a love song to my bride Ellie, who after eight years on the road with us, is stepping away from the band. I came up with the first line when I was playing with our daughter Emmylou before putting her to bed. I wasn\u2019t trying to write a song, just entertaining her and I came up with the first line \u2013\u2018 from the start of spring to the autumn leaves, and the summers and winters between...\u201d After tucking her in, I dashed off the rest of the song in 45 minutes. It was the night before we went into the studio for the last time. When Ellie got home, I played it for her. She loved it, and we cried together for a moment and celebrated what we\u2019ve got and what we\u2019re grateful for. The next day, I taught it to the band, and we recorded the 24-hour-old song in one take. Nathan Dugger on piano, Rich Brinsfield on upright bass and me singing, just sitting in a circle. That ethos embodies the whole experience of making this record. \u201cShine Like Lightning\u201dis a song about us being an underdog band, never embraced by the powers of radio, major labels, large corporate sponsorships, and in light of that we have a healthy chip on our shoulder. But our music making has brought us, and our fans, a lot of happiness, it seems. This is an ode to ten years of doing it our own way, on our own terms, in spite of the roadblocks of cynicism and criticism, those who would \u201ctake something beautiful and make it feel small.\u201dIt\u2019s an anthem for our band and our fans, that we are going to \u201cShine Like Lightning!\u201d critics and cynics be damned. Breaking with my previous autobiographical songwriting bent, I wrote songs like \u201cHeartbreak\u201d and \u201cSister Brothers,\u201d based on the experiences of friends instead. Elsewhere, \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d looks back on the nostalgia and loss of a teenage romance. The grooving, call-and-response \u201cHere We Go\u201d was inspired by that particular night shared with friends at Bonnaroo. Medicine closes with\u201cWhen It\u2019 s All Said and Done.\u201dIt\u2019s about questioning whether God is real and whether he cares about us or not ... and not walking away from that, but holding on to it like you\u2019re hanging on to the side of a cliff, and that\u2019s where I find myself at this point. More than anything else, Medicine is born out of the stories we are told. The email from a fan who was on the verge on suicide but our song gave her glimmer of hope to keep hanging on. The story by the bus of fans who danced their first dance to another one of our songs. The mom who sings our music to her kids before they go to sleep, begging for peace and health and a happy life. The people who dance in the back of the rock club and have a moment of joy in a world of suffering. We only hope to add to the soundtrack, in the same way that all those artists and bands have done for me. Making medicine, Music, it makes you feel good, makes you feel understood like you\u2019 re not alone, not a rolling stone, you\u2019 re not the only one on the road.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Jose, CA", "Artist": "Adam the Dancing Cowboy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9599607.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.8261, 37.2751], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rodeo Club", "moreBioInfo": "Professional Country DJ & Dance Instructor from the Bay Area.

Over four decades later, Ms. Lundy is celebrated throughout the world for her vocal artistry and is highly regarded for her jazz innovation.\n\nCurrently on the Afrasia Productions label, Carmen is releasing her 14th album in the Fall of 2014. Almost two years in the making, \u201cSoul To Soul\u201d consists of new original songs by Lundy, and a few very special collaborations. The album features legendary artists - specialists on their respective instruments - including Patrice Rushen, Geri Allen, Randy Brecker, Ada Rovatti, Warren Wolf, Bennie Maupin, harpist Carol Robbins, and Simphiwe Dana, a stunning South African vocalist and composer, among others.\n\nThe highly regarded 2012 release \u201cChanges\u201d (Afrasia Productions) is on several \u2018Top 10 Albums of 2012\u2019 lists, and continues to garner both critical and popular acclaim. Said James Nadal of All About Jazz, \u201cWith her release of Changes, veteran singer Carmen Lundy rises to that proverbial summit to enjoy the rarefied air of the chosen few.\u201d\n\nTerri Lyne Carrington\u2019s Mosaic Project - Grammy Winner for Best Jazz Vocal Album of 2011 - features the Carmen Lundy composition \u201cShow Me A Sign\u201d, with Ms. Lundy\u2019s original performance from the album \u201cSolamente\u201d reinvented on the arrangement.\n\nCarmen has had several Top Ten albums on JazzWeek (\u201cJazz and the New Songbook-Live at The Madrid\u201d, \u201cCome Home\u201d, and \u201cChanges\u201d) and a #3 spot on Billboard\u2019s Jazz Chart for 23 weeks with her debut album \u201cGood Morning Kiss\u201d. Among her other awards and recognitions, especially rewarding was Miami-Dade's County Office of the Mayor and Board of County Commissioners proclaiming January 25th \"Carmen Lundy Day\u201d, along with handing Ms. Lundy the keys to the City of Miami.\n\nHaving recorded more than thirteen albums as a leader, Carmen\u2019s far-reaching discography also includes performances and recordings with such musicians as brother and bassist Curtis Lundy, Ray Barretto, Kenny Barron, Bruce Hornsby, Mulgrew Miller, Terri Lyne Carrington, Kip Hanrahan, Courtney Pine, Roy Hargrove, Jimmy Cobb, Ron Carter, Marian McPartland, Regina Carter, Steve Turre, Geri Allen, Robert Glasper, Patrice Rushen and the late Kenny Kirkland. Ms. Lundy\u2019s 2005 release, the hugely successful \u201cJazz and The New Songbook-Live at The Madrid\u201d, features some of the jazz world\u2019s best known musicians paying tribute to Ms. Lundy.\n\nCarmen Lundy\u2019s work as a vocalist and composer has been critically acclaimed by The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Los Angeles Times, Variety, The Washington Post, Jazz Times, Jazziz, Downbeat and Vanity Fair among many others, as well as numerous foreign publications. Christopher Loudon of Jazz Times writes \u201cCarmen Lundy, as beautiful inside as out, has accomplished the near impossible for a jazz singer by maintaining a solid, successful, three-decade career while focusing largely on original, self-penned material.\u201d And Don Heckman of The Los Angeles Times \u2013 \u201cCarmen Lundy shows off her own, mature songbook. Her performance was the product of talent that has ripened fully. Lundy\u2019s far-ranging, fluidly mobile voice roved through and around the melodies, and her innate sense of theatricality illuminated every layer of drama in her story-driven songs.\u201d\n\nAs a composer, Ms. Lundy\u2019s catalogue numbers over 100 published songs, one of the few jazz vocalists in history to accomplish such a distinction, and has led to the first publication of the Carmen Lundy Songbook (2007). Her songs have been recorded by such artists as Kenny Barron (\"Quiet Times\"), Ernie Watts (\"At The End Of My Rope\"), and Straight Ahead (\"Never Gonna Let You Go\"). Officially endorsed by Neumann microphones, Carmen Lundy continues to compose and expand her vast catalogue.\n\nHer own recordings consist of 1985\u2019s \u201cGood Morning Kiss\u201d (CLR/Afrasia Productions), \u201cMoment To Moment\u201d (Arabesque/Afrasia Productions), \u201cNight And Day\u201d (CBS/SONY and re-issued by Afrasia in 2011), \u201cOld Devil Moon\u201d (JVC), \u201cSelf Portrait\u201d (JVC), \u201cSomething To Believe In\u201d and \u201cThis Is Carmen Lundy\u201d (both for Justin Time), \u201cJazz and The New Songbook \u2013 Live at The Madrid\u201d (2-disc set and DVD, Afrasia Productions), \u201cCome Home\u201d (Afrasia), \u201cSolamente\u201d and the 2012 release \u201cChanges\u201d (Afrasia Productions). Her newest recording \u201cSoul To Soul\u201d is almost 2 years in the making, and will be released in the Fall of 2014 on Afrasia Productions.\n\nA native of Miami, Florida, Carmen Lundy's path to being one of today's most talented, respected and sophisticated jazz singers began at age six, with her first piano lessons. She was deeply inspired by her mother who was then lead singer in the gospel group, The Apostolic Singers. Ms. Lundy attended The University of Miami as an Opera major, but soon discovered that jazz was where her talent really shone. While working steadily in the Miami Jazz scene, she graduated with a degree in Studio Music and Jazz - one of the first singers to do so. Lundy then moved to New York City in the spring of '78 and immediately began working in jazz circles throughout the Tri-State area, and from Harlem to Greenwich Village, quickly impressing the notoriously critical jazz cognoscenti and audiences alike. Esteemed critic Gary Giddins stated (in 1983), \"Jazz singing stopped regenerating itself about 20 years ago, and it's not hard to see why, so it's with some trepidation that I call your attention to an authentic young jazz singer named Carmen Lundy - she's got it all.\" Armed with a devoted following and critical kudos, the uncompromising Ms. Lundy continued to make waves, not just in North America, but in Asia and throughout the UK and Europe.\n\nTeaching, too, is an important activity for Ms Lundy; she's given Master Classes in Australia, Denmark, Russia, Japan, Switzerland, New York, Washington, D.C., Northern California, Los Angeles and other cities around the world. Since its inception in 1998, Lundy has and continues to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead Program at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., as Resident Clinician and guest artist. She has also worked with the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz as guest artist and clinician.\n\nMs. Lundy is also a gifted actress active in theatre. \"Acting,\" as she told Dr. Billy Taylor in 2006, \"helps me to get more comfortable and acquainted with the art of performance.\" She performed the lead role as Billie Holiday in the Off-Off Broadway play \"They Were All Gardenias\" by Lawrence Holder, as well as the lead role in the Broadway show, Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Ladies,\" and she made her television debut as the star of the CBS Pilot-Special \"Shangri-La Plaza\" in the role of Geneva, after which she relocated to Los Angeles, where she currently resides.\n\nIn addition to her recordings, Carmen Lundy has also composed and arranged for the Sonoton Music Library, the largest independent production music library in the world. Her music has been featured on such TV shows as \u201cMad Men\u201d, \u201cThe L Word\u201d, \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d, \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d, \u201cBaby Story\u201d, and many others; as well as Feature Films and Documentaries including \u201c9/11 \u2013 A Remembrance\u201d.\n\nCarmen Lundy is also a celebrated mixed media artist and painter, and her works have been exhibited in New York at The Jazz Gallery in Soho, at The Jazz Bakery in Los Angeles, and at a month-long exhibition at the Madrid Theatre in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\n\nwww.carmenlundy.com", "otherInfo": "Carmen Lundy While this engagement marks her San Francisco debut, Carmen Lundy is a bona fide jazz master who first made her mark more than three decades ago.

Not at gunpoint or anything\u2014the two had never even met\u2014but the effect of hearing the songwriting legend's music for the first time had an equally compelling effect on Luning, who was studying film scoring at the Berklee College of Music in Boston at the time. Now an accomplished artist in his own right, Luning is preparing to release his most dynamic and gripping collection to date, 'Restless,' and he can trace it all back to one fateful night that changed everything.\n\n\"A couple of friends invited me over to share some songs at their apartment, and that was the first time I'd ever really listened to Americana music or folk or country or whatever you want to call it,\" remembers Luning. \"They showed me John Prine, and it just resonated with me so much. I was like, 'Oh my god, this is what I have to do with my life.' I just figured it out in that moment.\"\n\nLuning dropped out of school almost immediately, moved back to his native California, and devoted himself to songwriting and performing. He worked his way up through open mics to large festival performances, piecing together a band to flesh out his songs along the way and hitting the road to tour with a fierce determination. His self-released debut album, 'Just Drop On By,' garnered acclaim from both critics and fellow musicians alike, with country megastar Keith Urban hailing Luning's \"staunch originality.\" Songs from the album landed numerous film and TV placements, most recently on NBC's 'Grimm,' and Luning's reputation for exhilarating live performances earned him dates with luminaries like Jackie Greene, Dave and Phil Alvin, and Elvin Bishop, along with a slew of festival performances up and down the West Coast.\n\nIf 'Just Drop On by' announced the arrival of a promising new talent, 'Restless' delivers on that potential and then some. Recorded under the guidance of engineer/producer Karl Derfler (Tom Waits, Dave Matthews) and with Luning's longtime live bandmates\u2014Ben Dubin (bass & harmonica), Linden Reed (drums), and Dave Sampson (guitar & mandolin)\u2014the album marks a major step forward, both sonically and emotionally.\n\n\"With the first record, I produced and engineered everything myself,\" explains Luning. \"I'd never worked with an outside producer before, so it was nerve-racking going into the studio with Karl for the first time, but it was just a perfect fit. It was like he knew what I wanted in my music before I even did, and he could push my performances where they needed to go and really take my music to another level.\"\n\nLuning and his band set up shop at the stunning Panoramic Studios in Stinson, California, crafting a darker, grittier vibe for the music and exploring a wider palette than ever before. While many of Luning's songs are inspired by the lives and stories of the men and women he's grown up with in California or met on the road, the lyrics are all filtered through his own unique perspective and reflect his remarkable personal journey. Perhaps no track fits that bill more directly than \"Driftin,'\" an infectious road warrior's anthem that find's Luning singing, \"I wanna keep on drifting like a rambling man.\"\n\n\"I had so much fun on tour going from place to place and playing to new people all the time and I got into the rhythm of it all, so when it ended and we came home I wasn't ready to stop,\" he explains. \"We pulled into Ben's house to unload our gear and I said, 'Ben, we're packing up and we're gonna go somewhere tomorrow right? We're gonna keep on going right?'\"\nMuch of the album is uptempo and exuberant\u2014\"Almost Sounds Like Laughing\" is a foot-stomping folk tune with the energy of a runaway train\u2014but Luning shows off his remarkable depth and range on some of the record's more restrained tracks, like the slow-burning \"Brother In Chains\" and delicate \"Gonna Forget About You,\" which finds him pulling his vocals back to an intimate near-whisper that conveys a world of heartache and regret. \"In Hell I Am\" started life as an acoustic blues on a resonator guitar before morphing into a fiery, electric rocker, while \"Bet It All On Black\" takes on a harder, Southern edge, with Luning repeating the mantra, \"Ain't no use in holding back.\"\n\n\"It's essentially about a person who's kind of carefree,\" he says, \"and they know that something might not be the best thing to do, but they're going all in with it anyway. They're just going for it, regardless of the outcome and any repercussions they might face.\"\nIf that sounds familiar, perhaps like the attitude of a man who might risk everything to drop out of school and move across the country to pursue a dream, it's no coincidence. With songs this good, it's a safe bet that a restless soul like David Luning is going to keep on traveling for a long time to come.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "400 Eddy St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Irwin Hall", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9173729.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414392, 37.78382], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "Genres: BAM, Jazz, Soul, Blues", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Black Cat", "moreBioInfo": "Irwin got his start at the age of 9 when he won a lottery in school and was gifted an alto saxophone.

Pe'a will take us on a journey through his life on his sophomore album with 8 Hawaiian original compositions and 4 classics with his renditions purely in Hawaiian, Contemporary and Soul.

Speech therapy in preschool didn\u2019t work for him,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cHe started with his first song at age four singing I Feel My Savior\u2019s Love.\u201d Leonard and Pe\u02bba\u2019s father Arthur (Ata) Pe\u02bba who comes from a musical family encouraged Kalani to take vocal lessons, choir, and entered him in numerous talent and karaoke competitions. Pe\u02bba at age 8 won numerous talent competitions statewide. At age 18 he won Brown Bags to Stardom and won first place in the National Association Teacher\u2019s of Singing Competition in Colorado/Wyoming chapter, placing first in the men\u2019s category in classical and musical divisions. Pe\u02bba won that competition while he attended Colorado Mesa University (Mesa State College) from 2001-2007 in Grand Junction, Colo. Pe\u02bba received his bachelor\u2019s degree in Mass Communications with an emphasis in public relations/news editorial and has background in early childhood education.

Pe\u02bba wears multiple hats and uses his proficiencies as a songwriter/music composer, singing anything from classical, musical, various ballads, R&B, soul and ultimately Hawaiian music. Pe\u02bba is proficient in publishing news and magazine articles. He worked for two years as an assignment editor at KJCT News 8, an ABC affiliate in Grand Junction. Pe\u02bba speaks Hawaiian for 28 years, starting Hawaiian immersion in third grade, he has taught Hawaiian culture with a science focus and created curriculum for almost 10 years. He was a preschool teacher at Kamehameha Preschools in Kona on the Big Island of Hawai'i for 4 years. He recently departed his position as a Hawaiian resource coordinator at Kamehameha Schools- Kealak\u016blia on Maui to pursue his music full-time.\n\n\nPe\u2019a was heavily involved in musicals and acting productions while being part of various popular Play Bills at Colorado Mesa University. He acted in Tony Award Winning musicals like George M, Return to the Forbidden Planet, Amahl & the Night Visitors and To Kill a Mockingbird. Kalani was affiliated with the Chamber and Concert choirs during his first three years in college. As a Freshman, Kalani took vocal lessons by Dr. Jack Delmore at Colorado Mesa University learning arias from Spanish tunes to Ball Hai and Les Miserable. In 2001, Kalani was encouraged by the faculty that he should enter in the National Association Teacher\u02bbs of Singing Competition for the Colorado/Wyoming Chapter. Pe\u2019a was able to persuade the judges like many of them who studied under Luciano Pavarotti, was engaged by Kalani\u02bbs classical performance in Spanish.\n\n\nOn Feb. 18, 2017, the Council of the County of Hawai\u2019i congratulated Kalani Pe\u2019a with a proclamation. The council said, \"Your Grammy award inspires members of the next generation to work hard, dream big, and express love and joy in all that they do. By sharing your gift with others, you will ensure the perpetuation of \u2018\u014clelo Hawai\u2019i.\u201d On the same date, Mayor Harry Kim of County of Hawai\u2019i awarded Kalani with a Proclamation. Kim said, \u201cPe\u2019a\u2019s victory is to further bring awareness and appreciation of Hawaiian language and culture far beyond our Hawaiian islands.\u201d On Oct. 8, 2017, Pe\u2019a was given a Commendation by Alan M. Arakawa, Mayor, County of Maui. \u201cYou are to be commended for your hard work and dedication in perpetuating the Hawaiian culture through your musical artistry.

He has performed at sold out shows in Hawai\u2019i, Japan, and the West Coast of USA and immediately gave himself an international recognition for his wide vocal range being a Tenor, his incredible stage presence and concert productions.\n\nHawaiian Airlines Hana Hou Magazine said, \u201cFor this acceptance speech he spoke completely in Hawaiian acknowledging his people, his l\u0101hui Hawai\u2019i. He was effusive in his praise of the culture and in encouraging Hawaiians to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.\u201d According to Hawai\u2019i Magazine, \u201cKalani Pe\u2019a is in a category virtually all his own. He has the pipes and energetic stage presence of Broadway favorite, Bette Midler.\u201d\n\nAccording to Honolulu Magazine, Kalani said, \u201cFrom a Hawaiian perspective, we don\u2019t believe in just K\u016blia I ka Nu\u2019u, striving for the highest mountain and you get to the top and that\u2019s the end. We continue to soar and continue to climb. In Hawaiian, we call it \u2018akahi a ho\u2019omaka, the beginning of every journey. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a start and finish line, like a marathon. This is just the start for me, even though I\u2019ve been singing for nearly 30 years.\u201d\n\n'Akahi a ho'omaka, this is the start.", "otherInfo": "Kalani is a singer of power, sensitivity, and charisma, one of the most promising talents in a new generation of Hawaiian musicians. He has won 2 Grammy Awards for Best Regional Roots album to date, one for each of his two CDs releases, the only Hawaiian artist to win in this category. His first CD also won him a 2017 Na Hoku Hanohano Award (Hawai\u2018i\u2019s \u201cGrammy\u201d), making Hawaiian music history as the only album to win both a Grammy and Na Hoku. This year, he hit another first - he made his debut appearance at the prestigious Merrie Monarch hula competition, singing one of his original songs for the hula group that went on to take home the top honor at the competition.\n\nKalani has been praised for Hawaiian language fluency, songwriting skills, and commitment to his Hawaiian roots, as well as a musical range runs from traditional chant to Hawaiian classics to new songs to R&B and a charming and dynamic presence on-stage. He began singing at age 4 to address a stutter as a child, and his natural talent was subsequently recognized in singing competitions from childhood to college years, and has brought him to the forefront of Hawaiian music today."}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "New American Farmers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6960045.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ivy Room Presents"}, {"Address": "453 Cortland ave, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Rock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6643774.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.416775, 37.739269], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-hop, Rap, Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lucky Horseshoe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rock and Blues Jam with Ed Ivey This classic blues & funk jam session is a popular mid-week event featuring great local blues players.

He first grabbed a guitar at age 13 and soon became proficient at mimicking what he heard on the radio. But the popular grunge rock, hip-hop and metal of the 1990s didn\u2019t move him, and he quickly grew bored. And then he heard Jimi Hendrix. \u201cHe was larger than life. What he did was mind-blowing. When I realized Hendrix was influenced by the blues, I found my path,\u201d he says. By 17, he was deep into the blues, listening to Albert King, Freddie King, Albert Collins, Muddy Waters, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins and especially Buddy Guy. As luck would have it, just as Birchwood was discovering Guy, the blues master had a concert scheduled in Orlando. Birchwood was there, front and center. \u201cI was floored,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI completely connected with the blues. I knew I had to make this music.\u201d\n\nAs Selwyn\u2019s guitar proficiency grew, a friend told him that his neighbor was a blues guitarist and had a band. The 19-year-old Selwyn went over to check it out and jam. The guitar-playing neighbor turned out to be the Texas-born blues legend Sonny Rhodes, who was instantly impressed with the enthusiastic young guitar slinger. Within one month\u2019s time, Rhodes asked Birchwood to pack his bags and join him on the road. It was an incredible experience for Birchwood, as Rhodes took the young man under his wing, teaching him not only guitar and lap steel, but also how to conduct business, how to run a band, and how to reach an audience. \u201cSonny always said, \u2018Play what\u2019s in your heart.\u2019 I\u2019ve never lost sight of that,\u201d says Birchwood.\n\nRhodes insisted Birchwood go to college and always held the guitar spot in his band open for Selwyn whenever he was available. It was a win-win situation, as Birchwood\u2014through hard work and scholarships\u2014received his MBA from The University of Tampa. \u201cI challenged myself to get that degree,\u201d Birchwood says. \u201cThese days, it\u2019s not good enough to just be a good player.\u201d Combining the musical lessons learned from Rhodes and his business acumen, Birchwood created The Selwyn Birchwood Band in 2010, featuring veteran musicians older than Selwyn, testifying to Selwyn\u2019s musical chops and his leadership skills. On stage, they play off each other with ease, feeding off each other\u2019s energy, sharing the fun with the audience.\n\nIn 2011 the self-released FL Boy helped the band land gigs outside of their Tampa base, where they were becoming local heroes. Birchwood and his band won their way to spots at the 2012 and 2013 International Blues Challenges in Memphis. After taking ninth place in 2012, they came back determined the next year, taking first place. Alligator Records president Bruce Iglauer was sitting at the judges\u2019 table at the time. \u201cI saw Selwyn\u2019s potential in 2012. He absolutely deserved to win in 2013,\u201d he says. The victory opened more doors for Birchwood, increased his exposure and helped the band land a deal with Intrepid Artists booking agency, which led to more and better gigs.\n\nWith his 2014 Alligator Records debut album, Don\u2019t Call No Ambulance, Selwyn Birchwood announced his arrival on the international blues stage. The album is a fully realized vision of contemporary blues. Between his uninhibited sense of fun and adventure and his serious-as-a-heart-attack musicianship, Don\u2019t Call No Ambulance opened a door into a bright future for the blues. Rave reviews ran in publications from Rolling Stone to The Wall Street Journal, from The Chicago Tribune to The San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe Selwyn Birchwood Band has been touring non-stop since before the Alligator debut came out. The band has performed at festivals including The Chicago Blues Festival, The Waterfront Blues Festival, The Mississippi Valley Blues Festival, The Tampa Bay Blues Festival, The North Atlantic Blues Festival, The King Biscuit Blues Festival as well as on The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise and Joe Bonamassa\u2019s Keeping The Blues Alive Cruise. Internationally, they have performed at The Great British Rhythm & Blues Festival, Jazz a Vienne in France, the Rawa Blues Festival in Poland, the Moulin Blues Festival in The Netherlands, the Ottawa Blues Festival in Canada, as well as performing in Spain, Switzerland, Norway, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Belgium and Mexico.\n\nBirchwood has opened for major blues stars including Robert Cray and Buddy Guy and has shared the stage with another friend and teacher, Joe Louis Walker. Not long ago, Selwyn had the opportunity, when performing in San Francisco, to bring his friend and mentor Sonny Rhodes on stage to sit in with his band. It was a moment Birchwood will never forget. \u201cHe did so much for me; it was a real honor to return the favor.\u201d\n\nWith Pick Your Poison\u2019s urgent, uncompromising music, Selwyn Birchwood is forging new directions for the blues. The Washington Post calls him a \u201ctough, indelibly modern next generation bluesman.\u201d The Wall Street Journal says he is \u201cfiery and original.\u201d The hard-hitting, cutting-edge songs on Pick Your Poison, along with his incendiary live performances, prove without a doubt his status as the blues\u2019 most sensational young talent.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1928 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Caress", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.80952], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Uptown Nightclub!", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Dreampop / post-punk / darkwave show with Caress (LA), Deathlist (Portland), The Acharis, and Fawning"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "The Undercurrent", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8798003.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "A San Francisco-based indie duo making music after midnight.", "otherInfo": "GEOWULF\nThe Undercurrent\n8 pm\n$15\nAll Ages"}, {"Address": "401 Grove St, Sonoma, CA 95476", "Artist": "Ashleigh Flynn - Home Perm Records", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8639106.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.485221, 38.300212], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "Genres: Americana", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Reel & Brand", "moreBioInfo": "Ashleigh's new record is KILLER!

Since that auspicious beginning, Sheila has gone on to forge her way through many aspects of the music business including singer, talent buyer, artist manager, record label partner and owner of a roadhouse tavern. Sheila has now come full circle and is back to her creative roots. She started writing songs in late 2018. \u201cIt all started after the Carr Fire in Redding, CA which burned down a third of my neighborhood. I was evacuated and a song started coming to me one night as I lay wide awake in my hotel bed at 3:00am. The song had nothing to do with the fire but for some reason the experience opened a new door in my life and now I find myself releasing an EP!\u201d Her partner in crime is Kevin Russell whose musical talent brought the songs to life and \u201cspecial thanks to Foxes In The Henhouse, Mary Gannon Graham, Blair Hardman, Spencer Burrows and Sean Allen who all showed up to ride the ride with me\u201d. Her music is a mix of americana, country, pop and folk styles. Her voice is reminiscent of Lucinda Williams and Roseanne Cash, it is honest and real. Sheila says, \u201cThe theme of \u201cBroken Compass\u201d is leaving and the fall out that comes with that; loss, regret, empowerment, determination. It\u2019s been an amazing experience exploring this creative side of myself. My hope is that my songs resonate and create a connection to my fellow humans. I would like that.\u201dKevin Russell is a multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter. He performs regularly in a number of Sonoma county\u2019s most popular bands. All of these groups perform at local club venues, county fairs, parties, festivals, weddings and special events. [see band descriptions below] In addition, he is the driving force behind The Sebastopol Guitar Festival, held in early February. In addition to being a musician Kevin hosts shows featuring touring musicians like Joe Craven, Gonzalo Bergara, Jim Hurst, Richard Smith, Jim & Morning Nichols, Radney Foster, Jack Tempchin, Ray Bierl, Mike Dowling, Laurie Lewis, Kathy Kallick, Missy Raines & others. He has appeared as a sideman on 21 local recordings by songwriters & groups, has recorded eight CD's with his various bands and has six CD's out under his name.

In October 2017, he was part of an upcoming Delmark recording called Back To Chicago by the Rockwell Avenue Blues Band. It is slated for release in March 2018. Steve's most recent solo recording, Come On In This House received a great deal of critical acclaim when released in 2014. His third studio album, Lonesome Flight was released by 9 Below Productions in 2010 and included nine original songs along with four blues classics. He also has two solo records released on the historic Delmark label, C For Chicago, and I\u2019ll Be Your Mule.

He spent two years working with Big Walter Horton and Floyd Jones, learning the deep blues and the idiosyncrasies that are part of the art. In 1978, he became Sunnyland Slim's main guitarist, playing just about every gig with the piano legend until the time of his death. Freund became the consummate piano accompanist working with Pinetop Perkins, Jimmy Walker, Henry Gray, Erwin Helfer and many more. He also spent nine years working with harmonica legend James Cotton.\nFreund's dedication and knowledge of the blues earned him the opportunity to teach accredited courses at Chicago's Columbia College in 1993-94.\nHe moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1990s. He plays regularly at The Saloon in San Francisco, Club Deluxe in San Francisco and Armando's in Martinez. He also tours nationally and internationally.

She started her first band, The Bunnies at age 7. \u201cMy favorite part of performing was being able to wear my sister\u2019s wig, it made me feel like Ginger Grant\u201d she says with a smile. Since that auspicious beginning, Sheila has gone on to forge her way through many aspects of the music business including singer, talent buyer, artist manager, record label partner and owner of a roadhouse tavern. Sheila has now come full circle and is back to her creative roots. She started writing songs in late 2018. \u201cIt all started after the Carr Fire in Redding, CA which burned down a third of my neighborhood. I was evacuated and a song started coming to me one night as I lay wide awake in my hotel bed at 3:00am. The song had nothing to do with the fire but for some reason the experience opened a new door in my life and now I find myself releasing an EP!\u201d Her partner in crime is Kevin Russell whose musical talent brought the songs to life and \u201cspecial thanks to Foxes In The Henhouse, Mary Gannon Graham, Blair Hardman, Spencer Burrows and Sean Allen who all showed up to ride the ride with me\u201d. Her music is a mix of americana, country, pop and folk styles. Her voice is reminiscent of Lucinda Williams and Roseanne Cash, it is honest and real. Sheila says, \u201cThe theme of \u201cBroken Compass\u201d is leaving and the fall out that comes with that; loss, regret, empowerment, determination. It\u2019s been an amazing experience exploring this creative side of myself. My hope is that my songs resonate and create a connection to my fellow humans. I would like that.\u201dKevin Russell is a multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter. He performs regularly in a number of Sonoma county\u2019s most popular bands. All of these groups perform at local club venues, county fairs, parties, festivals, weddings and special events. [see band descriptions below] In addition, he is the driving force behind The Sebastopol Guitar Festival, held in early February. In addition to being a musician Kevin hosts shows featuring touring musicians like Joe Craven, Gonzalo Bergara, Jim Hurst, Richard Smith, Jim & Morning Nichols, Radney Foster, Jack Tempchin, Ray Bierl, Mike Dowling, Laurie Lewis, Kathy Kallick, Missy Raines & others. He has appeared as a sideman on 21 local recordings by songwriters & groups, has recorded eight CD's with his various bands and has six CD's out under his name. He is a former DJ (KRCB) and writes CD reviews for the online website Freight Train Boogie.com. And, lastly, Kevin has performed as a side player for a number of local songwriters, including Michael Capella, Mark McLay, Teresa Tudury, Doug Jayne, Audrey Auld, Terry Pinnegar, Greg Abel, Greg Scherer, Amy McCarley & more."}, {"Address": "99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "DeVault", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8858136.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.417316, 37.778083], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "Sage DeVault, better known by his stylized surname DEVAULT, is a 23 year old American musician from the calm scenes of Orange County, California.\n\nIn late 2017, Devault reached an early breakthrough from his official remix for DJ Snake, which was later named by Billboard as one of the top 10 remixes of the year. With official redos for artists such as Rihanna, 6LACK, Alessia Cara, Daya, and Sabrina Claudio under his belt, Devault approached 2018 as a time to debut his original work with Geffen Records. Featuring the likes of Njomza, Bipolar Sunshine, & Matt Maeson, Devault's debut EP 'Stay' captured immediate attention, particularly singles 'Nothing But You' & 'Between the Words.' Alongside his new material, Devault went on to perform at major festivals such as HARD Summer, Coachella - Heineken House, Electric Zoo, and Holy Ship, to name a few. Already in 2019, Devault released a dark, haunting audiovisual EP titled 'JADE' which gathered large press attention from Playboy, Flaunt, Nude, and Nakid Magazine. \"He knows how to zero in on popular electronic emotion while letting more nuanced synth sounds hang a little\" noted Flaunt Magazine around his recent 'JADE' release. Taking inspiration from the early new wave talent of Depeche Mode and the notorious Daft Punk, Devault is bridging the gap between a nostalgic and original sound.

Songs were written collectively by the band\u2014guitarist Dylan Brock, singer/guitarist Andrew Griffin, bassist Christian Hernandez, and drummer Art McConnell. Felsen took a strictly DIY approach with this new album, recording and mixing it themselves at Hernandez\u2019s house in the East Bay.\n\nThe songs fit together like a novel telling a story about the need to re-humanize ourselves in the face of excess affluence. In the wake of soul-crushing technological advancements, art wins, humanity prevails. Felsen\u2019s influences include Wilco (Summerteeth), The Beatles (White Album), Beach Boys (Smile), U2 (Achtung Baby), Radiohead (OK Computer), Flaming Lips (Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots), Pink Floyd (Meddle), Spoon (Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga), and Camper Van Beethoven (Key Lime Pie).\n\nFelsen has toured throughout the West and are now about to embark on their largest national tour to date. Felsen has opened for Camper Van Beethoven, Marcy Playground, One Eskimo, Stone Foxes and Luce. In November, 2010, Deli Magazine readers voted them Band of the Month. They have performed at Noise Pop and three of their songs are included in Rock Band, the video game.\n\nFrontman Andrew Griffin started Felsen after his 2006 cancer diagnosis, which led to the release of Felsen's first album, Accidental Drowning, in 2009.

Recorded live off the floor in Nashville, Tennessee, celebrated songwriter Matt Andersen\u2019s tenth album collects all the essential elements for a down-home ramble and shoots them through with enough electrifying energy to drive the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll faithful to simmer, shimmy, and shake. Over its lucky 13 tracks, he explores every facet of his sound\u2014sweat-soaked soul, incendiary rhythm and blues, heartbroken folk, and gritty Americana\u2014and binds them together with palpable heart, as the band leaves everything they\u2019ve got on the sweet old hardwood of the Southern Ground studio, in the same spot that legends like Neil Young, Emmylou Harris, and Jerry Lee Lewis turned up the volume \u2018til it couldn\u2019t go up anymore.\n\nAlong with the infiltrating buzz of Music City putting its stamp on the record, the studio itself became like a second home for Matt and the band. He and bassist Mike Farrington would routinely kick back with a drink and just listen to the horn section reminisce about the players they\u2019d shared the stage with, and the kitchen took on its typical all-important role as war room, the spot where meals brought the whole crew together to plot next steps. Sometimes it\u2019s tension that shapes a record. But what Halfway Home by Morning offers is soul rejuvenation, looking outward at the anxious state of the world and offering a helping hand, or searching inward to clarify what really matters. And to make a record like that, with warmth and verve, you need to keep your comrades close and feelin\u2019 right. \u201cThere really is nothing like listening back in the studio and everybody has the same smile on their face over what we\u2019re hearing,\u201d Matt says. \u201cYou can\u2019t fake the vibe of musicians playing together, responding to the choices others are making in that moment.\u201d\n\nOf course, fake vibes were never a threat to Matt. The native New Brunswicker has proven time and time again, on stages everywhere from clubs to theatres, that he\u2019s the genuine article. And Halfway Home by Morning is as honest and compromise free as anything he\u2019s ever done. It stands apart, though, injected with that feel good swagger that comes from everyone making a racket in the same room. \u201cWhat Would Your Mama Say?\u201d opens things up on with a slithering groove, introducing us to the velvet smooth backing vocals of The McCrary Sisters. Amy Helm joins the party to slow burn the place down on \u201cSomething to Lose,\u201d a righteously tender duet that explores the long, scarred, and loving history of a relationship. \u201cGasoline\u201d blazes appropriately with horn blasts and tambourine shuffle, as Matt urges all good people of the world: \u201cLet\u2019s start living and forgiving like we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d The acoustic bounce of \u201cLong Rider\u201d belies its road dog lament, pumping ragged soul like they\u2019ve got just enough in the tank to get home. \u201cBeen My Last\u201d is a devotional for the ages, with pedal steel sweeping in to burst your heart. And things finish on a relatively sparse, but overwhelmingly poignant note: \u201cQuarter on the Ground (A Song For Uncle Joe)\u201d recalls a conversation between Matt\u2019s mother and uncle, as the latter wishes he could hear Joe\u2019s voice over the phone just one more time.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that such a commanding performer, set loose on tape, has built a record that\u2019ll make you dance uncontrollably, weep unashamedly, and fill up any dark spots in your soul with a blast of sonic light. Nearly two decades into his career, still armed with his signature room-shaking, heart-quaking voice, Matt Andersen can\u2019t fail. Halfway Home by Morning is the sound of an artist doing what he was born to do\u2014laying his soul bare using the music that can\u2019t help but run through him. And doing it with more jubilation than he ever has before.", "otherInfo": "Roots Rising! featuring Matt Andersen, Gaby Moreno & Liz Vice"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Roots Rising", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "*Roots Rising! featuring Matt Andersen, Gaby Moreno & Liz Vice"}, {"Address": "906 Broadway, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "N2N", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8747356.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412375, 37.797475], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "Genres: Funk House", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "906 World Cultural Center", "moreBioInfo": "Booking: peter@cegtalent.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "906 Broadway, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "N2N", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8747356.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412375, 37.797475], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "Genres: Funk House", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "906 World Cultural Center", "moreBioInfo": "Booking: peter@cegtalent.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "The Truth", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6175464.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Thu Nov 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-14", "Genre": "Genres: New Wave Alternative, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "The Truth return on Saturday 23rd August 2014 as support to From The Jam at the Brighton Centre - Featuring all the original 1983 line-up!

I had just graduated college, was living in my younger brother's basement in St. Louis while I was working with a Shakespeare company in town, in the midst of trying to get over the most soul crushing break up I'd ever experienced. I felt as if my life had been turned upside down. I perceived myself a burden on everyone around me, as if I wasn't moving fast enough in my career, and as if I didn't really have anything of my own. Other than my music. So I clung to that. I poured myself into these songs while working through this. I was simultaneously filled to the brim with inspiration and eager to get out of that emotional and physical basement. They are, hopefully, in-between living situations. In this time in my life, I was caught between actually living and clinging tightly to the past. This EP marks a big transition for me, both personally and artistically. We're always changing and life is inevitably a never-ending transition, but in large part, these songs pulled me out of that particular basement. Gave me a new perspective. Brought me into a new light, and, not so ironically, a new sound. Fear not - it's not all break-up tunes. It rocks and it rolls, too.

This is a blend of genres that is unique to YIP YOPS and cannot be heard anywhere else at the moment.\" The EP is a diverse collection of the bands early works and represents some fan favorites. Jaded Culture writes, \"This is the type of album that will make you either dance along, or sit quietly while you reflect and analyze your life. It\u2019s truly a delicious experience!\" YIP YOPS was founded within earshot of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Having the festival so close provided a backdrop that fueled the musical interest of the band members. Songwriter and lead vocalist, Ison Van Winkle co-founded the band with bassist Jacob Gutierrez and drummer Ross Murakami in 2013. Soon after, Mari Brossfield completed the lineup, adding keyboards and songbird vocals. Ison\u2019s low-lit and chilling lyrics puts a spotlight on today\u2019s divided culture and are complimented by the complex and colorful instrumentation. Soundscape magazine writes, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of music out there right now that sounds as original as this.\u201d The band has been produced by Multi-Platinum and Diamond Certified, Oscar and Grammy-nominated Producer Ronnie King (2pac, Mariah Carey, The Offspring, Rancid, Snoop Dogg). A top priority for the band is to offer a visually stimulating live performance that paints the story written in the music. YIP YOPS are known for their quirky on-stage fashion and antics as Ison\u2019s performance has been compared to a \u201cmad scientist.\" Comparisons have been made to Jim Morrison, Michael Hutchence and other iconic front men. In addition to being added to the Coachella 2017 lineup, they have shared the stage with Fitz and the Tantrums, Moving Units, The English Beat, Classixx, Gram Rabbit, Fishbone, and Royal Canoe to name a few.

Influenced by life's trials and turmoil, YDMC continues to blaze a unique trail through our ears and burn real images that we refuse to see in our minds. YDMC, born David Manson in Indianapolis, Indiana and raised in Jonesboro, Georgia, resides and pulls his inspiration within the city limits of San Jose, California. As one of the original members of Today's News and a sponsored skateboarder, YDMC has been recording music with the group since 2005. However, his beginning groundwork for his hip hop career began when he became a part of the San Jose State chapter of the internationally known Hip Hop Congress. After meeting chapter heads Wes, Temesgen and Warren (2003), YDMC quickly rose up the ranks of the chapter until eventually receiving the honor of leading the group as acting President. Within this time period, several of Manson's friends joined the chapter. After connecting with young San Jose producer B-A-C, YDMC with friends Legend, G.H.O.S.T, Solomon, The Precedence, G-Wiz, and new friend Madman, Today's News began recording tracks for the chapter's first mixtapes \"Expressions for Relief, Vols. 1 and 2\u201d (all proceeds went to the Red Cross for the Philippine\u2019s tsunami and Hurricane Katrina relief efforts) as individual artists. Shortly, after Today's News formed and was joined by Am-1, Labyrinth, and Mikhael (formally known as Judah) a little further down the road. Some of the struggles that have influenced YDMC in his lifelong road to power and his quest to become a great MC include having to work and hustle to pay for food, bills and studio time, surviving a brutal attack with brass knuckles in 2006 which left him near death (G.H.O.S.T. and B-A-C were also with him), failed relationships, and the unexpected passing of his younger cousin and Grandmother, which still vividly affects him because they were very influential supporters of his beginning music career [R.I.P. Andre Anthony Pittman (10/30/87 - 02/21/05) and Eleanor Miller, who passed 11/22/2008]. YDMC has been signed as a solo artist with Bay Area label RonDavoux Records since 2008, where he has released \u201cThe Out The Trunk Project\u201d (2009). He will soon drop his major debut album \" Under The Radar\" in mid 2011 featuring hit Bay Area greats DLabrie (mentor, \u201cbig brother\u201d and RDV president), The Jacka , Goldie Gold from The Federation, plus Messy Marv and Traxamillion (both made possible on behalf of Boogie Womack of Thizz Latin). YD is now working on several new projects at the same time with several up-and-coming artists as well as seasoned veterans in the local rap game. He has been entering MC battles, traveling outside of the Bay to promote, and is constantly performing (at both big and small shows), holding the title as the most consistently booked artist in the South Bay, period. YDMC is determined to bring a new style to hip hop while maintaining a close connection to its roots. With a combination of his self-proclaimed D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) mentality, intelligent, socio-political lyrics, and sharp business etiquette, he is destined to have a flourishing career and we are destined to support him. YDMC is a hyperactive, outspoken, multilayered, skateboarding MC from San Jose, CA.

While learning Hill Country Blues (RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, Mississippi Fred McDowell) firsthand in North Mississippi, he founded his blues-rock trio \u201cTURCHI,\u201d which released its debut album Road Ends in Water in 2012. Called \"everything a blues fan could want\" (LA Examiner), the album featured guest Luther Dickinson on three tracks. After a series of national tours, TURCHI released Live in Lafayette in early 2013, and exploded on the blues-rock scene, notably earning high praise from Living Blues Magazine (\"for all of their communion with the past, TURCHI sounds vital, alive, and essential\"), landing on the cover of Buscadero (Italy) and being showcased in a five-page feature in Il Blues Magazine (Italy). At that point, TURCHI\u2019s national touring grew to include Europe, highlighted with a headlining spot at Mojo Festival (Rome) in June 2014 after the release of Can\u2019t Bury Your Past, which expanded the trio with keyboards/organ (Anthony Farrell) and saxophone (Art Edmaiston). Also in 2014, stemming from his tours in Italy, Reed began collaborating with renowned Italian guitarist Adriano Viterbini, leading to Scrapyard, an intimate, intense, guitar duo album recorded in Memphis and in Rome. Called \"a marvelous example of talent and simplicity\" (Bluebird Reviews, UK), the album earned a editor\u2019s feature from iTunes (\"blues chemistry overflowing with earthy delta slide and dark pulsing electric guitar\"), and a spot on Tidal\u2019s \u201ceditor\u2019s playlist.\u201d At around the same time, seeking new inspirations and sounds, Reed moved from Western North Carolina to Memphis, where he began digging into the trademark rhythms and styles that made the music from Stax and Muscle Shoals groove so powerful. It was a time of personal and musical change, leading Reed to disband TURCHI with the release of sendoff EP We Spoke in Song, recorded at an old JC Penney in Richmond VA amidst their final performances in October 2014. As they toured in support of Scrapyard in Europe and the US, Adriano introduced Reed to Tuareg music (Tinariwen, Bombino, Terakaft). Back in Memphis, Reed wrote songs with a new sound and band in mind, and began recording at Ardent Studios in April 2015. The result, Speaking in Shadows, will be released March 4th 2016 on Devil Down Records. Revealing musical and songwriting influences ranging from Randy Newman and JJ Cale to Beck, T Rex, and Tinariwen, Reed steps out from behind the gruff fuzz into a multi-faceted sound built on finely crafted songs and ear- & rear-moving grooves. Featuring an all-star group of musicians including drummer/bassist Paul Taylor, saxophonist Art Edmaiston, Andrew Trube and Anthony Farrell (Greyhounds), and Adriano Viterbini, Speaking in Shadows is built on a foundation of Memphis groove and fat-back rhythm. Fresh textures abound, from the carnival of sounds on tongue-in-cheek \u201cDrawn and Quartered\u201d to the heartbreaking vocals of Heather Moulder on the spare, haunting lead track \u201cPass Me Over.\u201d As a songwriter, Turchi confidently mines the classic blues/rock vein in \"Offamymind\" (\"Well I can barely walk, so I guess I oughta/ Get behind this wheel and drive\u201d), effortlessly shifts gears to the satirical \"Everybody's Waiting (for the end to come),\" and turns introspective in \"Looking Up Past Midnight.\" Reuniting with engineer Adam Hill (Big Star, Dirty Streets, White Stripes), Reed strikes out for new territory with co-production by Billy Bennett (MGMT, Drive-By Truckers, Los Colognes). The album was mastered by Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes, Natural Child, The Whigs) at Bombshelter Studios in East Nashville, with artwork and design from Charles Ritchie. To implement the new album's sound live, Reed assembled The Caterwauls: Memphis drummer Andrew McNeill; Murfreesboro, TN-based slide guitarist Joey Fletcher; and Woodsbury, TN singer / piano player Heather Moulder. The Caterwauls combine soul, funk, rock, country, and gospel, creating deep grooving rhythms. Reed and The Caterwauls are preparing for a busy 2016, and the launch of Speaking in Shadows.

Couple that with all their music friends joining in on the fun, and this new CD makes a very strong case for Northern California being the new torch-bearing center of the classic Chicago and Texas blues sound.\nSix stellar originals tell the couple\u2019s individual and combined personal histories in an honest and cosmic way. Beth & RW\u2019s love of the classic blues vibe pays off and yet, these songs could easily be covered by well-known singers in many roots music idioms.\nNestled alongside are songs by their mid-20th century heroes Jimmy Reed (lead track, \u201cThere\u2019ll Be a Day\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t That Loving You Baby\u201d), Memphis Minnie (\u201cLookin\u2019 the World Over\u201d), Big Bill Broonzy (\u201cLonesome Road Blues\u201d), jump blues brother-sister act, Buddy & Ella Johnson (\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Stop It\u201d) and Memphis Slim (\u201cMother Earth.\u201d)\nRed\u2019s Blues has a finger-poppin\u2019 attitude\u2014straight outta the afore-mentioned golden years when blues, R&B and swing all meshed together and dance floors every night were filled with snake hips and slow drags. Beth, with her sensual, southern voice and classy behind-the-beat phrasing is more a Julie London or Bobbie Gentry-styled singer: smoky with languid, sexy sophistication. She can swing too, just check out the big fun on \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Ya Stop It.\u201d This rich nightclub feel is missed on too many modern singers. The yearning confidentiality, the wise heart that Beth brings to her true-life stories reveal tales of youth seen through grown up reflection.\nRW, who has not lost his hometown Rome, Georgia accent has this quality also. Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is playing another fabulous Happy Hour and a half at the world famous Armando\u2019s in Martinez.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

He also knows just about everything about throwing the perfect curveball in baseball. A master on the mound in the major leagues for years, Zito had a virtually unstoppable curve that often proved unbeatable and earned him the coveted Cy Young Award right out of the gate at age twenty-four. A studied and disciplined scholar at whatever art he\u2019s attempting to master, the world class athlete is now throwing that heat in a new direction \u2013 his music. And with the release of his debut EP, NO SECRETS, he\u2019s ready to reveal an entirely new side of himself to the world \u2013 one that might surprise people who know him only for his pitching prowess and roller coaster career.\n\n\n\nZito has actually been playing guitar since his early 20\u2019s, while on the road in the minor leagues, and he began dabbling in songwriting for fun a few years later. Born with a natural athletic ability, he\u2019s also always possessed a love and talent for music that he comes by quite naturally. Zito grew up in a household surrounded by music. His father Joe worked as a conductor/arranger for Nat King Cole and eventually an artist manager, and his mother Roberta had been one of Cole\u2019s backup singers in the Merry Young Souls. Barry recalls having a fascination with music pretty early on.\n\n\n\nAfter retiring from his baseball career in 2015, Zito immediately turned his full attention to that second love and began crafting the songs that would fill his first album. You could almost say it was fate or kismet that brought the World Series winner full circle to a Triple A team in Music City right before he retired, and for Zito, it was definitely a long, winding journey full of interesting twists and turns that landed him there and ultimately inspired the songs on NO SECRETS.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore baseball became a constant focus, Dad always had different instruments in the house, and I remember when I was five playing a valve trombone and trying to match the notes to the Michael Jackson song I was hearing, so I think I had an ear for it. I was raised in more of the Jazz and R&B worlds since my dad was a Jazz conductor and arranger. He was actually self- taught -- he didn\u2019t go to school past the eighth grade and was from the Bronx. My mom was a classically trained singer who at 19 was singing with Nat, and my dad was conducting for Nat when they met. I remember growing up listening to a lot of Gino Vanilli, I was raised on his record, and a record called Time and Tide, by an artist named Basia. These are the sounds my dad loved and that I listened to, but if I had to pick one I would say Stevie Wonder is my greatest influence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe family moved to San Diego when Zito was six so his mother could work with the metaphysical church his grandmother created, leaving his dad with plenty of time to devote to Barry\u2019s pitching endeavors. It became apparent early on to Mr. Zito that his son had a gift that could take him far. \u201cI was able to throw this uncanny curveball at seven or eight, and I was much taller than everyone else,\u201d recalls Zito. \u201dAnd my dad knew in baseball they send scouts around the world to find talent. Dad always said, \u2018if you master three pitches, they\u2019ll come and find you.\u2019 So from then on, I worked year round doing baseball.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt twenty-one Zito became a first-round pick and landed a contract with the Oakland A\u2019s, and within a year was pitching in the majors. By his third year, he boasted a sparkling 23-5 record and was given the Cy Young Award as the American League\u2019s best pitcher. A few years later in 2006 he made history by signing the richest contract ever for a pitcher at the time, with the San Francisco Giants, and subsequently launched one of the most confounding and frustrating chapters in his life\u2019s story. Rich beyond his wildest dreams, his confidence and performance wavered, and Zito began to realize he wasn\u2019t like all the other players.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the years of my career progressed I realized I was raised by musicians -- creative, sensitive, beautiful people, and there\u2019s not a lot of room in professional sports for sensitive vulnerable anything really. It was a real struggle for me to embrace my differences and be authentically who I was. It probably wasn\u2019t until the last few years of my career that I was able to do that. That\u2019s why I really love being a musician now, because it is who I feel I have always been at my core.\u201d\n\n\n\nLiving in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills with money, looks, fame, and everything else one could want, Zito not only began to lose his golden arm for a bit as his performance plummeted at times, he began to lose himself as well. Fans were brutal when he repeatedly failed to deliver consistent greatness, and at the point when he should have been happiest, he was at his lowest. There were trials and tribulations to follow, both personal and professional, and through it all Barry was led to become a Christian, and his whole life changed.\n\n\n\nThrough all of the vast changes in his life, Barry\u2019s move to Nashville, TN would prove to be one of the most influential. He not only discovered a renewed love for the game during his year with the Nashville Sounds, he also found time to focus on his songwriting. After talking about his musical aspirations in an interview with The Tennessean newspaper, an ASCAP rep contacted him and within months Barry began collaborating with some Nashville songwriters. He devoured songwriting books during his final summer in the locker room, and at the end of the season announced his retirement from baseball. Less than a year into his songwriting career, Barry threw all of his passion behind his music, heading into the studio and recording the collection of autobiographically-tinged tunes that would become his debut EP. For Zito, the project released years of pent-up emotions and feelings that had no place in baseball, but still had to be expressed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going at my music probably with more ferocity than I even did with baseball, because I\u2019ve been waiting for years to work on music full time. Every day is like a dream doing this... I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve been consistently probably since 2002, my Cy Young year.\u201d\n\n\n\nSongs on the new project like \u201cSecret To Life\u201d peel back the curtain and give listeners a unique glimpse into Zito no one has ever seen before. The profoundly personal tune illustrates his firsthand experience with how money, fame and celebrity aren\u2019t really the gateway to fulfillment. The EP\u2019s songs definitely draw on universally relatable themes, as in \u201cWrong,\u201d a tune that addresses the habit we all have of telling ourselves things that we know aren\u2019t true, but that we can\u2019t seem to be totally honest and come clean about.\n\n\n\n\u201cUndiscovered You,\u201d inspired by Zito\u2019s wife Amber, speaks to the way a woman possesses a special, hidden side she reveals only to her partner. \u201cThere\u2019s always that part of a woman that she keeps hidden, that only one person gets to see. And what an honor it is as a spouse or boyfriend to get to see that,\u201d says Zito. \u201cMy wife has her side like that, and she was a big inspiration for this song. I know this amazing, intimate side to her that nobody else gets to know and that\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe album narrates Zito\u2019s journey through life as someone who has experienced life\u2019s pinnacles and its pitfalls and come out the other side a better man. On tunes like \u201cMy Own Path\u201d he opens up fully about demons he\u2019s faced head on and conquered and the challenges in embracing your own path in the midst of adversity and despair. The anchor of this intimate collection may well be \u201cHome\u201d though, a song penned about his Christian faith that encapsulates the arduous journey he\u2019s taken and how it ultimately led him right back to faith in God and himself. Penned during a particularly tough time in his baseball career, the song perfectly captures the angst and longing we all feel just trying to find our place in the world and how, in the end, we find we already possessed everything we were seeking deep inside ourselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wrote that song two months before I got saved,\u201d recalls Zito, \u201cand I was just in a nightmarish place in my life. It\u2019s more of a story song, and it starts off with \u2018I\u2019ve been walking this road for so long, can\u2019t see where I\u2019m going, forgot where I\u2019m from\u2019. And then I make it very personal talking about how as a little boy my dad always told me to dream big and dream always -- that was a catchphrase of my father\u2019s. It talks about how I worked hard and saw the money and fame and all those good things, but then the demons of pride were there waiting too. In the end the song describes how I realized I never really left home. That\u2019s what I learned in the end - really nothing changed, I just started believing and having faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Zito, NO SECRETS is a profound statement from a writer who has stared down his own demons firsthand and come out the other side with plenty to share. He\u2019s done with the secrets, the \u2018No comments\u2019, and the quiet contemplation. It\u2019s time to let the music do the talking.", "otherInfo": "Barry Zito will be signing copies of his new book, Curveball. Books must be purchased in-store to get in the autograph line.

Asked how the songs for his forthcoming solo project came about, Demun said, \u201cI went out in my front yard and imagined what are they doing? What are they thinking? What are they going to do? What do I see?\u201d Life in Jones County, which is just north of Macon, is southern and some, including the Jones family, will say they\u2019re rednecks. They drive trucks. They fish and hunt. They like keeping things simple\u2014sort of a what-you-see is what-you-get type of place. All the same, Jones County is what you hear and Demun is hoping people who are from there will respect and love his latest collection of 12 songs, while people who aren\u2019t from around those parts will be \u201ccaptivated by it and want to listen to it.\u201d Demun \u2013 a nickname he earned at a young age because he was aggressive and energetic \u2013 was 10 years old when he was transfixed by the immergence of N.W.A. and how they represented their own hometown. He\u2019s never forgotten how that seminal album affected a southern boy down in Georgia. He\u2019s always wanted to do the same for Jones County. \u201cI\u2019ve had inspirations that cover the whole gamut of genres,\u201d Demun said. His musical influences are not all southern or country. His oldest brother Chris introduced him to Led Zeppelin along with AC-DC and Black Sabbath, while his mother Cheryl introduced him to the likes of Marvin Gaye and other Motown acts, including James Brown and Michael Jackson. A ranch owned by Otis Redding is right down the road from where Jones grew up the son of a lifelong brick mason worker. He was the third of six children, who spent their hot summer days playing football in the front yard and frog hunting in a creek behind a hayfield that surrounded their modest home. His uncles introduced him to the southern rock soundscape of The Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Back then Demun wasn\u2019t a singer, but he knew at a young age he wanted to do something musical. He started listening to hip hop and rap and was intrigued by breakdancing. That\u2019s when he heard N.W.A. That album was about Compton, for Compton and the whole world took notice. It was a musical documentary \u2013 sort of a bird\u2019s eye view of life \u2013 that Demun wanted to portray in his own autobiographical song selection for Jones County. \u201cIt gave me some hope that I could make my own music,\u201d said Demun, who wrote his first song when he was 15. \u201cIt took a long time for me to realize I could make country music without singing the whole time and still be for the country person.\u201d And that is exactly what Demun, whose vocal delivery is as intense as it is distinct, set out to accomplish with Jones County. The challenge was infusing his country inspired lyrics with hip hop grooves. Demun said the creative process often began with a drum beat or chord progression on the guitar, while \u2013 thematically speaking \u2013 each story was influenced by characters (friends, family and actual folks from the heart of Georgia) and the very experiences Demun had come across throughout his life growing up and living in Jones County, Georgia. \u201cI tried to focus on music that was for people I grew up around,\u201d he said. No song is more familiar to him on Jones County than I\u2019m a Man, which he co-wrote with the guys from I4NI and Jon Conner. It\u2019s about his father Ricky, 61, who has been laying bricks past 49 years. It\u2019s about hard work, ethics and honesty, but, more importantly, Demun said, \u201cHe\u2019s always wanted me to sing on a song and this is one of the first, you know what I\u2019m saying, and it\u2019s about him.\u201d Demun added, \u201cI had to do to it once I heard the demo and I did what I had to do to pull it off.\u201d He\u2019s already filmed a video for Tannerite \u2013 the lone fictional tale of what happens when some southern boys are playing with explosives and what occurs when they come across a Sasquatch \u2013 and Boondocks is another tune that\u2019s all-too-familiar to Jones and a legion of rednecks that Jones County speaks to. It\u2019s an actual place in Georgia, where Demun shot The Muddy Muddy video, in a 1,000-acre field in front of 5,000 people. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really understood who I was speaking to with my direction,\u201d said Demun, who went there to film a video and was so affect by the experience he wrote an entire song about it. It had rained all week leading up to the Fourth of July video shoot, but the weather was nice by show time and, of course, muddy. \u201cIt was redneck heaven,\u201d Demun proclaimed. For Demun, Jones County is a great place to live and Jones County the album finally illustrates his evolution as a person \u2013 he\u2019s married and the father of two girls, 3 and 4 \u2013 and as an artist. It\u2019s all part of the freedom of expression that comes with writing songs for a solo project. \u201cIt came natural once the process started,\u201d Demun concluded. \u201cJones County was the easiest album and the easiest songs I\u2019ve written in my life.\u201d These songs might have come naturally to him, but Demun has been playing music for a long time \u2013 including a 10-year stint as a member of Rehab \u2013 and it\u2019s taken all that time for him to get to a point where he can write songs that represent his life as it is today. He extensively toured with Rehab band mate Danny Boone and co-wrote a lot of the Rehab material, including the critically acclaimed songs for Welcome Home. He also co-wrote Welcome 2 Jawga with the Jawga Boyz, who made an appearance on Jones County as do Charlie Farley, Bubba Sparxx and Locash Cowboys. Demun\u2019s first mainstream credit as a songwriter came on title track of Colt Ford\u2019s popular Ride Through the Country, which also featured John Michael Montgomery. - See more at: http://demunjones.com/about#sthash.xSD8q3cm.dpuf BE AGGRESSIVE, B-E AGGRESSIVE", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "135 W San Carlos St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Snails", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6311197.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.903519, 37.324026], "Date": "Fri Nov 15 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-15", "Genre": "Genres: Snail Music", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "San Jose Civic Center", "moreBioInfo": "\u2018SNAILS\u2019 is a Montreal-based producer and DJ who pushes a forward-thinking brand of dance music combining hip-hop rhythms, dirty bass lines and off-kilter sound design.\n\nHis first tracks appeared online in 2012 on Canadian label Kannibalen Records.

He first grabbed a guitar at age 13 and soon became proficient at mimicking what he heard on the radio. But the popular grunge rock, hip-hop and metal of the 1990s didn\u2019t move him, and he quickly grew bored. And then he heard Jimi Hendrix. \u201cHe was larger than life. What he did was mind-blowing. When I realized Hendrix was influenced by the blues, I found my path,\u201d he says. By 17, he was deep into the blues, listening to Albert King, Freddie King, Albert Collins, Muddy Waters, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins and especially Buddy Guy. As luck would have it, just as Birchwood was discovering Guy, the blues master had a concert scheduled in Orlando. Birchwood was there, front and center. \u201cI was floored,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI completely connected with the blues. I knew I had to make this music.\u201d\n\nAs Selwyn\u2019s guitar proficiency grew, a friend told him that his neighbor was a blues guitarist and had a band. The 19-year-old Selwyn went over to check it out and jam. The guitar-playing neighbor turned out to be the Texas-born blues legend Sonny Rhodes, who was instantly impressed with the enthusiastic young guitar slinger. Within one month\u2019s time, Rhodes asked Birchwood to pack his bags and join him on the road. It was an incredible experience for Birchwood, as Rhodes took the young man under his wing, teaching him not only guitar and lap steel, but also how to conduct business, how to run a band, and how to reach an audience. \u201cSonny always said, \u2018Play what\u2019s in your heart.\u2019 I\u2019ve never lost sight of that,\u201d says Birchwood.\n\nRhodes insisted Birchwood go to college and always held the guitar spot in his band open for Selwyn whenever he was available. It was a win-win situation, as Birchwood\u2014through hard work and scholarships\u2014received his MBA from The University of Tampa. \u201cI challenged myself to get that degree,\u201d Birchwood says. \u201cThese days, it\u2019s not good enough to just be a good player.\u201d Combining the musical lessons learned from Rhodes and his business acumen, Birchwood created The Selwyn Birchwood Band in 2010, featuring veteran musicians older than Selwyn, testifying to Selwyn\u2019s musical chops and his leadership skills. On stage, they play off each other with ease, feeding off each other\u2019s energy, sharing the fun with the audience.\n\nIn 2011 the self-released FL Boy helped the band land gigs outside of their Tampa base, where they were becoming local heroes. Birchwood and his band won their way to spots at the 2012 and 2013 International Blues Challenges in Memphis. After taking ninth place in 2012, they came back determined the next year, taking first place. Alligator Records president Bruce Iglauer was sitting at the judges\u2019 table at the time. \u201cI saw Selwyn\u2019s potential in 2012. He absolutely deserved to win in 2013,\u201d he says. The victory opened more doors for Birchwood, increased his exposure and helped the band land a deal with Intrepid Artists booking agency, which led to more and better gigs.\n\nWith his 2014 Alligator Records debut album, Don\u2019t Call No Ambulance, Selwyn Birchwood announced his arrival on the international blues stage. The album is a fully realized vision of contemporary blues. Between his uninhibited sense of fun and adventure and his serious-as-a-heart-attack musicianship, Don\u2019t Call No Ambulance opened a door into a bright future for the blues. Rave reviews ran in publications from Rolling Stone to The Wall Street Journal, from The Chicago Tribune to The San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe Selwyn Birchwood Band has been touring non-stop since before the Alligator debut came out. The band has performed at festivals including The Chicago Blues Festival, The Waterfront Blues Festival, The Mississippi Valley Blues Festival, The Tampa Bay Blues Festival, The North Atlantic Blues Festival, The King Biscuit Blues Festival as well as on The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise and Joe Bonamassa\u2019s Keeping The Blues Alive Cruise. Internationally, they have performed at The Great British Rhythm & Blues Festival, Jazz a Vienne in France, the Rawa Blues Festival in Poland, the Moulin Blues Festival in The Netherlands, the Ottawa Blues Festival in Canada, as well as performing in Spain, Switzerland, Norway, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Belgium and Mexico.\n\nBirchwood has opened for major blues stars including Robert Cray and Buddy Guy and has shared the stage with another friend and teacher, Joe Louis Walker. Not long ago, Selwyn had the opportunity, when performing in San Francisco, to bring his friend and mentor Sonny Rhodes on stage to sit in with his band. It was a moment Birchwood will never forget. \u201cHe did so much for me; it was a real honor to return the favor.\u201d\n\nWith Pick Your Poison\u2019s urgent, uncompromising music, Selwyn Birchwood is forging new directions for the blues. The Washington Post calls him a \u201ctough, indelibly modern next generation bluesman.\u201d The Wall Street Journal says he is \u201cfiery and original.\u201d The hard-hitting, cutting-edge songs on Pick Your Poison, along with his incendiary live performances, prove without a doubt his status as the blues\u2019 most sensational young talent.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Carmen Lundy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7325021.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Fri Nov 15 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-15", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "SFJazz Center", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cIn a world of pretenders, Carmen Lundy is a genuine Jazz Singer\u201d\n\n- The Evening Standard\n\nCarmen Lundy began her professional career in Miami, FL as a jazz vocalist and composer when there were very few young, gifted and aspiring jazz vocalists on the horizon.

Christopher Loudon of Jazz Times writes \u201cCarmen Lundy, as beautiful inside as out, has accomplished the near impossible for a jazz singer by maintaining a solid, successful, three-decade career while focusing largely on original, self-penned material.\u201d And Don Heckman of The Los Angeles Times \u2013 \u201cCarmen Lundy shows off her own, mature songbook. Her performance was the product of talent that has ripened fully.

She was deeply inspired by her mother who was then lead singer in the gospel group, The Apostolic Singers. Ms. Lundy attended The University of Miami as an Opera major, but soon discovered that jazz was where her talent really shone. While working steadily in the Miami Jazz scene, she graduated with a degree in Studio Music and Jazz - one of the first singers to do so. Lundy then moved to New York City in the spring of '78 and immediately began working in jazz circles throughout the Tri-State area, and from Harlem to Greenwich Village, quickly impressing the notoriously critical jazz cognoscenti and audiences alike. Esteemed critic Gary Giddins stated (in 1983), \"Jazz singing stopped regenerating itself about 20 years ago, and it's not hard to see why, so it's with some trepidation that I call your attention to an authentic young jazz singer named Carmen Lundy - she's got it all.\" Armed with a devoted following and critical kudos, the uncompromising Ms. Lundy continued to make waves, not just in North America, but in Asia and throughout the UK and Europe.\n\nTeaching, too, is an important activity for Ms Lundy; she's given Master Classes in Australia, Denmark, Russia, Japan, Switzerland, New York, Washington, D.C., Northern California, Los Angeles and other cities around the world. Since its inception in 1998, Lundy has and continues to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead Program at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., as Resident Clinician and guest artist. She has also worked with the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz as guest artist and clinician.\n\nMs. Lundy is also a gifted actress active in theatre. \"Acting,\" as she told Dr. Billy Taylor in 2006, \"helps me to get more comfortable and acquainted with the art of performance.\" She performed the lead role as Billie Holiday in the Off-Off Broadway play \"They Were All Gardenias\" by Lawrence Holder, as well as the lead role in the Broadway show, Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Ladies,\" and she made her television debut as the star of the CBS Pilot-Special \"Shangri-La Plaza\" in the role of Geneva, after which she relocated to Los Angeles, where she currently resides.\n\nIn addition to her recordings, Carmen Lundy has also composed and arranged for the Sonoton Music Library, the largest independent production music library in the world.

Flexx Bronco spans a variety of styles, ranging from country to rock, blues to pop and alternative. The four members of Flexx Bronco are; Filthy, Eroc, Guy Thunderbird and Thor Bigsby. Their songs epitomize explosive, eccentric Rock and Roll decadence. Flexx Bronco takes the listener through the ages with drunken country sing alongs, heavy garage blues, with a single down- beat, jetting them off on a lightning fast full- throttle punk and roll onslaught.\n\n\n\nFlexx Bronco have played over three hundred shows in the last several years, sharing the stage with such phenomenal acts such as the Supersuckers, Agent Orange, The Bronx, Throw Rag, The Black Halos, Tesla, Sammy Hagar and Death by Stereo to name a few. The bands juxtaposition of old school work ethic and vivacious musical passion exudes in their dynamic stage shows, ensuring their fans a true rock and roll experience each time around.

After seeing Doc Watson on TV, he became a lifelong devotee of old time and bluegrass music.\n\nHe started making his living as a musician at age 19 in Chicago and in Jackson, Wyoming, eventually relocating to Boulder, Colorado in the fall of 1974. O\u2019Brien found work there as a fiddler with local bluegrass bands and as a member of the Ophelia Swing, recording with them and with Pete Wernick in 1977. In those early Colorado years, he started playing the mandolin, and studied guitar and music theory with local jazz great Dale Bruning.\n\nIn 1978, Tim co-founded the bluegrass group Hot Rize with Pete Wernick, Charles Sawtelle, and Nick Forster. Hot Rize and Western Swing alter-egos Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers eventually recorded ten albums and toured the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia. The group was named Entertainer of the Year 1990 by the International Bluegrass Music Association, and their \"Colleen Malone\" was named IBMA\u2019s Song of the Year in 1991. He won IBMA\u2019s Male Vocalist of the year in 1993, and again in 2005, when he also won song of the year for \"Look Down That Lonesome Road\".\n\nSolo recordings started with 1982\u2019s \"Hard Year Blues\", and other projects included three duet albums with his sister Mollie O\u2019Brien. Folks in Nashville started noticing Tim\u2019s songs, and he had top ten country hits in 1989 and 1990 with Kathy Mattea\u2019s versions of Hot Rize songs \"Walk The Way The Wind Blows\" and \"Untold Stories\". Other notable covers by New Grass Revival, Nickel Creek, Garth Brooks, and the Dixie Chicks followed. Hot Rize went dormant in the spring of 1990, after which O\u2019Brien performed and recorded on his own, eventually releasing fourteen solo recordings, as well as collaborations with Dirk Powell (\"Songs From The Mountain\") and with Darrell Scott (\"Real Time\"). Landmarks solo releases include a Grammy nominated set of bluegrass Dylan covers \u2013 \"Red On Blonde\", the Celtic/Appalachian fusion of \"The Crossing\", and 2005\u2019s Grammy winning \"Fiddler\u2019s Green\".\n\nTim toured and recorded with Steve Earle\u2019s Bluegrass Dukes in the early 2000\u2019s, and with Mark Knopfler in 2009 and 2010. Other recent collaborations include another CD with Darrell Scott (\"Memories and Moments\"), a track with Steve Martin (\"Daddy Played The Banjo\"), a family band set of Roger Miller songs (\"Reincarnation\"), and the reunited Hot Rize\u2019s \"When I\u2019m Free\". A collaboration with Jerry Douglas, Shawn Camp and others -\"The Earls Of Leicester\" - won a Grammy as well as IBMA\u2019s Record of the Year in 2015.\n\nTim has produced recordings for Laurie Lewis, the Yonder Mountain String Band, the Infamous Stringdusters, Old Man Luedecke, and early mentor J.D. Hutchison. He has recorded and performed with The Chieftains, Joan Baez, Dierks Bentley, Bill Frisell, and the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra. He contributed to the movie soundtrack of \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" as well as those of \"Cold Mountain\", and \"The Blob\". He is a former president of the International Bluegrass Music Association, and currently serves on the board of the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame. O\u2019Brien formed his own record label, Howdy Skies Records, in 1999, and in 2015 launched the digital download label Short Order Sessions (SOS) with his partner Jan Fabricius. SOS releases a new track every month. He has two sons, Jackson and Joel , and has lived in Nashville since 1996. Hobbies include cooking, skiing, and playing traditional Irish music.\n\nTim's latest release, 2017's \"Where the River Meets the Road, is O'Brien's 16th solo recording. Focusing on the music of his native West Virginia, it features songs by Billy Edd Wheeler, Bill Withers, Hazel Dickens, and two O'Brien originals, as well as traditional material by the Lilly Brothers, the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, and Doc Williams. Guests include Stuart Duncan, Kathy Mattea, Chris Stapleton, Bryan Sutton, and his partner in life and music, Jan Fabricius.", "otherInfo": "Tim O'Brien Band"}, {"Address": "5475 Old Redwood Hwy, Penngrove, CA 94951", "Artist": "Reed Turchi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8493079.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.667628, 38.283239], "Date": "Fri Nov 15 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-15", "Genre": "Genres: R&b/soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Twin Oaks Roadhouse", "moreBioInfo": "Raised in the Swannanoa Valley just outside of Asheville, North Carolina, Reed Turchi grew up playing piano, focusing on boogie woogie and New Orleans styles before becoming infatuated with slide guitar. While learning Hill Country Blues (RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, Mississippi Fred McDowell) firsthand in North Mississippi, he founded his blues-rock trio \u201cTURCHI,\u201d which released its debut album Road Ends in Water in 2012. Called \"everything a blues fan could want\" (LA Examiner), the album featured guest Luther Dickinson on three tracks. After a series of national tours, TURCHI released Live in Lafayette in early 2013, and exploded on the blues-rock scene, notably earning high praise from Living Blues Magazine (\"for all of their communion with the past, TURCHI sounds vital, alive, and essential\"), landing on the cover of Buscadero (Italy) and being showcased in a five-page feature in Il Blues Magazine (Italy). At that point, TURCHI\u2019s national touring grew to include Europe, highlighted with a headlining spot at Mojo Festival (Rome) in June 2014 after the release of Can\u2019t Bury Your Past, which expanded the trio with keyboards/organ (Anthony Farrell) and saxophone (Art Edmaiston). Also in 2014, stemming from his tours in Italy, Reed began collaborating with renowned Italian guitarist Adriano Viterbini, leading to Scrapyard, an intimate, intense, guitar duo album recorded in Memphis and in Rome. Called \"a marvelous example of talent and simplicity\" (Bluebird Reviews, UK), the album earned a editor\u2019s feature from iTunes (\"blues chemistry overflowing with earthy delta slide and dark pulsing electric guitar\"), and a spot on Tidal\u2019s \u201ceditor\u2019s playlist.\u201d At around the same time, seeking new inspirations and sounds, Reed moved from Western North Carolina to Memphis, where he began digging into the trademark rhythms and styles that made the music from Stax and Muscle Shoals groove so powerful. It was a time of personal and musical change, leading Reed to disband TURCHI with the release of sendoff EP We Spoke in Song, recorded at an old JC Penney in Richmond VA amidst their final performances in October 2014. As they toured in support of Scrapyard in Europe and the US, Adriano introduced Reed to Tuareg music (Tinariwen, Bombino, Terakaft). Back in Memphis, Reed wrote songs with a new sound and band in mind, and began recording at Ardent Studios in April 2015. The result, Speaking in Shadows, will be released March 4th 2016 on Devil Down Records. Revealing musical and songwriting influences ranging from Randy Newman and JJ Cale to Beck, T Rex, and Tinariwen, Reed steps out from behind the gruff fuzz into a multi-faceted sound built on finely crafted songs and ear- & rear-moving grooves. Featuring an all-star group of musicians including drummer/bassist Paul Taylor, saxophonist Art Edmaiston, Andrew Trube and Anthony Farrell (Greyhounds), and Adriano Viterbini, Speaking in Shadows is built on a foundation of Memphis groove and fat-back rhythm. Fresh textures abound, from the carnival of sounds on tongue-in-cheek \u201cDrawn and Quartered\u201d to the heartbreaking vocals of Heather Moulder on the spare, haunting lead track \u201cPass Me Over.\u201d As a songwriter, Turchi confidently mines the classic blues/rock vein in \"Offamymind\" (\"Well I can barely walk, so I guess I oughta/ Get behind this wheel and drive\u201d), effortlessly shifts gears to the satirical \"Everybody's Waiting (for the end to come),\" and turns introspective in \"Looking Up Past Midnight.\" Reuniting with engineer Adam Hill (Big Star, Dirty Streets, White Stripes), Reed strikes out for new territory with co-production by Billy Bennett (MGMT, Drive-By Truckers, Los Colognes). The album was mastered by Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes, Natural Child, The Whigs) at Bombshelter Studios in East Nashville, with artwork and design from Charles Ritchie. To implement the new album's sound live, Reed assembled The Caterwauls: Memphis drummer Andrew McNeill; Murfreesboro, TN-based slide guitarist Joey Fletcher; and Woodsbury, TN singer / piano player Heather Moulder. The Caterwauls combine soul, funk, rock, country, and gospel, creating deep grooving rhythms. Reed and The Caterwauls are preparing for a busy 2016, and the launch of Speaking in Shadows.

Vocal harmonies, guitar, electric violin, bass, drums, alto sax, and live \"looping\u201d. Born and raised in Montreal, Canada, Adrian is an exciting performer to watch. A gifted vocalist, he moves effortlessly between guitar & violin, sometimes using live looping to add layers of sound and intrigue to his songs. He's not afraid to tackle difficult topics in his songwriting; Safe Streets tells an allegory about police violence, Close Your Eyes laments the beauty bias that blankets the mass media, while Senses entreats you to appreciate your senses while you can. But Adrian doesn't take any of this stuff too seriously; his lyrics are infused with a sense of hope and a touch of whimsy.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nHaving spent the last few years performing in and around the Bay Area, four-piece outfit Mt. Meru posses a wide array of influences grounded in folk, indie, and pop. Embodying the true ethos of a DIY act with an independently released debut album in 2018, Mt. Meru are sure to keep you captivated with pop hooks whilst staying true to the simplistic nature of a once two-man act.\n\nFor fans of Death Cab for Cutie, Iron & Wine, Sufjan Stevens, Elliott Smith, Conor Oberst, The Shins, M Ward, etc."}, {"Address": "222 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Counting", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.409274, 37.785697], "Date": "Fri Nov 15 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Feinstein's at The Nikko", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tony Award winner Beth Leavel (The Prom, The Drowsy Chaperone) is thrilled to make her Feinstein\u2019s at the Nikko debut with her brand new show!

With its dynamic sense of tension and cinematic mastery of mood, TAUK\u2019s all-instrumental blend of progressive rock, hip-hop, and jazz proves to be the perfect backdrop for such explorations, giving way to an album that\u2019s both powerfully hypnotic and intensely thought-provoking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very much interested in A.I., and this idea of machines getting out of the hands of the people trying to control them,\u201d notes TAUK guitarist Matt Jalbert, whose bandmates include bassist Charlie Dolan, keyboardist Alric \u201cA.C.\u201d Carter, and drummer Isaac Teel. \u201cThis album felt like a good setting to tell that kind of story, but in a way where we could have fun with it and let the listener escape into a whole other world.\u201d\n\nEqually inspired by classic sci-fi like Blade Runner and more recent films like Ex Machina, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak embeds that narrative into TAUK\u2019s most sonically adventurous, emotionally expansive work to date. A continuation of their early-2018 EP Shapeshifter I: Construct, the new album picks up its predecessor\u2019s narrative thread with \u201cPrelude\u201d: a fantastically unsettling intro track whose frenetic keyboard work and chilling vocal samples set the tone for what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe idea is that in the EP you\u2019re seeing the construction of this being, and in the album you\u2019re seeing it break out and become something that you can\u2019t ignore anymore,\u201d Carter explains.\n\nFrom there, TAUK charge forward with the driving rhythms of \u201cRecreational Outrage\u201d (a track laced with the ominous throb of a robotic heartbeat), the futuristic soundscape and heady grooves of \u201cCMF 9000,\u201d the gauzy reverie and glorious chaos of \u201cCheckmate,\u201d and the bright melodies and soulful guitar sprawl of \u201cConvoy.\u201d One of the album\u2019s most mesmerizing moments, \u201cLet It Ride\u201d builds a brilliant tapestry from its luminous keyboard tones, kinetic guitar work, and kaleidoscopic rhythms. And on \u201cUpside Down,\u201d TAUK close out Shapeshifter II: Outbreak with a thrillingly epic burst of unfettered experimentalism.\n\nFree-flowing yet elaborately composed, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak came to life in collaboration with TAUK\u2019s longtime cohort Robert Carranza\u2014a Grammy Award-winning producer/mixer/engineer also known for his work The Mars Volta, Ozomatli, Marilyn Manson, and Taj Mahal. In a departure from their previous releases (including 2016\u2019s Sir Nebula), the band shunned the typical studio environment and holed up for weeks in a long-abandoned, century-old home that Teel describes as \u201cthe Jumanji house meets Addams Family meets Amityville Horror.\u201d Located in their homeland of Long Island, the house turned out to be the ideal spot for their makeshift studio, allowing for a creativity-enhancing seclusion. \u201cOverall the whole process was incredibly organic\u2014there were no constrictions as far as time or space, nothing ever felt forced,\u201d says Dolan. \u201cThere was a greater feeling of possibility, and it ended up being a really liberating experience for all of us.\u201d Jalbert adds: \u201cThe location definitely added to the vibe of everything we were going for. It was like we set up a laboratory in the middle of nowhere and shut off the rest of the world, which really helped get us into a specific headspace.\u201d\n\nTrue to its thematic terrain, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak endlessly blurs the boundaries between organic and electronic, with TAUK broadening their sonic palette to include a vast spectrum of synth sounds and programmed effects (such as those exquisitely eerie vocal samples heard in \u201cPrelude\u201d). And in sculpting the album\u2019s intricate arrangements, TAUK called on such esteemed musicians as The Naughty Horns, Ghost-Note\u2019s Nate Werth (a percussionist who\u2019s also played with David Crosby, Q-Tip, and Snarky Puppy), and Juan Alderete (longtime bassist for Racer X and The Mars Volta).\n\nThroughout Shapeshifter II: Outbreak, TAUK reveal the potent chemistry they discovered in childhood, when longtime friends Dolan, Jalbert, and Carter formed their first band in seventh grade. After playing together in various projects, the trio brought Teel into the fold in 2012, cementing the final lineup. Since then, TAUK have shared stages with acts like Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Widespread Panic, and Lettuce, appeared at festivals like Electric Forest and Bonnaroo, and earned acclaim from major outlets like the Washington Post (who praised TAUK for \u201ccreating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that\u2014thanks to a penchant for improv\u2014offers limitless possibilities\u201d). As Teel points out, the band\u2019s incessant touring over the years has significantly strengthened their musical connection. \u201cThe four of us as individuals are all very animated souls in our own right,\u201d he says. \u201cWe each have our ideas and our perspectives, and when it all comes together, it creates this collective statement that takes on a life of its own.\u201d\n\nIn creating Shapeshifter II: Outbreak, TAUK made that statement more deliberate and impactful than ever before. But while several upcoming videos and the vibrant artwork of illustrator Raul Urias add a new dimension to the album\u2019s concept, the band purposely maintained a certain open-endedness in its execution. \u201cPeople tell us all kinds of stories about what our songs mean to them, and it\u2019s always cool to see how wide the gamut of those stories is,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWhat the song means to me might not be the same as what it means to you, but that\u2019s one of the great things about this whole experience. There\u2019s room for everyone to develop whatever narrative they want.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "8240 Old Redwood Hwy, Cotati, CA 94931", "Artist": "Misner & Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/273476.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.705214, 38.325608], "Date": "Fri Nov 15 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-15", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Redwood Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Misner & Smith\u2019s music is a combination of soaring vocal harmonies, extremely tight instrumental arrangements, and story-filled, poetic songwriting, adding up to some of the most electrifying music on the scene today.

I think all of that comes into play on this record. It's a real comment on what's going on right now, and on trying to figure out what's reality and what's a simulation.\"\n\nSee You Later Simulator finds Behrens and longtime partner Thomas Ross Turner bouncing back from an extended hiatus to create music that ranks with their most ambitious and timely work.\n\nWith a musical sensibility that incorporates Behrens' interest in rock, country and psychedelia as well as Turner's love for avant-garde electronica and analog disco-thump, Behrens and Turner formed Ghostland Observatory in Austin, TX in 2003, setting out to create a style of music that still existed only in the pair's collective consciousness.\n\nWhile Ghostland Observatory's spectacular live performances made them a headlining attraction in clubs and festivals across America, their albums\u20142005's Delete.Delete.I.Eat.Meat..., 2006's Paparrazi Lightning, 2008's Robotique Majestique and 2010's Codename: Rondo, all released on Turner's Trashy Moped Recordings\u2014won a sizable listenership.\n\nHaving decided to create a new album, Behrens and Turner found the seed for See You Later Simulator in the material that they'd begun to cut casually during their hiatus. \"Over the years, while we were on hiatus, we had popped into the studio and worked out some tracks, and every time we did, we came up with something really good. It's like, the water's always there on tap, all you've gotta do is just open it up. So the songs were poppin' out, and they really started to flow into something bigger. The story really did start telling itself, and we started seeing the connection between the songs.\"\n\nThe reunited twosome worked together with maximum efficiency and minimum fuss. \"The set-up was very stripped-down,\" says Turner. \"I had a small console, a sampler and a piano, and Aaron had a guitar and a vocoder thing, and we just fired up the machines and did it, and kept it raw and rough. We didn't spend a lot of time noodling around, we just kind of got to it, and if something wasn't happening, we'd just move on to something that was happening. We just kept moving forward and didn't overthink it.\"\n\nThe resulting album ranks with Ghostland Observatory's most ambitious and accessible work, with such tracks as \"Paradise Lost,\" \"Permanent Vacation\" and \"Miss Abyss\" delivering both uplifting electro-dance-rock and a loose but absorbing storyline that isn't likely to interfere with the sweaty intensity of Ghostland Observatory's upcoming live shows.\n\n\"We tour with a small crew, but there are so many lasers and so much stuff that you'd think we were traveling with a couple of 18-wheelers,\" says Turner. \"On the last tour, we'd pull up to these venues who were expecting big rigs and buses, and we'd be in a couple of vans. Everyone in our crew knows exactly what their job is and that there's not much leeway for mistakes. We just come in, set up the show, soundcheck, play the show and we're out.\"\n\n\"We're really ready to get back out there,\" says Behrens, adding, \"We've already played some big shows and a couple of big festivals. It's been awhile since we've played in front of that many people, but as soon as we hit that stage, everybody was one. That feeling of connection made me happy to realize that we're back in a position to uplift people. I'm just so thankful that our band has gotten over that hump that some other bands might not have been able to get over. I'm super-happy and super-proud that we've gotten past that last challenge and that we're still here.\n\n\"We worked hard on this record, and it's just the tip of the iceberg of what's to come,\" Behrens concludes. \"This is our rebirth, the phoenix rising from the ashes, and we have no plans to slow down. We're stepping out of the weird simulation we've been in, and coming back into the world for the beginning of round two.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2209 Broadway St, Redwood City, CA 94063-1641", "Artist": "Wonder Bread 5", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8653487.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2293, 37.48637], "Date": "Fri Nov 15 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "CLUB FOX", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Club Fox welcomes popular all-around party and dance band, WONDER BREAD 5.

He also knows just about everything about throwing the perfect curveball in baseball. A master on the mound in the major leagues for years, Zito had a virtually unstoppable curve that often proved unbeatable and earned him the coveted Cy Young Award right out of the gate at age twenty-four. A studied and disciplined scholar at whatever art he\u2019s attempting to master, the world class athlete is now throwing that heat in a new direction \u2013 his music. And with the release of his debut EP, NO SECRETS, he\u2019s ready to reveal an entirely new side of himself to the world \u2013 one that might surprise people who know him only for his pitching prowess and roller coaster career.\n\n\n\nZito has actually been playing guitar since his early 20\u2019s, while on the road in the minor leagues, and he began dabbling in songwriting for fun a few years later. Born with a natural athletic ability, he\u2019s also always possessed a love and talent for music that he comes by quite naturally. Zito grew up in a household surrounded by music. His father Joe worked as a conductor/arranger for Nat King Cole and eventually an artist manager, and his mother Roberta had been one of Cole\u2019s backup singers in the Merry Young Souls. Barry recalls having a fascination with music pretty early on.\n\n\n\nAfter retiring from his baseball career in 2015, Zito immediately turned his full attention to that second love and began crafting the songs that would fill his first album. You could almost say it was fate or kismet that brought the World Series winner full circle to a Triple A team in Music City right before he retired, and for Zito, it was definitely a long, winding journey full of interesting twists and turns that landed him there and ultimately inspired the songs on NO SECRETS.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore baseball became a constant focus, Dad always had different instruments in the house, and I remember when I was five playing a valve trombone and trying to match the notes to the Michael Jackson song I was hearing, so I think I had an ear for it. I was raised in more of the Jazz and R&B worlds since my dad was a Jazz conductor and arranger. He was actually self- taught -- he didn\u2019t go to school past the eighth grade and was from the Bronx. My mom was a classically trained singer who at 19 was singing with Nat, and my dad was conducting for Nat when they met. I remember growing up listening to a lot of Gino Vanilli, I was raised on his record, and a record called Time and Tide, by an artist named Basia. These are the sounds my dad loved and that I listened to, but if I had to pick one I would say Stevie Wonder is my greatest influence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe family moved to San Diego when Zito was six so his mother could work with the metaphysical church his grandmother created, leaving his dad with plenty of time to devote to Barry\u2019s pitching endeavors. It became apparent early on to Mr. Zito that his son had a gift that could take him far. \u201cI was able to throw this uncanny curveball at seven or eight, and I was much taller than everyone else,\u201d recalls Zito. \u201dAnd my dad knew in baseball they send scouts around the world to find talent. Dad always said, \u2018if you master three pitches, they\u2019ll come and find you.\u2019 So from then on, I worked year round doing baseball.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt twenty-one Zito became a first-round pick and landed a contract with the Oakland A\u2019s, and within a year was pitching in the majors. By his third year, he boasted a sparkling 23-5 record and was given the Cy Young Award as the American League\u2019s best pitcher. A few years later in 2006 he made history by signing the richest contract ever for a pitcher at the time, with the San Francisco Giants, and subsequently launched one of the most confounding and frustrating chapters in his life\u2019s story. Rich beyond his wildest dreams, his confidence and performance wavered, and Zito began to realize he wasn\u2019t like all the other players.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the years of my career progressed I realized I was raised by musicians -- creative, sensitive, beautiful people, and there\u2019s not a lot of room in professional sports for sensitive vulnerable anything really. It was a real struggle for me to embrace my differences and be authentically who I was. It probably wasn\u2019t until the last few years of my career that I was able to do that. That\u2019s why I really love being a musician now, because it is who I feel I have always been at my core.\u201d\n\n\n\nLiving in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills with money, looks, fame, and everything else one could want, Zito not only began to lose his golden arm for a bit as his performance plummeted at times, he began to lose himself as well. Fans were brutal when he repeatedly failed to deliver consistent greatness, and at the point when he should have been happiest, he was at his lowest. There were trials and tribulations to follow, both personal and professional, and through it all Barry was led to become a Christian, and his whole life changed.\n\n\n\nThrough all of the vast changes in his life, Barry\u2019s move to Nashville, TN would prove to be one of the most influential. He not only discovered a renewed love for the game during his year with the Nashville Sounds, he also found time to focus on his songwriting. After talking about his musical aspirations in an interview with The Tennessean newspaper, an ASCAP rep contacted him and within months Barry began collaborating with some Nashville songwriters. He devoured songwriting books during his final summer in the locker room, and at the end of the season announced his retirement from baseball. Less than a year into his songwriting career, Barry threw all of his passion behind his music, heading into the studio and recording the collection of autobiographically-tinged tunes that would become his debut EP. For Zito, the project released years of pent-up emotions and feelings that had no place in baseball, but still had to be expressed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going at my music probably with more ferocity than I even did with baseball, because I\u2019ve been waiting for years to work on music full time. Every day is like a dream doing this... I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve been consistently probably since 2002, my Cy Young year.\u201d\n\n\n\nSongs on the new project like \u201cSecret To Life\u201d peel back the curtain and give listeners a unique glimpse into Zito no one has ever seen before. The profoundly personal tune illustrates his firsthand experience with how money, fame and celebrity aren\u2019t really the gateway to fulfillment. The EP\u2019s songs definitely draw on universally relatable themes, as in \u201cWrong,\u201d a tune that addresses the habit we all have of telling ourselves things that we know aren\u2019t true, but that we can\u2019t seem to be totally honest and come clean about.\n\n\n\n\u201cUndiscovered You,\u201d inspired by Zito\u2019s wife Amber, speaks to the way a woman possesses a special, hidden side she reveals only to her partner. \u201cThere\u2019s always that part of a woman that she keeps hidden, that only one person gets to see. And what an honor it is as a spouse or boyfriend to get to see that,\u201d says Zito. \u201cMy wife has her side like that, and she was a big inspiration for this song. I know this amazing, intimate side to her that nobody else gets to know and that\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe album narrates Zito\u2019s journey through life as someone who has experienced life\u2019s pinnacles and its pitfalls and come out the other side a better man. On tunes like \u201cMy Own Path\u201d he opens up fully about demons he\u2019s faced head on and conquered and the challenges in embracing your own path in the midst of adversity and despair. The anchor of this intimate collection may well be \u201cHome\u201d though, a song penned about his Christian faith that encapsulates the arduous journey he\u2019s taken and how it ultimately led him right back to faith in God and himself. Penned during a particularly tough time in his baseball career, the song perfectly captures the angst and longing we all feel just trying to find our place in the world and how, in the end, we find we already possessed everything we were seeking deep inside ourselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wrote that song two months before I got saved,\u201d recalls Zito, \u201cand I was just in a nightmarish place in my life. It\u2019s more of a story song, and it starts off with \u2018I\u2019ve been walking this road for so long, can\u2019t see where I\u2019m going, forgot where I\u2019m from\u2019. And then I make it very personal talking about how as a little boy my dad always told me to dream big and dream always -- that was a catchphrase of my father\u2019s. It talks about how I worked hard and saw the money and fame and all those good things, but then the demons of pride were there waiting too. In the end the song describes how I realized I never really left home. That\u2019s what I learned in the end - really nothing changed, I just started believing and having faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Zito, NO SECRETS is a profound statement from a writer who has stared down his own demons firsthand and come out the other side with plenty to share. He\u2019s done with the secrets, the \u2018No comments\u2019, and the quiet contemplation. It\u2019s time to let the music do the talking.", "otherInfo": "Barry Zito will be signing copies of his new book, Curveball. Books must be purchased in-store to get in the autograph line.

There were trials and tribulations to follow, both personal and professional, and through it all Barry was led to become a Christian, and his whole life changed.\n\n\n\nThrough all of the vast changes in his life, Barry\u2019s move to Nashville, TN would prove to be one of the most influential. He not only discovered a renewed love for the game during his year with the Nashville Sounds, he also found time to focus on his songwriting. After talking about his musical aspirations in an interview with The Tennessean newspaper, an ASCAP rep contacted him and within months Barry began collaborating with some Nashville songwriters. He devoured songwriting books during his final summer in the locker room, and at the end of the season announced his retirement from baseball. Less than a year into his songwriting career, Barry threw all of his passion behind his music, heading into the studio and recording the collection of autobiographically-tinged tunes that would become his debut EP. For Zito, the project released years of pent-up emotions and feelings that had no place in baseball, but still had to be expressed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going at my music probably with more ferocity than I even did with baseball, because I\u2019ve been waiting for years to work on music full time. Every day is like a dream doing this... I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve been consistently probably since 2002, my Cy Young year.\u201d\n\n\n\nSongs on the new project like \u201cSecret To Life\u201d peel back the curtain and give listeners a unique glimpse into Zito no one has ever seen before. The profoundly personal tune illustrates his firsthand experience with how money, fame and celebrity aren\u2019t really the gateway to fulfillment. The EP\u2019s songs definitely draw on universally relatable themes, as in \u201cWrong,\u201d a tune that addresses the habit we all have of telling ourselves things that we know aren\u2019t true, but that we can\u2019t seem to be totally honest and come clean about.\n\n\n\n\u201cUndiscovered You,\u201d inspired by Zito\u2019s wife Amber, speaks to the way a woman possesses a special, hidden side she reveals only to her partner. \u201cThere\u2019s always that part of a woman that she keeps hidden, that only one person gets to see. And what an honor it is as a spouse or boyfriend to get to see that,\u201d says Zito. \u201cMy wife has her side like that, and she was a big inspiration for this song. I know this amazing, intimate side to her that nobody else gets to know and that\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe album narrates Zito\u2019s journey through life as someone who has experienced life\u2019s pinnacles and its pitfalls and come out the other side a better man. On tunes like \u201cMy Own Path\u201d he opens up fully about demons he\u2019s faced head on and conquered and the challenges in embracing your own path in the midst of adversity and despair. The anchor of this intimate collection may well be \u201cHome\u201d though, a song penned about his Christian faith that encapsulates the arduous journey he\u2019s taken and how it ultimately led him right back to faith in God and himself. Penned during a particularly tough time in his baseball career, the song perfectly captures the angst and longing we all feel just trying to find our place in the world and how, in the end, we find we already possessed everything we were seeking deep inside ourselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wrote that song two months before I got saved,\u201d recalls Zito, \u201cand I was just in a nightmarish place in my life. It\u2019s more of a story song, and it starts off with \u2018I\u2019ve been walking this road for so long, can\u2019t see where I\u2019m going, forgot where I\u2019m from\u2019. And then I make it very personal talking about how as a little boy my dad always told me to dream big and dream always -- that was a catchphrase of my father\u2019s. It talks about how I worked hard and saw the money and fame and all those good things, but then the demons of pride were there waiting too. In the end the song describes how I realized I never really left home. That\u2019s what I learned in the end - really nothing changed, I just started believing and having faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Zito, NO SECRETS is a profound statement from a writer who has stared down his own demons firsthand and come out the other side with plenty to share. He\u2019s done with the secrets, the \u2018No comments\u2019, and the quiet contemplation. It\u2019s time to let the music do the talking.", "otherInfo": "Barry Zito will be signing copies of his new book, Curveball. Books must be purchased in-store to get in the autograph line.

Ultimately, Paul pursued two performance degrees from The San Francisco Conservatory. While at the Conservatory, his collaborations with world-renowned artists continue to rank as some of his most inspiring to date.\n\nIn forging a career in Greek music, Paul recently got the chance to record in Athens, Greece with highly acclaimed industry producers and studio musicians. His long list of concert appearances and performances have also led him to share the stage with some of the biggest names in Greek pop music in esteemed venues from New York's Carnegie Hall to the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile Paul continues to embrace a variety of musical styles, he has recently set his eyes on the pop music scene, with the encouragement of Grammy-winning producer Jeff Bova.

From Anchorage to Miami, the group\u2019s onstage chemistry fuels the lovefest that is a live Butter show. Rooted in the trajectory of west coast bluegrass, Hot Buttered Rum plays what has been described as California\u2019s own acoustic music.\n\nHBR\u2019s years of touring have given the band the chance to work and play with a wide cross-section of musicians, people like Peter Rowan, Phil Lesh, Chris Thile, Brett Dennen, and Robert Earl Keen. Seasoned veteran Steve Berlin (Los Lobos), acoustic guru Mike Marshall, and left-coast rocker Tim Bluhm (Mother Hips, Nicki Bluhm) have all produced studio albums for the band. Each guided HBR towards the next step in its evolution. It\u2019s a sound that is tough to describe and easy to love, and it has found its way to the most prestigious pop, folk, and bluegrass stages in the country: Telluride, Newport, Bonnaroo, Strawberry, Hardly Strictly, Kate Wolf, Horning\u2019s Hideout, String Summit, Grey Fox, Merlefest, All Good, High Sierra, Wakarusa, and many more.\n\nThe next step in Butter\u2019s evolution involves recording three 6-song EPs, each focusing on a part of music that Hot Buttered Rum loves and is inspired by, and each with a different producer. The first EP was recently recorded with Railroad Earth\u2019s Tim Carbone and will be released this fall. The second will be a collection of Ralph Stanley old school bluegrass standards, to be recorded in September with producer Sally Van Meter. The third will be Hot Buttered Rum\u2019s latenight throwdown music, to be recorded in November with SCI\u2019s Kyle Hollingsworth. Together, the three collections of songs will explore Butter\u2019s roots and express Butter\u2019s present passions.\n\nAt the center of Hot Buttered Rum is the enduring camaraderie of old friends.

Having explored most musical styles, from rock, jazz and blues to classical and reggae, Reynolds\u2019 wide-ranging musical versatility is evident each time he picks up his electric or acoustic guitar. Technically brilliant, yet emotionally honest, Reynolds\u2019 music is inspired and authentic.\n\nIt was in the mid 1980s in Charlottesville, VA, when Reynolds founded his breakthrough electric power trio, TR3 (Tim Reynolds Trio), known for their fusion of funk, rock, and jazz. He toured with TR3 during the 1980s and 1990s, using a rotating cast of musicians. It was at this time he befriended Dave Matthews and their ongoing musical collaboration began. Tim eventually decided to relocate to Santa Fe, NM, and pursue a solo career. His musical progression continued throughout his many years on the road as a solo guitar wizard, playing for packed houses and to crowds who quickly determined that Reynolds is one of the most talented and thoughtful musicians on the circuit today.\n\nAfter a number of years in New Mexico, Reynolds relocated to the Outer Banks of North Carolina in 2007. After a chance meeting with two talented musicians, bass player Mick Vaughn and drummer Dan Martier, a few rehearsals later and several stealth appearances throughout North Carolina, Reynolds decided to resurrect the electric TR3 and they\u2019ve been touring ever since.

Over four decades later, Ms. Lundy is celebrated throughout the world for her vocal artistry and is highly regarded for her jazz innovation.\n\nCurrently on the Afrasia Productions label, Carmen is releasing her 14th album in the Fall of 2014. Almost two years in the making, \u201cSoul To Soul\u201d consists of new original songs by Lundy, and a few very special collaborations. The album features legendary artists - specialists on their respective instruments - including Patrice Rushen, Geri Allen, Randy Brecker, Ada Rovatti, Warren Wolf, Bennie Maupin, harpist Carol Robbins, and Simphiwe Dana, a stunning South African vocalist and composer, among others.\n\nThe highly regarded 2012 release \u201cChanges\u201d (Afrasia Productions) is on several \u2018Top 10 Albums of 2012\u2019 lists, and continues to garner both critical and popular acclaim. Said James Nadal of All About Jazz, \u201cWith her release of Changes, veteran singer Carmen Lundy rises to that proverbial summit to enjoy the rarefied air of the chosen few.\u201d\n\nTerri Lyne Carrington\u2019s Mosaic Project - Grammy Winner for Best Jazz Vocal Album of 2011 - features the Carmen Lundy composition \u201cShow Me A Sign\u201d, with Ms. Lundy\u2019s original performance from the album \u201cSolamente\u201d reinvented on the arrangement.\n\nCarmen has had several Top Ten albums on JazzWeek (\u201cJazz and the New Songbook-Live at The Madrid\u201d, \u201cCome Home\u201d, and \u201cChanges\u201d) and a #3 spot on Billboard\u2019s Jazz Chart for 23 weeks with her debut album \u201cGood Morning Kiss\u201d. Among her other awards and recognitions, especially rewarding was Miami-Dade's County Office of the Mayor and Board of County Commissioners proclaiming January 25th \"Carmen Lundy Day\u201d, along with handing Ms. Lundy the keys to the City of Miami.\n\nHaving recorded more than thirteen albums as a leader, Carmen\u2019s far-reaching discography also includes performances and recordings with such musicians as brother and bassist Curtis Lundy, Ray Barretto, Kenny Barron, Bruce Hornsby, Mulgrew Miller, Terri Lyne Carrington, Kip Hanrahan, Courtney Pine, Roy Hargrove, Jimmy Cobb, Ron Carter, Marian McPartland, Regina Carter, Steve Turre, Geri Allen, Robert Glasper, Patrice Rushen and the late Kenny Kirkland. Ms. Lundy\u2019s 2005 release, the hugely successful \u201cJazz and The New Songbook-Live at The Madrid\u201d, features some of the jazz world\u2019s best known musicians paying tribute to Ms. Lundy.\n\nCarmen Lundy\u2019s work as a vocalist and composer has been critically acclaimed by The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Los Angeles Times, Variety, The Washington Post, Jazz Times, Jazziz, Downbeat and Vanity Fair among many others, as well as numerous foreign publications. Christopher Loudon of Jazz Times writes \u201cCarmen Lundy, as beautiful inside as out, has accomplished the near impossible for a jazz singer by maintaining a solid, successful, three-decade career while focusing largely on original, self-penned material.\u201d And Don Heckman of The Los Angeles Times \u2013 \u201cCarmen Lundy shows off her own, mature songbook. Her performance was the product of talent that has ripened fully. Lundy\u2019s far-ranging, fluidly mobile voice roved through and around the melodies, and her innate sense of theatricality illuminated every layer of drama in her story-driven songs.\u201d\n\nAs a composer, Ms. Lundy\u2019s catalogue numbers over 100 published songs, one of the few jazz vocalists in history to accomplish such a distinction, and has led to the first publication of the Carmen Lundy Songbook (2007). Her songs have been recorded by such artists as Kenny Barron (\"Quiet Times\"), Ernie Watts (\"At The End Of My Rope\"), and Straight Ahead (\"Never Gonna Let You Go\"). Officially endorsed by Neumann microphones, Carmen Lundy continues to compose and expand her vast catalogue.\n\nHer own recordings consist of 1985\u2019s \u201cGood Morning Kiss\u201d (CLR/Afrasia Productions), \u201cMoment To Moment\u201d (Arabesque/Afrasia Productions), \u201cNight And Day\u201d (CBS/SONY and re-issued by Afrasia in 2011), \u201cOld Devil Moon\u201d (JVC), \u201cSelf Portrait\u201d (JVC), \u201cSomething To Believe In\u201d and \u201cThis Is Carmen Lundy\u201d (both for Justin Time), \u201cJazz and The New Songbook \u2013 Live at The Madrid\u201d (2-disc set and DVD, Afrasia Productions), \u201cCome Home\u201d (Afrasia), \u201cSolamente\u201d and the 2012 release \u201cChanges\u201d (Afrasia Productions). Her newest recording \u201cSoul To Soul\u201d is almost 2 years in the making, and will be released in the Fall of 2014 on Afrasia Productions.\n\nA native of Miami, Florida, Carmen Lundy's path to being one of today's most talented, respected and sophisticated jazz singers began at age six, with her first piano lessons. She was deeply inspired by her mother who was then lead singer in the gospel group, The Apostolic Singers. Ms. Lundy attended The University of Miami as an Opera major, but soon discovered that jazz was where her talent really shone. While working steadily in the Miami Jazz scene, she graduated with a degree in Studio Music and Jazz - one of the first singers to do so. Lundy then moved to New York City in the spring of '78 and immediately began working in jazz circles throughout the Tri-State area, and from Harlem to Greenwich Village, quickly impressing the notoriously critical jazz cognoscenti and audiences alike. Esteemed critic Gary Giddins stated (in 1983), \"Jazz singing stopped regenerating itself about 20 years ago, and it's not hard to see why, so it's with some trepidation that I call your attention to an authentic young jazz singer named Carmen Lundy - she's got it all.\" Armed with a devoted following and critical kudos, the uncompromising Ms. Lundy continued to make waves, not just in North America, but in Asia and throughout the UK and Europe.\n\nTeaching, too, is an important activity for Ms Lundy; she's given Master Classes in Australia, Denmark, Russia, Japan, Switzerland, New York, Washington, D.C., Northern California, Los Angeles and other cities around the world. Since its inception in 1998, Lundy has and continues to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead Program at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., as Resident Clinician and guest artist. She has also worked with the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz as guest artist and clinician.\n\nMs. Lundy is also a gifted actress active in theatre. \"Acting,\" as she told Dr. Billy Taylor in 2006, \"helps me to get more comfortable and acquainted with the art of performance.\" She performed the lead role as Billie Holiday in the Off-Off Broadway play \"They Were All Gardenias\" by Lawrence Holder, as well as the lead role in the Broadway show, Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Ladies,\" and she made her television debut as the star of the CBS Pilot-Special \"Shangri-La Plaza\" in the role of Geneva, after which she relocated to Los Angeles, where she currently resides.\n\nIn addition to her recordings, Carmen Lundy has also composed and arranged for the Sonoton Music Library, the largest independent production music library in the world. Her music has been featured on such TV shows as \u201cMad Men\u201d, \u201cThe L Word\u201d, \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d, \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d, \u201cBaby Story\u201d, and many others; as well as Feature Films and Documentaries including \u201c9/11 \u2013 A Remembrance\u201d.\n\nCarmen Lundy is also a celebrated mixed media artist and painter, and her works have been exhibited in New York at The Jazz Gallery in Soho, at The Jazz Bakery in Los Angeles, and at a month-long exhibition at the Madrid Theatre in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\n\nwww.carmenlundy.com", "otherInfo": "Carmen Lundy While this engagement marks her San Francisco debut, Carmen Lundy is a bona fide jazz master who first made her mark more than three decades ago.

Hailed as \"America's best rock band\" by Greil Marcus in Time Magazine, and as \"America's best punk band ever. EVER\" by Rob Sheffield in Rolling Stone, the band put out seven searing albums in 10 years before going on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Almost a decade later, the trio--guitarists/vocalists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, and drummer Janet Weiss--has come back together for 2015's No Cities To Love. Tucker and Brownstein met in 1992 and formed Sleater-Kinney in a brick duplex in Olympia, WA in 1994. Students at Evergreen State College and members of bands Heavens To Betsy and Excuse 17, respectively, Tucker and Brownstein built Sleater-Kinney from the fire and feminism of their riot grrrl experience with a language and sound all their own. Named for a road in a neighboring town, Sleater-Kinney recorded their 22-minute, 1995 self-titled debut in a single day on a trip to Australia. With drummer Laura MacFarlane, Sleater-Kinney planted the seeds of the band's distinctive sound, defined by Tucker's urgent vocals and the remarkable interplay between her and Brownstein's guitars. With 1996's Call The Doctor, on Donna Dresch's punk label Chainsaw, Sleater-Kinney was no longer the side project it had been when it formed, and the band's songwriting and dynamic gained even more clarity. Brownstein took on more vocal duties, and the give and take of two powerful voices joined that of the guitars. Tucker and Brownstein honed their process of writing songs together, which Brownstein says is \"very specific and unique because the parts are relational to the other person.\" Along with the its pointed social messages, the album eviscerated the idea that rock godhood belonged to men alone with \"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone.\" Call The Doctor also brought Sleater-Kinney together with John Goodmanson, who would go on to produce several of the band's albums including No Cities To Love. That same year, in need of a new drummer, Tucker and Brownstein met Jr. High and Quasi's Janet Weiss through mutual friends. During their first practice with Weiss, the guitarists brought out a new song called \"Dig Me Out,\" and Weiss wrote the fierce, solid drum part that would set Sleater-Kinney's ongoing fiery chemistry in motion. \"I always considered Corin and Carrie to be musical soulmates in the tradition of the greats,\" says Weiss, whose job, she says, is to \"take their flourishing parts and melodies and push them as far as I can.\" This extraordinary formula crystalized on 1997's breakout set Dig Me Out, which brought the band to Kill Rock Stars and again had Goodmanson in the production seat. More pop-leaning than previous records but every bit as hard-hitting, Dig Me Out confidently took on both pleasure and pain with anthems like \"Turn It On\" and \"One More Hour.\" Sleater-Kinney's breakneck pace continued with The Hot Rock in 1999 and All Hands on the Bad One in 2000. The former, produced by Roger Moutenot, stepped down the band's velocity but not its intensity or complexity; the latter brought John Goodmanson back to the boards for hook-laden, lucidly feminist songs including \"#1 Must Have,\" \"Male Model\" and \"You're No Rock and Roll Fun.\" In 2001, Sleater-Kinney took a break while Tucker and husband Lance Bangs became parents to son Marshall. The events around his premature birth, as well as the September 11th terrorist attacks, in part influenced 2002's critically acclaimed One Beat. A political and anxious record, One Beat is also supercharged and strident, facing life and death from the band's singular perspective. Three years later, in need of a new setting and musical focus, the band signed with Sub Pop and enlisted Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann for 2005's The Woods. Recorded in the literal woods of upstate New York, Sleater-Kinney's final record before their hiatus took the band to significantly different musical landscapes, drawing on classic and improvisational rock as well as self-imposed discomfort and unfamiliarity. The following year, Sleater-Kinney announced an indefinite break and played a triumphant, bittersweet farewell show at Portland's Crystal Ballroom on August 12, 2006. \"It was kind of a perfect storm between the anxiety and stress of touring, and parenting,\" says Tucker of the need for the hiatus. \"Those are challenging issues, and they will continue to challenge us, but I think the time off has given us a chance to come up with some different tools for managing them.\" And with those tools, as well as a decade of broad creative experience, Sleater-Kinney has created No Cities To Love. \"We sound possessed on these songs,\" says Brownstein. \"Willing it all--the entire weight of the band and what it means to us---back into existence.\" The result is a record that grapples with love, power and redemption without restraint. \"The three of us want the same thing,\" says Weiss. \"We want the songs to be daunting.\" Sleater-Kinney's decade apart made room for family and other fruitful collaborations, as well as an understanding of what the band's rare chemistry demands. \"Creativity is about where you want your blood to flow, because in order to do something meaningful and powerful there has to be life inside of it,\" says Brownstein. \"Sleater-Kinney isn't something you can do half-assed or half-heartedly.

Derek Warfield is a distinguished name among them. Derek Warfield and They Young Wolfe Tones are bringing that musical tradition forward with a reverence for Ireland\u2019s past and the energy and optimism of a new generation of Irish musicians. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting an old tradition in a new package \u2013 and I\u2019ve the same passion for it now as I had when it all started 50 years ago!\u201d DEREK WARFIELD After spending nearly 40 years as founder/leader of the legendary Wolfe Tones (named after the 18th century Irish Revolutionary Theobald Wolfe Tone), Derek Warfield is revered as a singer, songwriter, historian and entertainer in all parts of the world where Irish roots have been put down. The Wolfe Tones enjoyed phenomenal success with 13 best-selling albums, 3 number one hits, many television appearances and shows in esteemed venues such as New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall and The Royal Albert Hall in London. Since breaking away from the Wolfe Tones in 2001, Derek\u2019s solo career has yielded 11 albums to date, the most successful of them being On the One Road, The Bonnie Blue Flag and Let Ye All be Irish Tonight. With the formation and ongoing success of The Young Wolfe Tones, the legend of Derek Warfield continues. LEGACY \u2013 THE YOUNG WOLFE TONES In 2001, after nearly 40 years performing, the legendary Wolfe Tones parted with their founder and leader \u2013 Derek Warfield. No other Irish folk group, before or since, told the story of Ireland so completely and unapologetically. But for Derek\u2019s hunger and desire to continue to further the story of Ireland through song, an ancient tradition might have lost perhaps its most iconic figure. In 2006 Derek put together a band containing some of the finest musicians and singers in Irish music \u2013 The Young Wolfe Tones. Damaris Woods - Banjo Damaris Woods from Co. Meath and is recognized as one of the foremost banjo players in Irish music. She has made a major contribution in popularizing the banjo within Irish traditional music. Damaris has performed an extremely hectic touring schedule over the last decade across the world. She has appeared on the Irish Spring Tour in Germany and been part of performing groups in North America, Australia and the prestigious Celtic Colours Festival in Cape Briton, Canada. Damaris has appearances on many radio and television shows including Ireland\u2019s The Late Late Show (RT\u00c9). Damaris is also a gifted music and many of her students have been prominent prizewinners in traditional music competitions over the last number of years. On an annual basis Damaris organizes the hugely popular traditional arts camp \u2013 The Ag Seinm Traditional Arts Camp in Co. Cavan, Ireland. Despite her own hectic schedule she still manages to find time to teach at the Joe Mooney Summer School in Drunshambo every year as well as The University of Ulster, Coleraine. Peadar Hickey \u2013 Guitar and Vocals Dublin\u2019s Peadar Hickey has been delivering the songs of Ireland\u2019s history to audiences at home and abroad for over a decade. A regular fixture on the Dublin city folk and traditional music circuit, Peadar learned his trade on stage at The Arlington Hotels, Oliver St John Gogarty\u2019s and The Temple Bar in Dublin\u2019s Cultural Quarter. In 2010, Peadar moved to New York City and now performs mainly on the Irish American circuit, teaming up with notable musicians such as Pio Ryan (banjo), Matt Mancuso (fiddle) and Vonnie Quinn (fiddle). On St Patrick\u2019s Day 2013, Peadar was invited to join All-Ireland winning accordion player Martin O\u2019Connell in a performance at the New York Mayor\u2019s residence \u2013 Gracie Mansion. Peadar is currently an instructor of guitar for traditional Irish accompaniment at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. Dan Lowery \u2013 Flute and Vocals Dan Lowery is one of the top Irish flute players in the United States today. Born in Milwaukee, raised in Dallas, and with ancestry from County Cork, Dan spent his youth travelling to Ireland learning traditional Irish music. A tour with Surreel, a band of up-and-coming American Irish musicians, prompted him to move to New York in 2002, where he has lived for the past ten years playing Irish music full-time. In demand as a flute and whistle player, and also as a guitarist, singer and teacher, he has appeared on stage and recordings with numerous musicians and bands, including Ivan Goff, Damien Connolly, Allison Barber, Johnny Cuomo, Ashley Davis, Darren Maloney, the Trinity Hall Session Players and Idle Road. Dan has been a member of Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2010. Derek Warfield\u2019s 50 years of experience coupled with the talent and energy of The Young Wolfe Tones brings the old tradition of Irish balladry into a new age. The story of Ireland is transmitted in their music and song and illuminated by the outstanding musicianship of three wonderful ambassadors of a new generation of traditional players. Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones deliver Ireland\u2019s traditional music and folk songs with an energy and skill that shows the quality of contemporaries within that tradition. The patriotic spirit of Irish music carried through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s by the Wolfe Tones now marches on in the dynamic sound of The Young Wolfe Tones. SHOWS Irish festivals all over the United States have been host to Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2007. Currently the band plays between 20 and 30 Irish festivals per year all over the country. In addition to musical performances, Derek also delivers lectures on Irish history and the history of the Irish in America. These lectures feature acoustic performances of ballads relevant to the subject matter. Perhaps most notably, the band performed at the great Milwaukee Irish Festival in 2011 - the biggest Irish festival in the world. Pat Byrne from Columbus Ohio, one of the organizing committee at the Dublin Irish Festival in Ohio, had this to say \u201cDerek has always set high standards for his performances and this band raises the bar. The people loved them and gave them an unbelievable rousing and appreciative reception. These Young Wolfe Tones and their legendary leader were given a standing ovation, The Dublin Ohio festival were delighted to have them \u2026 they\u2019re as good as it gets!\u201d Australia was the destination in April of 2011. The band played twelve concerts in two weeks with the highlight being four days performing at the National Folk Festival in Canberra. The same year saw the release of Far Away in Australia \u2013 a CD to coincide with their Australian visit. With 19 tracks the collection is a mixture of classic Irish songs music and literature that connect the two countries. Far Away In Australia fittingly highlights the Irish contributions to Australia in song and music. They perform regularly at the R\u00ed R\u00e1 Irish Pub at Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas and are certainly regarded as a unique stalwart among Las Vegas\u2019 many musical acts. AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND CIVIL WARS Many of the Irish festivals around the United States every year also play host to lectures/musical performances on the songs of the Irish in the American Revolution and Civil War by Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones. Derek deals with ballads of regret, joy, victory and defeat and clearly illustrates Ireland's hand in defending the ideals that the United States was founded on. The lecture/show has been an eye-opener for many folk and history enthusiasts from Ireland and America alike. The response and feedback throughout the festival circuit here has been wonderful and has added such a wide and important aspect to the legacy of Derek Warfield and his part in the history of Irish balladry. It is a rich legacy that was almost entirely neglected before Derek began putting together Sons of Erin, Bonnie Blue Flag, Faugh-a-Ballagh and Washington's Irish \u2014 four albums dealing with the Irish of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. He has also written a book, The Irish Songster of the American Civil War. He comments: \u201cLooking at the tremendous quality of the songwriting among the Irish over generations in the States, as recorded in libraries and collections across the country, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that Ireland lost its greatest talent in those times, particularly in those who starved or emigrated during the Famine years.\u201d \u201cI hope it helps to keep alive the memory of the many Irishmen who fought on both sides,\u201d he says. Derek Warfield\u2019s lifelong passion for engaging people in the music and story of Ireland is also very present in the other band members: \u201cCommunication with a live audience through music is what I believed to be of primary importance when I founded the Wolfe Tones in 1963. In performing with The Young Wolfe Tones, I continue to communicate with audiences while also passing on an important tradition to a new generation. But perhaps most importantly, it has been fun and enjoyable and every performance gets better. The experience has reinvigorated me and given the young players and singers the opportunity to display their skills and talents around the world\u201d www.theyoungwolfetones.com www.facebook.com/theyoungwolfetones www.irishworldradio.com DISCOGRAPHY Legacy Faugh-a-Ballagh (Clear The Way) Bonnie Blue Flag Sons Of Erin Liberte 98 Sl\u00e1n Abhaile A Nation Once Again God Save Ireland Green White & Essential Gold Volume 2 (2 CD Set) Green White & Essential Gold Volume 1 (2 CD Set) The Night Is....Young On The One Road Far Away In Australia On The One Road Let Ye All Be Irish Tonight (Available from www.theyoungwolfetones.com) Fifty years on from his debut performance, Warfield is now delighted to present the Young Wolfe Tones.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1026 Machin Ave, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "Kevin Wong Comedy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9626324.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.568819, 38.108691], "Date": "Sat Nov 16 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Trek Wine", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Dan Bern", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Sat Nov 16 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-16", "Genre": "Genres: Singer/songwriter, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ivy Room Presents"}, {"Address": "2147 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Miro Sprague", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9302646.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267555, 37.810801], "Date": "Sat Nov 16 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-16", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Improvised Music, Piano Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Sound Room", "moreBioInfo": "Pianist, Composer, Bandleader.

Leaving behind a 15-year long\ncareer of production experience in the French hip-hop scene, the Parisian producer became\nfascinated with the sounds of Chicago house and was inspired to create his own productions, infusing his hip-hop influence with the soul of house music.\n\nThen came \u2018Okay\u2019, the track that \u201cchanged the way we listened to music\u201d (Dancing Astronaut) and became the anthem of 2014. It claimed the No. 1 position on Beatport\u2019s House chart for 82 days, remained in the House Chart\u2019s Top 10 for over 180 days, was put on rotation by radio tastemakers like Pete Tong, Annie Mac and Danny Howard and received support from the likes of Claude\nVonStroke, Eats Everything, Green Velvet and nearly every major DJ under the sun. Upon its release, Rolling Stone deemed \u2018Okay\u2019 a \u201cglobal club sensation in waiting,\u201d a prophetic description that couldn\u2019t have rung more true as it remains a commanding moment in DJ sets even to this day.\n\nBut Shiba San is far from a one-hit wonder, following up \u201cOkay\u201d with the award-winning track \u201cBurn Like Fire\u201d (Best Underground Track 2015 IDMA/WMC). With releases out on labels known and loved for their irresistible tunes like Dirtybird and Suara, as well as his own imprint Basement Leak, he\u2019s since seen his career launch off far and beyond the city limits of Paris.\n\nStaying quiet on the public front, Shiba San remains a curious enigma to his international fan base, allowing the music to do the talking for him. In between releases and time spent concocting in the studio, the Miami-based producer remains a mainstay on the nightlife circuit, hitting iconic festivals including Coachella, EDC Las Vegas, Movement Detroit, The BPM Festival in Mexico, The\nWarehouse Project, Stereosonic, Spring Awakening as well as milestone venues like Output in New York, Ministry of Sound in London, Sankeys in Ibiza, Exchange in Los Angeles and The Mid in Chicago.\n\nEnding last year with two impressive Dirtybird releases \u2018Up & Down\u2019 and \u2018You Know What?\u2019, Shiba San began 2017 with a hearty compilation release on his own Basement Leak label featuring his standout tune \u2018Drop It\u2019 before embarking on a North American co-headlining tour with the esteemed MK. Later this spring, expect to hear a collaboration with Will Clarke on Dirtybird as well as a summer release on Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars.

Take a step back, and you\u2019ll see the influence of your loved ones, mentors, and friends in your decisions. Shook Twins refer to these folks in the title of their fourth album, Some Good Lives. Throughout fourteen tracks, the duo\u2014identical twin sisters Katelyn Shook [vocals, guitar] and Laurie Shook [banjo, vocals]\u2014pay homage to everyone from a late grandpa and godfather to Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cWe realized there was a theme,\u201d Katelyn reveals. \u201cEven though our minds are mostly on the women of today and wanting the monarchy to rise up, we have several men in our lives who have been such positive forces. We wanted to thank them and honor the good guys who showed us the beauty in this crazy world we live in. So, it\u2019s an album for Some Good Lives that have crossed paths with ours\u2014and to them, we are grateful.\u201d\n\nLaurie agrees, \u201cIt\u2019s also an acknowledgment of our thankfulness of the good life that we get to live.\u201d\n\nHowever, the pair derived their own strength from these relationships. Over the course of three full-length releases and a handful of EPs since 2008, acclaim would come by way of everyone from USA Today and Baeble Music to Langhorne Slim, The Lumineers, Mason Jennings, and iconic best-selling author Neil Gaiman who enthusiastically decreed, \u201cThey make music that twines through your soul the way vines cover an abandoned shack in the woods.\u201d Beyond gigs with the likes of Ryan Adams and Ani DiFranco, they captivated crowds at High Sierra Music Festival, Lightning In A Bottle, Bumbershoot, Hulaween, Summer Camp Music Festival, and Northwest String Summit, to name a few.\n\nDuring 2016, they planted the seeds for what would become Some Good Lives by thinking bigger. The girls intermittently recorded at Hallowed Halls in Portland, OR. Within this old library building, \u201cwhich feels full of stories,\u201d they tapped into palpable energy like never before, locking into a groove inside of the spacious, reverberant live room. Moreover, the full band\u2014Barra Brown [drums], Sydney Nash [bass], and Niko Slice [guitar, mandolin]\u2014expanded the sonic palette.\n\n\u201cIt took us a long time to find the band that we wanted to record these songs with and for the songs to fully mature,\u201d admits Laurie. \u201cOnce Barra, Sydney, and Niko joined us, we really started to explore what our music could be. These amazing players helped us realize that we could be more than just \u2018folk pop\u2019. We started adding other genres to the word like \u2018disco,\u2019 \u2018psychedelic,\u2019 \u2018funk,\u2019 and \u2018soul.\u2019 We really honed in on a new sound.\u201d\n\nThey initially teased that evolution with the single \u201cSafe.\u201d Its airy acoustic guitar and delicate harmonies materialize as a heartfelt and hypnotic rumination on love. The track quickly surpassed 1 million Spotify streams and stoked excitement among audiences for the eventual arrival of Some Good Lives.\n\n\u201c\u2018Safe\u2019 was written up at a cabin in the woods,\u201d recalls Katelyn. \u201cI had the line \u2018a love that feels safe\u2019 in my mind for a while. That\u2019s the only kind of love truly possible and healthy when you\u2019re touring and away from your person all the time. You feel like you can trust it, and it\u2019s not going to change within either of you\u2014no matter how long and far you are away from each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was struggling to find that kind of love at the time, and Katelyn had this other perspective,\u201d adds Laurie. \u201cIt\u2019s my breakup song my sister wrote for me,\u201d she laughs.\n\nElsewhere, opener \u201cWhat Have We Done\u201d struts forward on funky tambourine and boisterous horns before culminating on the shuddering soulful chant, \u201cMy God, what have we done?\u201d Inspired by \u201cfeeling the Bern,\u201d the track serves as a \u201cwake-up-and-do better social commentary to fire people up.\u201d Meanwhile, the dreamy \u201cFigure It Out\u201d sways from vivid verses into a catchy and confessional hook.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s about being lost and trying to figure \u2018it\u2019 out over and over again,\u201d continues Katelyn. \u201cWe\u2019re always going to be trying to figure things out, and that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nThe intimate \u201cGrandpa Piano\u201d draws on 1992 tapes of the girls\u2019 grandpa performing on a grand piano during the final weeks of his life. Such moments thematically thread together the record, following its concept.\n\nKatelyn adds, \u201cYou can hear our grandma, uncle, and godfather who have all passed on speaking in those clips too. These are little glimpses of those lives that we are honoring. I knew it was the perfect thing to add and complete the theme.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the album concludes on \u201cDog Beach\u201d\u2014a song penned by their godfather Ted as his only original composition in 1989. Preserving the raw spirit, Shook Twins tracked their background vocals over the initial tape 28 years after the initial recording. As Ted passed away recently, the song possessed a special place in their hearts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like our village anthem in a way,\u201d says Katelyn. \u201cWe made him sing it, and we\u2019d all sing the responses at every campfire we had growing up.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Shook Twins do Some Good Lives justice by reaching new heights themselves as musicians, lyricists, artists, and women.\n\n\u201cI hope people will hear this music as part of the soundtrack to their lives,\u201d Laurie leaves off. \u201cI hope it makes them feel joy, relaxation, or makes them want to dance a little.

What they endeavored to create is a defining Useless ID album: State Is Burning. For over two decades, Useless ID has been writing, recording and touring all over the globe. No college, no military service (nearly mandatory in Israel), no careers, just doing what they love. Doing what they felt incredibly lucky to be doing, never resting, never complacent, and never making the same album twice. Like most bands with this type of longevity, Useless ID has seen highs and lows, luck and the total lack of it, walking hand in hand at every turn. From basements to arenas, from tour buses to long walks with gear on their backs; from producing albums in torn up studios in Israel to making albums at The Blasting Room in America, Useless ID has experienced it all. With their first new album in four years, Useless ID wanted to share their world with the rest of the world. Four friends, four punks, who have been through it all together, coming from such an unusual place. Guitarist Ishay Berger says, \u201cState Is Burning is a love letter to punk rock. It\u2019s our \u2018fuck off\u2019 to the closed minded, racist, orthodox state of mind. It\u2019s also our statement against greedy, hateful, harmful and criminal politicians that still walk proud and in power.\u201d Guitarist Guy Carmel adds, \u201cWe wanted to start dealing more with other issues, less personal and more global. It all made sense coming from this place (Israel) that the media has so much to say about but half of the time doesn\u2019t even know or understand at all.\u201d Vocalist and bassist Yotam Ben Horin, who has spent the past couple years recording and touring his solo acoustic music, talks about his approach to State Is Burning: \u201cI reverted back to the records I grew up with and listened to them endlessly and obsessively; all the early Bad Religion records, Descendents, Propagandhi, Lagwagon, No Use For A Name, and NOFX. With more emphasis on the lyrical content, the goal was to write the best punk record we could possibly write. We took a more urgent approach this time and relied on our instincts. If it had a good energy, felt explosive or could go over well live, we kept it.\u201d State Is Burning marks Useless ID\u2019s return to fast, energetic, galloping, youthful punk rock\u2014hardcore punk rock\u2014the music they originally fell in love with and what formed the basis for starting the band in the first place. Ishay continues, \u201cOur band is more obsessed with this music than ever, collecting every album from every corner of the world, keeping in touch with the local scene and totally happy to be a part of the worldwide hardcore scene. We\u2019re ready as we ever were to go out and share our world with everyone, keeping in mind that this music is more than just music, it\u2019s our life.\u201d THIS is the official Useless ID page o.k?", "otherInfo": "GOOD RIDDANCE + Get Dead + Sharp Shock + The Last Gang - The Ritz"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109-5519", "Artist": "Chelsea Wolfe", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9163383.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Sat Nov 16 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-16", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Rock, doom, Folk Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.chelseawolfe.net/bio press updates: sargenthouse.com/chelsea-wolfe page updated mostly by management Chelsea's Instagram: http://instagram.com/cchelseawwolfe", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Blood Cultures", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9334673.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Sat Nov 16 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-16", "Genre": "Genres: Synth Pop, Electronica, Alternative, Experimental, Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "New Jersey's Blood Cultures continues to play shows in NYC around their 2017 debut album \"Happy Birthday,\" featuring top tracks 'Indian Summer' and 'Moon'.\"\n\n\"Blood Cultures make music that will stick with you long after the song ends.\" - Line of Best Fit\n\n\"A hazy, sparkly ode.\" - Pigeons & Planes\n\n\"His music is more than capable doing the talking for him.\" - DIY Mag\n\n\"Sitting somewhere between the squelchy synths of Jai Paul, and the reverb-laden vocals of Washed Out.\"- Crack In The Road\n\n\"LCD Soundsystem-esque production flair.\" - HillyDilly", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1600 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Shawn James", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9281145.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399885, 37.765168], "Date": "Sat Nov 16 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-16", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Blues, Blues Rock, Soul, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Thee Parkside", "moreBioInfo": "While growing up in Chicago\u2019s south side, Shawn James experienced the power of soul music.

And while The Last Gang may seem like a new band, their history is rife with chance encounters that led to big breaks. The band originally formed in 2007, with vocalist-guitarist Brenna Red leading the band and playing the king of \u201877 punk that allowed them to tour with the Anti-Nowhere League and Dwayne Peters Gunfight. But in 2012, shortly after drummer Robby Wantland joined, The Last Gang put their guns down and called it a day. Thankfully, that didn\u2019t last long.\nReformed by vocalist-guitarist Brenna Red and drummer Robby Wantland the pair developed the sound that would become The Last Gang, a mix of tough-as-nails punk and bouncing melodies. As they rotated through bass players, the band quickly found themselves being asked to contribute\nto the Rancid tribute compilation Hooligan\u2019s United. But due to some email based mishaps, they\u2019d be under a time crunch. \u201cWe found out we were gonna be on it the day before the deadline,\u201d says Red. \u201cLong story short, we learned and recorded the song in one day.\u201d\nBut that one song\u2014and the music video that accompanied it\u2014would be the jumpstart the band needed. Before long, they\u2019d find a permanent bassist in Sean Viele, and The Last Gang would hit the road, a handful of releases, and become a more dominant force than ever before. As the band prepped new material, another chance encounter would give the band an even shot in the\narm, as Wantland ran into producer Cameron Webb (NOFX, Mot\u00f6rhead, Alkaline Trio). Soon, Wantland would find himself in Webb\u2019s studio, playing the esteemed producer some of The Last Gang\u2019s songs. \u201cI played him the demos and he was like, \u2018Holy shit. Do you guys have a manager or anything?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t really my intent to con him into liking my band or anything, but it was a dream,\u201d says Wantland.\nWith their lineup solidified, and a producer on board, The Last Gang went into the studio with Webb to record some songs. And as The Last Gang was just about to head out on a tour of England, minutes before they were up in the air, they got a call from Erin Burkett. \u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to go to England, we\u2019re at LAX, and Erin calls us and says she wants to sign us,\u201d says Wantland. It\u2019s the kind of story that you\u2019d expect in a Hollywood movie instead of a punk band\u2019s origin story, but it\u2019s the product of years of hard work and dedication\u2014and\nthe fact that The Last Gang is a band worth getting excited about.\nWhen Sing for your Supper hits on December 8, that infectious energy will spread all the more once people drop the needle on the 7-inch. More than just a teaser for the 2018 full-length, the two songs serve as a perfect introduction to The Last Gang. The title track\u2014which will also be on their new album\u2014is the kind of palm-muted ripper that made Rancid famous, with a bouncing bass line, a huge hook, and airtight songwriting that\u2019ll get stuck in your head for years to come. And the B-side, which is exclusive to this release, is no less throttling. From the jump, the song whips up a frenzy, shifting directions on a dime but never losing sight of The Last Gang\u2019s pop-indebted ethos. After years of grinding it out, Sing for your Supper is the distillation of The Last Gang\u2019s dedication, passion, and hunger.

Known for his integration of classical, jazz, and indie-rock genres, Mr. Le Boeuf has received many of today\u2019s most prestigious honors and awards for composition and performance. While envisioning his approach to composition and improvisation as never veering far from the roots of language, Le Boeuf often employs literary elements to fuel his compositions. His recent chamber music projects include \u201cA Dream: The Musical Imagination of Franz Kafka\u201d commissioned by Chamber Music America\u2019s New Jazz Works (funded through the generosity of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation) for a composition based on Franz Kafka\u2019s short story, \u201cA Dream.\u201d The piece was premiered by Le Boeuf Brothers, a jazz quintet featuring his twin brother Pascal Le Boeuf, alongside the Myth String Quartet at the Jazz Gallery in 2012. Additionally, Mr. Le Boeuf has received grants and awards from the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts, the ASCAP Foundation, the Edward and Sally Van Lier Fund in The New York Community Trust, the Jordan Berk Memorial Prize for Composition, the North American Saxophone Alliance, and the International Songwriting Competition. The 2006 Independent Music Awards recognized Le Boeuf\u2019s album \u201cMigration\u201d as the Best Jazz Album of the year, and in 2011 he was once again awarded Best Song. As a performer, Mr. Le Boeuf has performed as part of the Grammy Award-winning Bob Mintzer Big Band, as well as with Dayna Stephens, the Alan Ferber Expanded Ensemble, Le Boeuf Brothers, and indie-pop sensation Wildcat! Wildcat! With his own band he has toured internationally and been featured at the Kennedy Center, Monterey Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall, Jazz @ Lincoln Center, Vatican City, Henry Mancini Institute, Montreal Jazz Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival, Banff Center, and Betty Carter\u2019s Jazz Ahead Residency Program. He received his training as a composer and saxophonist at the Manhattan School of Music (BM, MM) where he studied composition and performance with J. Mark Stambaugh, Dick Oatts, Nils Vigeland, and Dave Leibman. Since 2011, he has served as co-director of the Beijing Jazz Workshop at the China National Children\u2019s Center, as well as a leading teaching artist at Ithaca College, the University of Texas at Arlington, the Manhattan School of Music Summer Program, and at the Bloom School in Los Angeles. Mr. Le Boeuf is currently touring the release of his latest album, \u201cIn Praise of Shadows,\u201d under Nineteen-Eight Records, in which he continues to sculpt his compositions after the initial recording process, using modern production techniques, sampling, and layered arranging/recording methods. His next project will feature Le Boeuf Brothers in collaboration with JACK Quartet and is set to release in 2014. Over the past decade, Mr. Le Boeuf has created a sizable body of works, which can be heard on Capri Records, Nineteen-Eight Records, ESC Records, VDE Gallo, Brooklyn Jazz Underground Records and Kultur labels.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "830 Main St, Pleasanton, CA 94566", "Artist": "South 46 Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8239932.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.873787, 37.664528], "Date": "Sat Nov 16 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-16", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Country Blues, Southern Rock, Classic Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Main Street Brewery", "moreBioInfo": "Inspired by the music of the legendary Greg Allman and the extraordinarily talented Allman Brothers Band, the South 46 Band pays tribute to the unique sound of the Allman Brothers' Band with a song list that includes the ABB diverse and unique mixture of blues, jazz, rock and country.\n\nThe Band's playlist includes the classic well-knowns \"Rambling Man\", \"Midnight Rider\", to the iconic instrumentals \"Jessica\" and \"Hot 'Lanta\" as well as the mellow ballad \"Melissa\" and the more recent \"Before The Bullets Fly\", \"Woman Across The River\" \"Blue Sky\" and \"Good Clean Fun.\" Additionally, the Band plays the best of Steve Ray Vaughn, ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, just to name a few.

Analogue dissonance and traditional composition flows through hardware synthesis and guitar motifs in ways that stretch concepts of time and memory. Those familiar with his previous solo works, as well as his experiences within Nine Inch Nails, know what a treasure it is to see Cortini play live; and we are beyond delighted to present him as he transforms our Modular 6 Year Anniversary into an immersive and deeply personal journey through his own life experience and depths of emotion.RICHARD DEVINE (live)You would be hard pressed to find a name as intrinsically linked to modular production as Richard Devine. A musical composer, remixer and sound designer, whose presence and skill stretches far further than the art of performing. His sets have become renowned for writhing modular percussion, emphatic synth leads and glitchy, analogue driven melodies. September 6th will be a special occasion, as we prepare to welcome Devine for his debut headline London performance.Within the electronic music sphere, one of Devine\u2019s most impressive feats is remixing Aphex Twin\u2019s seminal Come To Daddy. Two decades on, it remains a powerful representation of his work and showcases the talented American at his best.His discography boasts collaborations with Matthew Herbert, STS9 and Mike Patton, alongside four full-length albums released on Schematic, Warp, Asphodel and Sublight Records. Painstakingly designed with incredible attention to detail, all are mouthpieces for the sound Devine represents.Devine\u2019s skill is not limited to producing, however. Composing and designing advertisements for Nike Shoe Company, while also conducting sound design for various companies including Nestle, Land Rover, and Sony, shows his career has traversed a plethora of fields and industries.It is with great pleasure that we can welcome Richard Devine on November 16th.

The Brazilian American duo say that although their new track encompasses more of an electronic, synth-based feel, the lyrical subject matter was based on organic, human emotion.\n\n\u201cShow Me (that you want me) really struck me as an intense idea for a song,\u201d says vocalist da Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s scary how detached we humans have become. Technology is great, but we\u2019ve got to remember how important human interaction is, and not just go through the motions like zombies.

Over four decades later, Ms. Lundy is celebrated throughout the world for her vocal artistry and is highly regarded for her jazz innovation.\n\nCurrently on the Afrasia Productions label, Carmen is releasing her 14th album in the Fall of 2014. Almost two years in the making, \u201cSoul To Soul\u201d consists of new original songs by Lundy, and a few very special collaborations. The album features legendary artists - specialists on their respective instruments - including Patrice Rushen, Geri Allen, Randy Brecker, Ada Rovatti, Warren Wolf, Bennie Maupin, harpist Carol Robbins, and Simphiwe Dana, a stunning South African vocalist and composer, among others.\n\nThe highly regarded 2012 release \u201cChanges\u201d (Afrasia Productions) is on several \u2018Top 10 Albums of 2012\u2019 lists, and continues to garner both critical and popular acclaim. Said James Nadal of All About Jazz, \u201cWith her release of Changes, veteran singer Carmen Lundy rises to that proverbial summit to enjoy the rarefied air of the chosen few.\u201d\n\nTerri Lyne Carrington\u2019s Mosaic Project - Grammy Winner for Best Jazz Vocal Album of 2011 - features the Carmen Lundy composition \u201cShow Me A Sign\u201d, with Ms. Lundy\u2019s original performance from the album \u201cSolamente\u201d reinvented on the arrangement.\n\nCarmen has had several Top Ten albums on JazzWeek (\u201cJazz and the New Songbook-Live at The Madrid\u201d, \u201cCome Home\u201d, and \u201cChanges\u201d) and a #3 spot on Billboard\u2019s Jazz Chart for 23 weeks with her debut album \u201cGood Morning Kiss\u201d. Among her other awards and recognitions, especially rewarding was Miami-Dade's County Office of the Mayor and Board of County Commissioners proclaiming January 25th \"Carmen Lundy Day\u201d, along with handing Ms. Lundy the keys to the City of Miami.\n\nHaving recorded more than thirteen albums as a leader, Carmen\u2019s far-reaching discography also includes performances and recordings with such musicians as brother and bassist Curtis Lundy, Ray Barretto, Kenny Barron, Bruce Hornsby, Mulgrew Miller, Terri Lyne Carrington, Kip Hanrahan, Courtney Pine, Roy Hargrove, Jimmy Cobb, Ron Carter, Marian McPartland, Regina Carter, Steve Turre, Geri Allen, Robert Glasper, Patrice Rushen and the late Kenny Kirkland. Ms. Lundy\u2019s 2005 release, the hugely successful \u201cJazz and The New Songbook-Live at The Madrid\u201d, features some of the jazz world\u2019s best known musicians paying tribute to Ms. Lundy.\n\nCarmen Lundy\u2019s work as a vocalist and composer has been critically acclaimed by The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Los Angeles Times, Variety, The Washington Post, Jazz Times, Jazziz, Downbeat and Vanity Fair among many others, as well as numerous foreign publications. Christopher Loudon of Jazz Times writes \u201cCarmen Lundy, as beautiful inside as out, has accomplished the near impossible for a jazz singer by maintaining a solid, successful, three-decade career while focusing largely on original, self-penned material.\u201d And Don Heckman of The Los Angeles Times \u2013 \u201cCarmen Lundy shows off her own, mature songbook. Her performance was the product of talent that has ripened fully. Lundy\u2019s far-ranging, fluidly mobile voice roved through and around the melodies, and her innate sense of theatricality illuminated every layer of drama in her story-driven songs.\u201d\n\nAs a composer, Ms. Lundy\u2019s catalogue numbers over 100 published songs, one of the few jazz vocalists in history to accomplish such a distinction, and has led to the first publication of the Carmen Lundy Songbook (2007). Her songs have been recorded by such artists as Kenny Barron (\"Quiet Times\"), Ernie Watts (\"At The End Of My Rope\"), and Straight Ahead (\"Never Gonna Let You Go\"). Officially endorsed by Neumann microphones, Carmen Lundy continues to compose and expand her vast catalogue.\n\nHer own recordings consist of 1985\u2019s \u201cGood Morning Kiss\u201d (CLR/Afrasia Productions), \u201cMoment To Moment\u201d (Arabesque/Afrasia Productions), \u201cNight And Day\u201d (CBS/SONY and re-issued by Afrasia in 2011), \u201cOld Devil Moon\u201d (JVC), \u201cSelf Portrait\u201d (JVC), \u201cSomething To Believe In\u201d and \u201cThis Is Carmen Lundy\u201d (both for Justin Time), \u201cJazz and The New Songbook \u2013 Live at The Madrid\u201d (2-disc set and DVD, Afrasia Productions), \u201cCome Home\u201d (Afrasia), \u201cSolamente\u201d and the 2012 release \u201cChanges\u201d (Afrasia Productions). Her newest recording \u201cSoul To Soul\u201d is almost 2 years in the making, and will be released in the Fall of 2014 on Afrasia Productions.\n\nA native of Miami, Florida, Carmen Lundy's path to being one of today's most talented, respected and sophisticated jazz singers began at age six, with her first piano lessons. She was deeply inspired by her mother who was then lead singer in the gospel group, The Apostolic Singers. Ms. Lundy attended The University of Miami as an Opera major, but soon discovered that jazz was where her talent really shone. While working steadily in the Miami Jazz scene, she graduated with a degree in Studio Music and Jazz - one of the first singers to do so. Lundy then moved to New York City in the spring of '78 and immediately began working in jazz circles throughout the Tri-State area, and from Harlem to Greenwich Village, quickly impressing the notoriously critical jazz cognoscenti and audiences alike. Esteemed critic Gary Giddins stated (in 1983), \"Jazz singing stopped regenerating itself about 20 years ago, and it's not hard to see why, so it's with some trepidation that I call your attention to an authentic young jazz singer named Carmen Lundy - she's got it all.\" Armed with a devoted following and critical kudos, the uncompromising Ms. Lundy continued to make waves, not just in North America, but in Asia and throughout the UK and Europe.\n\nTeaching, too, is an important activity for Ms Lundy; she's given Master Classes in Australia, Denmark, Russia, Japan, Switzerland, New York, Washington, D.C., Northern California, Los Angeles and other cities around the world. Since its inception in 1998, Lundy has and continues to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead Program at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., as Resident Clinician and guest artist. She has also worked with the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz as guest artist and clinician.\n\nMs. Lundy is also a gifted actress active in theatre. \"Acting,\" as she told Dr. Billy Taylor in 2006, \"helps me to get more comfortable and acquainted with the art of performance.\" She performed the lead role as Billie Holiday in the Off-Off Broadway play \"They Were All Gardenias\" by Lawrence Holder, as well as the lead role in the Broadway show, Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Ladies,\" and she made her television debut as the star of the CBS Pilot-Special \"Shangri-La Plaza\" in the role of Geneva, after which she relocated to Los Angeles, where she currently resides.\n\nIn addition to her recordings, Carmen Lundy has also composed and arranged for the Sonoton Music Library, the largest independent production music library in the world. Her music has been featured on such TV shows as \u201cMad Men\u201d, \u201cThe L Word\u201d, \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d, \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d, \u201cBaby Story\u201d, and many others; as well as Feature Films and Documentaries including \u201c9/11 \u2013 A Remembrance\u201d.\n\nCarmen Lundy is also a celebrated mixed media artist and painter, and her works have been exhibited in New York at The Jazz Gallery in Soho, at The Jazz Bakery in Los Angeles, and at a month-long exhibition at the Madrid Theatre in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\n\nwww.carmenlundy.com", "otherInfo": "Carmen Lundy While this engagement marks her San Francisco debut, Carmen Lundy is a bona fide jazz master who first made her mark more than three decades ago.

While learning Hill Country Blues (RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, Mississippi Fred McDowell) firsthand in North Mississippi, he founded his blues-rock trio \u201cTURCHI,\u201d which released its debut album Road Ends in Water in 2012. Called \"everything a blues fan could want\" (LA Examiner), the album featured guest Luther Dickinson on three tracks. After a series of national tours, TURCHI released Live in Lafayette in early 2013, and exploded on the blues-rock scene, notably earning high praise from Living Blues Magazine (\"for all of their communion with the past, TURCHI sounds vital, alive, and essential\"), landing on the cover of Buscadero (Italy) and being showcased in a five-page feature in Il Blues Magazine (Italy). At that point, TURCHI\u2019s national touring grew to include Europe, highlighted with a headlining spot at Mojo Festival (Rome) in June 2014 after the release of Can\u2019t Bury Your Past, which expanded the trio with keyboards/organ (Anthony Farrell) and saxophone (Art Edmaiston). Also in 2014, stemming from his tours in Italy, Reed began collaborating with renowned Italian guitarist Adriano Viterbini, leading to Scrapyard, an intimate, intense, guitar duo album recorded in Memphis and in Rome. Called \"a marvelous example of talent and simplicity\" (Bluebird Reviews, UK), the album earned a editor\u2019s feature from iTunes (\"blues chemistry overflowing with earthy delta slide and dark pulsing electric guitar\"), and a spot on Tidal\u2019s \u201ceditor\u2019s playlist.\u201d At around the same time, seeking new inspirations and sounds, Reed moved from Western North Carolina to Memphis, where he began digging into the trademark rhythms and styles that made the music from Stax and Muscle Shoals groove so powerful. It was a time of personal and musical change, leading Reed to disband TURCHI with the release of sendoff EP We Spoke in Song, recorded at an old JC Penney in Richmond VA amidst their final performances in October 2014. As they toured in support of Scrapyard in Europe and the US, Adriano introduced Reed to Tuareg music (Tinariwen, Bombino, Terakaft). Back in Memphis, Reed wrote songs with a new sound and band in mind, and began recording at Ardent Studios in April 2015. The result, Speaking in Shadows, will be released March 4th 2016 on Devil Down Records. Revealing musical and songwriting influences ranging from Randy Newman and JJ Cale to Beck, T Rex, and Tinariwen, Reed steps out from behind the gruff fuzz into a multi-faceted sound built on finely crafted songs and ear- & rear-moving grooves. Featuring an all-star group of musicians including drummer/bassist Paul Taylor, saxophonist Art Edmaiston, Andrew Trube and Anthony Farrell (Greyhounds), and Adriano Viterbini, Speaking in Shadows is built on a foundation of Memphis groove and fat-back rhythm. Fresh textures abound, from the carnival of sounds on tongue-in-cheek \u201cDrawn and Quartered\u201d to the heartbreaking vocals of Heather Moulder on the spare, haunting lead track \u201cPass Me Over.\u201d As a songwriter, Turchi confidently mines the classic blues/rock vein in \"Offamymind\" (\"Well I can barely walk, so I guess I oughta/ Get behind this wheel and drive\u201d), effortlessly shifts gears to the satirical \"Everybody's Waiting (for the end to come),\" and turns introspective in \"Looking Up Past Midnight.\" Reuniting with engineer Adam Hill (Big Star, Dirty Streets, White Stripes), Reed strikes out for new territory with co-production by Billy Bennett (MGMT, Drive-By Truckers, Los Colognes). The album was mastered by Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes, Natural Child, The Whigs) at Bombshelter Studios in East Nashville, with artwork and design from Charles Ritchie. To implement the new album's sound live, Reed assembled The Caterwauls: Memphis drummer Andrew McNeill; Murfreesboro, TN-based slide guitarist Joey Fletcher; and Woodsbury, TN singer / piano player Heather Moulder. The Caterwauls combine soul, funk, rock, country, and gospel, creating deep grooving rhythms. Reed and The Caterwauls are preparing for a busy 2016, and the launch of Speaking in Shadows.

Moreover, the full band\u2014Barra Brown [drums], Sydney Nash [bass], and Niko Slice [guitar, mandolin]\u2014expanded the sonic palette.\n\n\u201cIt took us a long time to find the band that we wanted to record these songs with and for the songs to fully mature,\u201d admits Laurie. \u201cOnce Barra, Sydney, and Niko joined us, we really started to explore what our music could be. These amazing players helped us realize that we could be more than just \u2018folk pop\u2019. We started adding other genres to the word like \u2018disco,\u2019 \u2018psychedelic,\u2019 \u2018funk,\u2019 and \u2018soul.\u2019 We really honed in on a new sound.\u201d\n\nThey initially teased that evolution with the single \u201cSafe.\u201d Its airy acoustic guitar and delicate harmonies materialize as a heartfelt and hypnotic rumination on love. The track quickly surpassed 1 million Spotify streams and stoked excitement among audiences for the eventual arrival of Some Good Lives.\n\n\u201c\u2018Safe\u2019 was written up at a cabin in the woods,\u201d recalls Katelyn. \u201cI had the line \u2018a love that feels safe\u2019 in my mind for a while. That\u2019s the only kind of love truly possible and healthy when you\u2019re touring and away from your person all the time. You feel like you can trust it, and it\u2019s not going to change within either of you\u2014no matter how long and far you are away from each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was struggling to find that kind of love at the time, and Katelyn had this other perspective,\u201d adds Laurie. \u201cIt\u2019s my breakup song my sister wrote for me,\u201d she laughs.\n\nElsewhere, opener \u201cWhat Have We Done\u201d struts forward on funky tambourine and boisterous horns before culminating on the shuddering soulful chant, \u201cMy God, what have we done?\u201d Inspired by \u201cfeeling the Bern,\u201d the track serves as a \u201cwake-up-and-do better social commentary to fire people up.\u201d Meanwhile, the dreamy \u201cFigure It Out\u201d sways from vivid verses into a catchy and confessional hook.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s about being lost and trying to figure \u2018it\u2019 out over and over again,\u201d continues Katelyn. \u201cWe\u2019re always going to be trying to figure things out, and that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nThe intimate \u201cGrandpa Piano\u201d draws on 1992 tapes of the girls\u2019 grandpa performing on a grand piano during the final weeks of his life. Such moments thematically thread together the record, following its concept.\n\nKatelyn adds, \u201cYou can hear our grandma, uncle, and godfather who have all passed on speaking in those clips too. These are little glimpses of those lives that we are honoring. I knew it was the perfect thing to add and complete the theme.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the album concludes on \u201cDog Beach\u201d\u2014a song penned by their godfather Ted as his only original composition in 1989. Preserving the raw spirit, Shook Twins tracked their background vocals over the initial tape 28 years after the initial recording. As Ted passed away recently, the song possessed a special place in their hearts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like our village anthem in a way,\u201d says Katelyn. \u201cWe made him sing it, and we\u2019d all sing the responses at every campfire we had growing up.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Shook Twins do Some Good Lives justice by reaching new heights themselves as musicians, lyricists, artists, and women.\n\n\u201cI hope people will hear this music as part of the soundtrack to their lives,\u201d Laurie leaves off. \u201cI hope it makes them feel joy, relaxation, or makes them want to dance a little. I hope they\u2019re satisfied with the way we captured these songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want them to feel the love that emanates from the songs: the love of the sounds we made and the love of the people we are honoring through them,\u201d concludes Katelyn.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero West, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Goapele", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8337628.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Sun Nov 17 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-17", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, Soul", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Goapele"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "John Craigie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9256972.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sun Nov 17 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-17", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Americana, Blues", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse", "moreBioInfo": "Renowned for his eloquent Americana style, engaging live shows, and off-the-cuff clever observations, John Craigie carries on the legacy of classic singer-songwriters, while blazing a trail of his own.\n\nRecently, that trail twisted and turned into new territory for the Portland, OR performer who The Stranger appropriately dubbed, \u201cthe lovechild of John Prine and Mitch Hedberg.\u201d His music speaks loud to both audiences and fellow artists.

This is the story of MUSICA NUDA, the unconventional duo born from the accidental meeting of Petra Magoni and Ferruccio Spinetti.\n\nIn 2003 the pair cross paths for the first time: Petra sings and Ferruccio plays double bass in Aviontravel (he played with them from 1990 to 2006). In that period Petra Magoni plans a mini tour in some of her Tuscany small clubs, with a frien playing guitar for her. But the day of their first concert together, he gets sick. Petra, instead of cancelling the date, asks Ferruccio if he feels like covering for him and he promptly accepts.\n\nThe concert is such a success that in the span of few weeks the two members of this \u201cVoice\u2019n\u2019bass\u201d combo put up a full repertoire, made of the songs they love the most, and in half a day they record their first album: \u201cMUSICA NUDA\u201d, in a studio close to Pisa.\n\nMUSICA NUDA spontaneously becomes the name of their project and of the band itself.\n\nThe chemical between them is perfectly clear, but neither Petra and Ferruccio themselves would have ever imagined to reach so important goals in such a little time: hundreds of concerts in Italy and abroad, prestigious awards (Targa Tenco 2006, best tour for Mei in Faenza, Les quatre cl\u00e9s de T\u00e9l\u00e9rama in France), recognition from fans and medias, tv appearances and radio plays on all main italian and foreign FM stations. It all comes from constant work and commitment from Petra, Ferruccio and all those who believed in this project over the years, but mostly thanks to an original, both cultured and popular, simple yet articulated behind the project MUSICA NUDA.\n\nA bit of jazz, a bit of songwriting, some elements of rock, some punk and the occasional classic vibe. When \u201cmusic\u201d is \u201cnaked\u201d there are no boundaries, the peculiar sound of Petra and Ferruccio flows into every single track and brings them all back to a new life, proving that they are a really eclectic combo.\nMUSICA NUDA is a brave project, independent, free, almost a modern version of canto con accompagnamento di basso continuo, in uso nel Rinascimento, and it\u2019s also the art of trace music back to its core and find in its inside the ultimate meaning of any track, classical, jazz, pop or soul.\n\nAnd there\u2019s something else to tell: Musica Nuda is the art of enjoying the silence in music, a basic and often underrated aspect of it, that leads to the true emotion and underline the value or a lyric, a story, the meaning of every single song, no matter if it\u2019s dramatic, funny, energetic, romantic, sarcastic.\n\nIn MUSICA NUDA we have two different yet perfectly complementary artists like Petra Magoni and Ferruccio Spinetti, that face each others musically with complicity and sense of humor that stand for themselves.\n\nA voice (Petra\u2019s) that performs great emotions, a double bass (Ferruccio\u2019s) that becomes orchestra.\n\nWith easyness, humbleness, commitment, devotion and deep love for past, present and future music, for the music that\u2019s been forgotten and has to be re-discovered (it\u2019s the case of the successful \u201cIl cammello e il dromedario\u201d by Virgilio Savona).\n\nIn 6 years The pair has produced 3 studio albums:\n\n\u201cMUSICA NUDA\u201d, RECORDED IN 2003 BUT RELEASED A YEAR LATER, AN ALBUM MADE IN ONE AFTERNOON AND CLOSE TO THE 50.000 COPIES SOLD\n\u201cMUSICA NUDA 2\u201d, A DOUBLE ALBUM RELEASED IN 2006, WITH MANY SPECIAL GUESTS LIKE STEFANO BOLLANI, FAUSTO MESOLELLA, NICOLA STILO, ERIK TRUFFAZ.\n\u201cMUSICA NUDA 55/21\u201d, RELEASED IN 2008 FOR THE WELL KNOWN LABEL BLUE NOTE.\n\nPrevNext\n\n12345678910\nIt\u2019s also important to mention \u201cQUAM DILECTA (2006), a sacred music album recorded in the church of San Nicola in Pisa, where Petra used to sing as a child, and \u201cMusica Nuda live \u00e0 Fip\u201d(2007), a live album recorded at the Auditorium de Radio France in Parigi, in February 2007.\n\nIn June 2006 the dvd \u201cMusica Nuda \u2013 Live in Paris\u201d went out in stores, including a full concert and a beautiful portrait interview with the two guys.\n\nTaking part to a MUSICA NUDA concert is just like entering a new and unexpected musical and emotional dimension, where the voice of Petra Magoni and the double bass of Ferruccio Spinetti charm the listener, leading him in a world of sounds that he will not want to leave.\n\nThe setlist for MUSICA NUDA is composed by new songs from last album \u201cCOMPLICI\u201d, some classics and great covers that their audience requests on every live date (Guarda che luna, Il cammello e il dromedario, Come together) and also unreleased tracks like come Tu, forse non essenzialmente tu by Rino Gaetano or Arrivano i cinesi by Bruno Lauzi.\n\nMUSICA NUDA tour never really stopped, Petra Magoni and Ferruccio Spinetti introduced their project in important festivals all over the world, performing on all the main stages in Italy and in the most prestigious international locations like Paris Olympia Theatre and in all main cities like Madrid, Tunisi, Salzburg, New York, Toronto, Pechino, St Petersburg, Quito in Ecuador, in Holland, in Poland and so on.\n\nThey\u2019ve been hosted by the Tanz Wuppertal Festival of Pina Bausch and always in Germany they supported Al Jarreau with an amazing response from the audience.\n\nAt the meantime Petra performed as The Queen Of The Night in \u201cIl Flauto Magico secondo l\u2019Orchestra di Piazza Vittorio\u201d, solo voice in the sacred concerts of Duke Ellington with the Big Band of Rome Auditorium and the Choir of Accademia di Santa Cecilia, while Ferruccio produced together with Giovanni Ceccarelli the album \u201cInventaRio\u201d, a musical connection between Italy and Brazil with the guitar player Dadi Carvalho and many special guests like Petra herself, Pacifico, Marisa Monte and Ivan Lins.", "otherInfo": "Stanford:\n\nBing Studio\nStanford University\n327 Lasuen Street\nStanford, California 94305\n\nSunday, November 17, 2019 -

With lyrical poetry splashing like dazzling paint across a canvas of sound, she builds layer upon layer of vocal melodies into majestic loop-pedal harmonies, weaving syncopated threads of guitar, kalimba, piano, and percussion into her live performances.\n\nAyla\u2019s music is a genre unto its own, as she allows sounds to dance between vocal looping, produced beats, live drumming, orchestral string arrangements, Celtic melodies, and even dashes of hip-hop wordplay. With an uncanny ability to disarm and crack open the heart, Ayla\u2019s lucid storytelling and magical presence rings with love, as she sings for the depth of our humanness, a truth beyond time and place, and the pure wonder of life itself.\n\nCalling us to listen deeper, her songs are elegant masterpieces of lucid storytelling, with lyrics ringing as anthems and mantras for hope, healing, and love.\n\nThough you\u2019d never know it by witnessing her perform, Ayla grew up with a deep fear of singing. In her final year of college, songs began pouring through her, and it was only through the constant urging of those around her that she began to slowly share her music. Propelled by the songs themselves, Ayla\u2019s journey of meeting those fears and singing through them has propelled her into the powerful performer she is today, touching an ever-widening global audience with the inspiring magic of her songs.\n\nA child schooled at home in the hills of Sonoma County, Ayla was raised on Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, opera, classical music, traditional celtic songs, and ABBA -- influences which have deeply shaped her music. Touching on both the timeless and modern, she always rides the line between genres, so that her songwriting and sound ultimately cannot be compared to anyone else.\n\nDancing her own songs on stage as she sings them, her movement and presence gives the audience a permission to be wild, real, vulnerable, and alive. Every performance Ayla gives is its own inspired journey; an enchanting and poignant experience that holds you by the heart and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\nAyla is releasing her 6th album in the spring of 2019 via Jumpsuit Records. Honing her artistry and craft over the years, Ayla has developed a loyal fanbase, one that has recently seen exponential growth into widening circles across the planet. The upcoming release of her phenomenal new album, \"By The Light of the Dark Moon\", marks a stepping-out into the world arena. With a nationwide tour supporting the album release, a full summer of notable festival appearances, and her second European tour on the horizon, Ayla's music is reverberating from a west-coast transformational niche into larger global audiences, to inspire and uplift the hearts of humanity. Her music has also recently seen rapid and increasing growth throughout Europe, as well as Canada, Australia, and dozens of other countries.\n\nTo date, Ayla has released 5 solo albums, 2 Wildlight albums (the collaboration project of Ayla and David Sugalski, aka The Polish Ambassador), and 3 collaboration albums.\n\n\u201cA poet, musician, visionary and mystic, Ayla Nereo is an otherworldly artist who shares the fruits of her soul.\u201d ~ The Huffington Post\n\n\u201c[Ayla\u2019s] relationship with the earth is imprinted in her music \u2026 thickly layered tracks where expansive and intriguing instrumentals serve as an intricate backdrop for her delicate and soft-spoken vocals.\u201d ~ Billboard\n\n\u201cI am here to receive songs that help us remember our origins, our incredible human potential, and our right relationship with all Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are born of dust and silence.

Hailed as \"America's best rock band\" by Greil Marcus in Time Magazine, and as \"America's best punk band ever. EVER\" by Rob Sheffield in Rolling Stone, the band put out seven searing albums in 10 years before going on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Almost a decade later, the trio--guitarists/vocalists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, and drummer Janet Weiss--has come back together for 2015's No Cities To Love. Tucker and Brownstein met in 1992 and formed Sleater-Kinney in a brick duplex in Olympia, WA in 1994. Students at Evergreen State College and members of bands Heavens To Betsy and Excuse 17, respectively, Tucker and Brownstein built Sleater-Kinney from the fire and feminism of their riot grrrl experience with a language and sound all their own. Named for a road in a neighboring town, Sleater-Kinney recorded their 22-minute, 1995 self-titled debut in a single day on a trip to Australia. With drummer Laura MacFarlane, Sleater-Kinney planted the seeds of the band's distinctive sound, defined by Tucker's urgent vocals and the remarkable interplay between her and Brownstein's guitars. With 1996's Call The Doctor, on Donna Dresch's punk label Chainsaw, Sleater-Kinney was no longer the side project it had been when it formed, and the band's songwriting and dynamic gained even more clarity. Brownstein took on more vocal duties, and the give and take of two powerful voices joined that of the guitars. Tucker and Brownstein honed their process of writing songs together, which Brownstein says is \"very specific and unique because the parts are relational to the other person.\" Along with the its pointed social messages, the album eviscerated the idea that rock godhood belonged to men alone with \"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone.\" Call The Doctor also brought Sleater-Kinney together with John Goodmanson, who would go on to produce several of the band's albums including No Cities To Love. That same year, in need of a new drummer, Tucker and Brownstein met Jr. High and Quasi's Janet Weiss through mutual friends. During their first practice with Weiss, the guitarists brought out a new song called \"Dig Me Out,\" and Weiss wrote the fierce, solid drum part that would set Sleater-Kinney's ongoing fiery chemistry in motion. \"I always considered Corin and Carrie to be musical soulmates in the tradition of the greats,\" says Weiss, whose job, she says, is to \"take their flourishing parts and melodies and push them as far as I can.\" This extraordinary formula crystalized on 1997's breakout set Dig Me Out, which brought the band to Kill Rock Stars and again had Goodmanson in the production seat. More pop-leaning than previous records but every bit as hard-hitting, Dig Me Out confidently took on both pleasure and pain with anthems like \"Turn It On\" and \"One More Hour.\" Sleater-Kinney's breakneck pace continued with The Hot Rock in 1999 and All Hands on the Bad One in 2000. The former, produced by Roger Moutenot, stepped down the band's velocity but not its intensity or complexity; the latter brought John Goodmanson back to the boards for hook-laden, lucidly feminist songs including \"#1 Must Have,\" \"Male Model\" and \"You're No Rock and Roll Fun.\" In 2001, Sleater-Kinney took a break while Tucker and husband Lance Bangs became parents to son Marshall. The events around his premature birth, as well as the September 11th terrorist attacks, in part influenced 2002's critically acclaimed One Beat. A political and anxious record, One Beat is also supercharged and strident, facing life and death from the band's singular perspective. Three years later, in need of a new setting and musical focus, the band signed with Sub Pop and enlisted Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann for 2005's The Woods. Recorded in the literal woods of upstate New York, Sleater-Kinney's final record before their hiatus took the band to significantly different musical landscapes, drawing on classic and improvisational rock as well as self-imposed discomfort and unfamiliarity. The following year, Sleater-Kinney announced an indefinite break and played a triumphant, bittersweet farewell show at Portland's Crystal Ballroom on August 12, 2006. \"It was kind of a perfect storm between the anxiety and stress of touring, and parenting,\" says Tucker of the need for the hiatus. \"Those are challenging issues, and they will continue to challenge us, but I think the time off has given us a chance to come up with some different tools for managing them.\" And with those tools, as well as a decade of broad creative experience, Sleater-Kinney has created No Cities To Love. \"We sound possessed on these songs,\" says Brownstein. \"Willing it all--the entire weight of the band and what it means to us---back into existence.\" The result is a record that grapples with love, power and redemption without restraint. \"The three of us want the same thing,\" says Weiss. \"We want the songs to be daunting.\" Sleater-Kinney's decade apart made room for family and other fruitful collaborations, as well as an understanding of what the band's rare chemistry demands. \"Creativity is about where you want your blood to flow, because in order to do something meaningful and powerful there has to be life inside of it,\" says Brownstein. \"Sleater-Kinney isn't something you can do half-assed or half-heartedly. We have to really want it. This band requires a certain desperation, a direness. We have to be willing to push because the entity that is this band will push right back.\" \"The core of this record is our relationship to each other, to the music, and how all of us still felt strongly enough to about those to sweat it out in the basement and to try and reinvent our band,\" adds Tucker.

Produced by Cameron Webb, who was behind the helm of 2009\u2019s Agents Of The Underground, it\u2019s a record that brims with the same ferocious fire the band had at the very start of its career when front man Jason Cruz was still a teenager, but which also demonstrates how far the California five-piece have evolved as songwriters, musicians and people.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be 19 years old again,\u201d says Cruz, \u201cbut the fact that we still have that energy, but we\u2019re not 19 years old is a real feather in our cap. We\u2019re older, but I\u2019m so grateful that I still have a lot to do. I hope people hear this record, and they know that we\u2019re not tired, that I still have ideas.\u201d\n\nThose ideas flow throughout this record both musically and thematically, the vulnerability and uncertainty of Cruz\u2019s lyrics lying in stark contrast to the fierce and ferocious pummeling nature of its songs. That juxtaposition has always been present in Strung Out\u2019s songs, but for this record, that push and pull has become the central basis and focus of this record, as his heart and thoughts struggle to make sense of the chaos of the world at large. That\u2019s not to say this album has the answers, but in analyzing everything, it offers the listener \u2013 and Cruz himself \u2013 the various contradictory paths of life that, hopefully, can lead to some kind of truth or understanding.\n\u201cSome songs can be armor: they can repel and they can guard you,\u201d explains Cruz. \u201cAnd they can also bring you comfort and speak of love and belonging to something. To be a good and gentle person, you have to put up a little bit of armor, but that armor never works, because you\u2019re so caring and sensitive and vulnerable, that your heart is going to be displayed on that armor anyway. There are so many thoughts and feelings in my head I think that with this album I just opened up the pen and let it go to explore the duality of having to defend and protect what\u2019s inside, and at the same time make it available for the world.\u201d\nMuch of Cruz\u2019s vulnerability stems from the death of someone he was incredibly close to. That\u2019s something which has exaggerated and exacerbated Cruz\u2019s emotional fragility and continues the spiritual and philosophical journey he says he\u2019s found himself on in recent years. At the same time, though, these songs are also infused with a spirit of hope and defiance.\n\u201cI lost my best friend six or seven months ago,\u201d explains Cruz. \u201cIt was right before we started writing this record, and that really put a shadow on things. Some of these songs \u2013 especially \u201cMonuments\u201d and \u201cBloody Knuckles\u201d \u2013 reflect that loss. But that\u2019s what\u2019s always made our band work. The music is this metal machine and then you get these vocals that express this vulnerability in a melodic way \u2013 and there\u2019s love and there\u2019s searching in all that machine. This record starts out hopeful and then it kind of degrades. It sobers and ends with loss. But there are so many things on this record that I\u2019m still figuring it out.\u201d\nAll those thoughts and feelings swirl together on this record as Cruz \u2013 who refers to himself and his vulnerability as the \u201cflesh in the machine\u201d \u2013 tries to find some sort of resolution. The moody \u201cDaggers\u201d tells a story of personal turmoil within the backdrop of an increasingly dystopian America, while the grief and sadness contained with \u201cMonuments\u201d is offset by the pulsating, defiant frenzy of the song\u2019s tune. \u201cDisappearing City\u201d blends a raucous energy with a sense of resignation but \u2013 importantly \u2013 not defeat, \u201cUnder The Western Sky\u201d brims with Strung Out\u2019s trademark sense of melody and coruscating aggression, and the insistent ebb and flow of album closer \u201cBloody Knuckles\u201d is ravaged with both a despair and a kind of beauty at the same time.\nYet while these songs are fuelled by a power and aggression, the band \u2013 completed by guitarists Jake Kiley and Rob Ramos, bassist Chris Aiken and new drummer (since 2018) RJ Shankle \u2013 infused them with plenty of nuance, too. Some of that is thanks to the lessons learned from last year\u2019s acoustic yet expansive acoustic EP Black Out The Sky, something Cruz says was a necessary step the band had to take in order to then make this record. Underneath it all, however, is the same desperate need to write these songs and get them out of his system.\n\u201cThis opportunity I\u2019ve been given, and everything I\u2019ve been doing, I don\u2019t have any say in it,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. I have to fucking do this. I have things inside of me that swell up when I go through this, but it\u2019s what people put into what they hear and what they then take out of it that\u2019s the magic. I need to do this, but if it\u2019s not making a connection, I have no right to be here. My favorite part about America is the pain of the poor people and what they create out of it \u2013 the culture that the poorest people of this country have created. From that came blues, jazz, rock n roll, and, to me, coming from nothing and creating something is everything to me.\u201d\nYou can hear how that is \u2013 how true that still is \u2013 from the beginning to the end of Songs Of Armor And Devotion. It\u2019s a punk record, but it\u2019s also much more than that. It\u2019s a political record that addresses the state we\u2019re in, but at its core is a heart and humanity \u2013and a belief in that humanity \u2013 that overrides everything else. It\u2019s pain and sadness and hope and rebellion all wrapped into one powerful statement that also serves as a culmination of the band\u2019s three decades together. And while the record sees Strung Out still writing at the height of their abilities, at the same time, when Cruz reflects back on these songs, he thinks they represent something monumental for the band, even if he\u2019s not entirely sure what that actually is.\n\u201cI find that it\u2019s time for a new adventure,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve given what I needed to give to Strung Out. I feel like we did what we needed to do and it\u2019s time to move on. I\u2019ve grown. I\u2019m not angry like I used to be \u2013 I feel like this was the end of something, and now it\u2019s time for a new life. I look back on the record and I think \u2018Done.\u2019 For me personally, it\u2019s a new beginning. We still have a lot left and as long as we listen to each other and we care about what each other has to say, I don\u2019t see an end for Strung Out. I just don\u2019t want to repeat things that I\u2019ve done. I can\u2019t write like that anymore.\u201d\n\nStrungOutOfficial.com", "otherInfo": "Strung Out"}, {"Address": "128 American Alley, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Divided Heaven", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9066409.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.64144, 38.23508], "Date": "Sun Nov 17 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-17", "Genre": "Genres: singer-songwriter, Punk, Indie, Folk, Pop Rock, rock n roll", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Big Easy", "moreBioInfo": "By this point, all the experience of years on the road and the balance of tour-life versus home-life, lead Berman to this next chapter of DIVIDED HEAVEN: Cold War. This third album, due out Summer 2018 and once again produced by Charlie Stavish, hits hard; musically, lyrically and emotionally. Contemplative, heartbreaking, raw and ambitious; Cold War captures Berman's life in the realm of wild coexistence, a reconciliation attempt with the better angels of his personal and our collective nature. Cold War shows Berman's songwriting at its finest and most poetic. The lead single '1983', the hauntingly desperate 'Love Letter To New York' and the powerful #MeToo anthem 'The Daughters & The Sons' are the strongest and infectiously catchy full-band songs in the DIVIDED HEAVEN canon. Juxtaposed, the subdued tracks, 'Maeby, We Should Say Goodbye' and 'Dance With Old Habits' are the darkest, most sorrowful and vulnerable of his career; speaking to mourning, separation, depression, anxiety and addiction. Cold War's sonic landscape is much different from previous releases; recorded to two-inch tape at Stavish's Clock Tower Recording studio in Joshua Tree, California and mixed to the board, dripping in a plethora of analog effects.\n\n\n\nOn the eve of the release of Cold War, DIVIDED HEAVEN stands as a band on the verge of a new beginning. The path that led Berman and his bandmate, Nic Morreale, to now has not been clear of casualties, trials, tribulations or successes. The 13 tracks on Cold War are aimed to bring harmony to those past experiences and be the foundation for DIVIDED HEAVEN to carry on as genuine and singular rock 'n roll band; working-hard, paying dues and catching your ear.\n\ndividedheaven.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Sam Houston", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9595698.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Sun Nov 17 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Shawn James"}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Carminho", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7195504.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Sun Nov 17 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-17", "Genre": "Genres: Fado", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "SFJazz Center", "moreBioInfo": "BOOKING ruibraga@ruelamusic.com | +351 219 249 249 | +351 966 781 126 MANAGEMENT joaopedroruela@ruelamusic.com | +351 219 249 249", "otherInfo": "Carminho Carminho is heir to the fado legacy as the daughter of renowned fadista Teresa Siqueira.

In that\ntime, singer-songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Karin Bergquist and Linford\nDetweiler (who've been married for 22 years) have built a vivid,\nemotionally-charged body of work that has won them a deeply devoted following\nand critical acclaim.\nLike its predecessors, Love & Revelation showcases the pair's timeless songcraft\nand understated yet soulful delivery. Those qualities are prominent on such\nmemorable new songs as \"Los Lunas,\" \"Let You Down,\" \"Broken Angels\" and\n\"Making Pictures,\" whose insistent melodies and striking lyrical imagery haunt\nthe listener long after the music fades.\nThe 11-song Love & Revelation, which the rural Ohio-based duo and their \u201cBand\nof Sweethearts\u201d recorded with longtime engineer Ryan Freeland at his Stampede\nOrigin studio in Culver City, CA, continues Over the Rhine's career-long embrace\nof its unmistakable creative values.\n\"Each record we've released is authentic to a particular time in our lives,\"\nDetweiler notes. \"They're all mile markers on a long road that beckoned to us in\nour youth. Karin did a lot of the heavy lifting on this record in terms of the\nsongwriting and really set the tone for the project. We help edit each other's\nwork, and it was so great to sit at the kitchen table together and let songs come\nfully into being. It's not always easy, but it is rewarding, and ultimately very\nintimate work. I'm so grateful for our musical connection at this point in our lives\nand marriage.\"\nAlthough the duo's usual producer, Joe Henry, was unavailable to work on the\nnew album due to a writing sabbatical in Ireland, many of Love & Revelation\u2019s\nall-star cast of musicians originally came to Over the Rhine via Henry:\nJay Bellerose, drums, percussion\nJennifer Condos, hollow-body bass\nGreg Leisz, electric guitar, pedal steel, mandolin\nPatrick Warren, keyboards, string arrangements\nBradley Meinerding, electric guitar, mandolin\nHenry's influence is also felt in Love & Revelation's title. Bergquist continues:\n\"Joe always used to sign off in his emails and letters with 'Love & Revelation, JH.'\nIt was a little blessing he would offer\u2014his wish, I suppose, being that anyone\nwho came into his circle would know love and be open to being surprised. The\n\nphrase became important to us, and we asked Joe if we could use it for the name\nof the record. He quickly gave us his blessing.\"\nEven after three decades of record-making, Bergquist and Detweiler still find\nfulfillment and inspiration in the creative process. \"The poet Christina Rosetti has\na poem that begins, Does the road wind up hill all the way?,\" Bergquist explains,\n\"She assures us that it does indeed, until the very end, but there are surprising\nrewards along the way nonetheless. We don't know that it ever really gets easier.\nBut we will say the actual recording of the songs is a joy, and is something that\nwe just get caught up in. The lion's share of this record was recorded in just three\ndays, with a sympathetic group of musicians leaning in together. It's something\nyou can get high on for weeks. But writing songs, the mixing process and\nfine-tuning things toward the end\u2014it can be a bit harrowing as well.\"\n\"Priorities change as the years pass,\" Detweiler observes. \"There's a line in one\nof the new songs, 'Betting on the Muse,' The fact that you still make me laugh is\nwhat I'm most proud of. That's probably the best definition of success we can\ncome up with at the moment. Thank God we're still laughing.\"\n\"But honestly, there is a fair amount of grieving on this record too,\" Detweiler\nadds. \"We aren't kids anymore, and we've buried people we love over the years.\nNobody gets out of this world alive.\u201d\n\"One song that I had been working on for years is 'Los Lunas,'\" Bergquist notes.\n\"It ended up being the first track on the record, and the narrator in the song\nstates a simple fact at the outset: I cried all the way from Los Lunas to Santa Fe.\nWe realized that we were grieving. And I think a lot of people are. Why are we\ngrieving? We've lost loved ones. We've seen our friends struggling with loss\u2014the\nloss of a child, or a partner. We've seen friends and family members struggling\nwith chronic illness, or a daunting cancer diagnosis. As Willie Nelson wrote in\none of his recent songs, It's not something you get over, it's just something you\nget through. A lot of these new songs are coming to terms with our realization\nthat certain losses will be carried with us for the rest of our lives.\"\n\"We know a lot of people turn on the news and are in shock at what they are\nseeing,\" says Detweiler. \"Beneath that shock is grief. We are grieving the fact\nthat we aren't quite sure who we are anymore as Americans. Things are shifting\nand being revealed.\u201d\n\"But then the record takes a turn,\" Bergquist points out. \"Some things haven't\nchanged. We still believe in love and revelation. We still believe in meaningful\nwork. We keep going, and with the darkness falling, we still find reason to\ndance.\"\n\nThat attitude is shared by Over the Rhine's audience, which continues to\nembrace the duo's music with a heartfelt intensity that transcends mere fandom.\n\"We think of the people who have found our music less as fans, and more as\nextended musical family,\" says Bergquist. \"We didn't necessarily plan it this way,\nbut our music has been very effective at creating community. People who find\nour music tend to invite it into their big moments: falling in love, walking down the\naisle, giving birth, decorating for Christmas... All the way through to the hardest\nstuff, like a period of extended illness, putting loved ones in the ground and\nsaying goodbye.\"\nIndeed, every Memorial Day weekend, Bergquist and Detweiler host Nowhere\nElse Festival on their farm in Clinton County, Ohio, where they're in the process\nof transforming an historic 1870s barn into a performing arts center. The duo\ninvites a variety of musicians, writers, filmmakers and visual artists to join them\nfor a weekend of music, art and conversation. Those gatherings have been\ndescribed as extended musical family reunions for the band and its fans.\n\"There are different questions a young artist can ask,\" Detweiler observes. \"One\nis, 'What must I do to be famous?,' which swings the door open to all manner of\ndestructive forces from both within and without. Another question is, 'What must I\ndo to make this sustainable, to practice a craft for the long haul, to continue to\ngrow over the course of an entire lifetime?' The second question has always\nbeen far more interesting to us. And to make a career sustainable, we had to\nestablish a fair bit of independence early on.\u201d\n\"We can, and will, reflect on the last 30 years of making music, and we'll lift a\nglass in 2019 to our 30th anniversary to be sure,\" says Bergquist. \"But what's\nmost important and more interesting to us is to think about what's ahead: the next\n30 years.\u201d\n\"Eventually we want to record much of our music in the barn, host concerts,\nworkshops etc.,\" says Detweiler. \"Our big idea moving forward is: Wouldn't it be\ngreat to make music in front of a great live audience and then sleep in our own\nbeds every now and then?\u201d\n\"For years people have been telling us that they find our songs healing,\" says\nBergquist. \"Or they come to Nowhere Else Festival, and describe the weekend\nas 'healing.' It used to always surprise us. But in recent years we have\nexperienced it ourselves. We always feel better when the music starts. We can\nfeel our bodies change. We breathe easier.

This one costs more, but delivers the goods (they've even made the injera upscale), as does the cocktail list. Half the house cocktails are made with Ethiopian spiced bitters - and even the others are suitably named, such as the Abyssinian Storm (which is essentially a Dark and Stormy, but a really good one) - or you can order Tej, traditional honey wine.
