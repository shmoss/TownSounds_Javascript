Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5565 Tesla Rd, Livermore, CA 94550", "Artist": "Sunny And The Black Pack", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8910643.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.72537, 37.664735], "Date": "Sat Dec 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-07", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, R&B, Rock, Blues, Jazz Blues", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Wente Estate Tasting Room", "moreBioInfo": "Since 2015, Sunny And The Black Pack have been building a reputation as true visionaries in the music scene.

His warm vocals and authentic writing style combined with a bold grit give Chris James and the Showdowns that classic-infused deep-rooted Americana rock sound. Beginning as a local performer in Portland, Maine, James knew that he had to get his name heard in bigger cities. He left for San Francisco with nothing more than a guitar in hand to find work. Eventually, he joined forces with The Showdowns, a Bay Area-based group comprised of Matt Berg (drums), AJ Leighton (bass), John Paterson (keys), and Whitt Vicena (lead guitar). The unity amongst the band can be felt at every show through their synergized performances.\nSongs from their debut album, Lucky Breaks, and music from James\u2019 solo work have been played generously on SiriusXM Radio, radio stations throughout California, and placed in TV commercial promos. Chris James and the Showdowns\u2019 second album, Somewhere out in California, is authentic, dance-driven, heartfelt, and has been getting loads of attention from various media outlets. They have a packed tour schedule for the rest of the year, including full band and solo performances.\nDriving down the open road can get us lost in our thoughts when surrounded by the right views and accompanied by the right music. The title track off the album, \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d begins with an acoustic guitar solo then joined by elegant piano keys. The intimate video is characterized by the natural beauty of California: the views, the ocean, and the forests. \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d is the narration of a restless heart, reminiscing on all the possible \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of life. Every day we are forced to make hundreds of choices, big and small. After making a decision we sometimes have afterthoughts, imagining how life would be if different decisions were made and if different things were said. The lyric, \u201cDid you ever feel like we missed the bus\u201d is the metaphorical concern of making the wrong choices in the past and missing prime opportunities or possible new adventures. It is essential to remind ourselves to take risks: if not, we will regret all the possibilities that could\u2019ve been.\n\n--\"James' style of writing is hard to deny as it rings of times and life situations we can all relate to.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.\u201d - John Wooden\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s never been a question of talent with The Katinas. The Dove-award winning five-man band of Sam, Joe, James, John and Jesse have threaded a long, unbroken line of musical excellence and artistry through the years despite the pressures and uncertainties of the entertainment industry. But like the quote above describes, here is a group of men who truly understand the responsibility that comes with their God-given talents, platform and opportunities. They have fully grasped how to carefully handle them over two transformative decades.\n\n\n\nSince the days of their youth playing in their father\u2019s church worship band, the Katinas have always had a unique way of cutting through the noise and straight to people\u2019s hearts with their music. Perhaps it\u2019s their gorgeously crafted song arrangements. Maybe it\u2019s their lush Polynesian harmonies. It could be the warmth of their smiles and their authenticity onstage, offstage and backstage. Sure, there are other bands and artists trending atop the charts at the moment, but while they\u2019ll come and go, the Katinas remain the epitome of class and consistency.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Katinas are the most talented and genuinely kind and loving people I\u2019ve ever met. They continue to challenge themselves to stay on the edge of creative ingenuity without leaving their traditional core fan base behind. On top of all of this, they are absolutely top-level entertainers too. Their live concerts are something you would not ever want to miss.\u201d - Troy Collins, Co-Founder of Monroe-Collins Media Group\n\n\n\nTheir longevity is often the hallmark associated with the Katinas, but what sets them apart most from other music groups is their versatility. You would be hard-pressed to find a band more capable of providing a variety of audiences and venues with precisely the musical style and desired experience appropriate for the occasion.\n\n\n\nFrom Sunday morning services to Friday night rallies to corporate events to a capella sessions for prisoners to stadium-filled crusades, the Katinas bring experience that churches, organizations and leaders have come to trust. Having grown up in the islands and raising their own families stateside, their multicultural background has only complemented their effectiveness in cross-cultural outreach. Whether it\u2019s here in the United States or overseas in France, the Philippines, South Africa, Switzerland, Australia and many more countries, the Katinas\u2019 ministry has touched countless cities for over 25 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do our best to creatively present the Gospel message in a non-threatening yet non-compromising way to a variety of audiences. Our heart is to communicate the love of Jesus across a wide breadth of social, racial, economic and religious backgrounds. We don\u2019t bring a guilt-driven message of condemnation. We bring a message of inspiration.\u201d - Joe Katina\n\n\n\nNow more than ever, the Katinas\u2019 hearts have been moved to promote unity and love specifically among families. With 18 children (and counting) between the five brothers, they understand that Love (being Christ) is the key ingredient to fusing families together, and that our society\u2019s current fragility can only avoid collapse if the family unit, as God intended it, remains protected and intact. With the release of one of their more recent albums, Love Chapter, the mission of the Katinas is to deliver that message of hope, forgiveness and compassion to dads, moms and their children wherever they go. They have taken this family focus to stages and events across the United States, but they have also put it into action in the Dominican Republic (DR). Along with their wives and kids, the Katinas make the annual trek to the DR to minister to children in orphanages and the impoverished in remote villages.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known the Katinas for almost 25 years. Their love for God and people is evident in their lives and music.\u201d - Miles McPherson, Pastor at The Rock Church\n\n\n\nComing off the heels of their last two full-length albums, Collage and Love Chapter, the Katinas are taking fans back to their roots: worship. Sunday Set, the newest album added to an already notable collection, takes us on a musical journey where both band and congregation can \u201cgo vertical\u201d in their adoration and praise. It\u2019s a fresh Katina-esque spin on today\u2019s popular worship songs for you, your family and your church to enjoy. Sunday Set is a refreshing return to that unmistakable sound that has connected the Katinas to God and others throughout the decades.\n\n\n\nIt can be tempting for anyone to just sit on the laurels and achievements of the past and hope they have enough steam to carry one over into the next chapter of life. But that\u2019s not the case for this band. Going forward, expect the Katinas to keep seeking out the next phase in God\u2019s plans, cranking out top-notch music and building off a formula that has kept them relevant and successful throughout the years, based on that opening quote by John Wooden:\n\n\n\n\u201cConceit is self-given.

Since that time, Fields has toured the world with musical legends like Kool and the Gang, Sammy Gordon and the Hip-Huggers, O.V Wright, Darrell Banks, and Little Royal. Recorded with French house DJ/producer Martin Solveig. And somehow found a newer, younger audience and become more prolific as the years transpire. \"In a curious case of musical evolution, the older Fields becomes, the closer he gets to perfecting the sound of soul that he grew up with as a young man,\" noted NPR music writer Oliver Wang (and that was back in 2009).. Now Fields returns with his most triumphant and honest record yet, Special Night, recorded with The Expressions and released on Brooklyn\u2019s Big Crown Records. Special Night follows the the critical success of his Truth & Soul recordings My World, Faithful Man and 2014\u2019s Emma Jean \u2014 the last one American Songwriter hailing as \u201cmore than just a stroll down memory lane ... it\u2019s the sound of a man who understands his musical strengths and plays to them with class, authority and soul searching intensity.\u201d You\u2019ll hear Fields flexing those strengths on Special Night. There\u2019s some JB-style funk on there. And hints of Stax, Chess, Fame and Motown. But this is not a throwback. Possessing a voice that\u2019s equally raucous and tender, Fields crafts a truly honest, soulful work. \u201cThis is a record about what people do in real life,\u201d says the singer. For one example, he cites the yearning \u201cWork to Do,\u201d which entails a \u201ca guy going to counseling, drinking too much, apologizing to the old lady and trying to keep family together, doing the manly thing.\u201d Adds Fields: \u201cWhen I record, I make every song like I actually mean it. I mean every word I say. On Special Night I\u2019m talking to my lady \u2014 literally, expressing the way I feel. You can tell if a song is real or not. And every moment I\u2019m recording, those moments are real.\u201d Meanwhile, album standout \u201cMake This World\u201d works both as militaristic funk and a cautionary tale about the health of the planet. \u201cThe world was designed to last indefinitely,\u201d says Fields. \u201cAnd we\u2019re the only living species on Earth who can alter that process. I\u2019m hoping that song has a chain reaction, helps somebody put into action whatever contribution they can to change what the world is going through.\u201d Fields and his six-piece band will tour in the fall, where he notes the audiences seem tgrowing and changing. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a younger crowd,\u201d he notes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a blessing.\u201d As for his late success? Fields regrets nothing. \u201cI was already talking to myself in the beginning of my career about the end of my career,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a little naive, so I told myself, \u2018Think about the future in every song you make. Make things you can live with. Everything you do has consequences.\u2019 And today, I live like I\u2019ve always lived.\u201d A credo that continues with Special Night. \u201cAll the songs on that record have special meaning,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope people take a good listen to it and find the magic.\u201d Check us out on Twitter @leefields12 and Instagram @leefieldsandtheexpressions", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2284 San Pablo Ave, Pinole, CA 94564", "Artist": "Chronic Vitality", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8980484.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.291156, 38.005608], "Date": "Sat Dec 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-07", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Antlers Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "Chronic Vitality is an exciting rock band that is dedicated to putting on an amazing show enriched with high-energy and musicianship.

I felt stagnant and unsure of what to do next.\"\n\nThat anxiety eventually thawed and gave way to a newfound sense of freedom as Tamko began to focus less on industry pressures and more on honing her craft as a songwriter and producer. \"With this album, I wanted to impress myself,\" Tamko says. \"I wanted to be curious and I wanted to make big leaps as a producer. All I had access to on the road was my computer and Logic, so naturally I started writing songs electronically with what was at hand.\"\n\nAll The Women In Me was written and produced entirely by Tamko. Guitar-driven melodies are largely absent, and in their place we are treated to a collection of songs buoyed by hybridized analog and digital arrangements. While Infinite Worlds situated the last Vagabon project in the realm of \"indie rock,\" All The Women In Me is not easily defined. Grounded by Tamko's expressive voice and knack for unique melodies, the album flits between genres, never lingering too long on one particular sensibility.\n\nLead single \"Flood Hands\" exemplifies this growth; the production ebbs like a gentle tide before a cavernous drumbeat kicks in and the tone shifts completely. \"I know, even if I run from it I'm still in it,\" Tamko sings over and over again, her capacious voice conveying a sense of resignation in the face of an external force beyond her control. The chorus is a hypnotic bit of pop alchemy that lingers long after the runtime.\n\n\"The drums and vocal forward approach I took on All The Women In Me is drawn from my love for rap and hip-hop production as well as R&B and folk storytelling. That's the music that got me excited about writing again,\" Tamko says. In addition to those influences, the West African guitars and rhythms that soundtracked much of her childhood seep into moments throughout this album, in no place more obvious than on \"In A Bind.\" The song opens with a fingerpicked melody as Tamko sings to someone she's been orbiting for a while but can't quite reach. \"I know that I was gone a lot last year/ But I hoped you'd still be here,\" she sings. After that, words no longer serve, and lyrics are replaced by robust, choral vocals singing the refrain: \"Uh-huh, yes, uh-huh.\"\n\n\"I drew some inspiration from the Malian musician Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 while writing that song. There is a part on his song 'Savane' where he and his band are feeling the music so much that he just says, 'Yes,' in the middle of the track,\" Tamko explains. \"It's almost as if the music is coming from a higher power. That's a staple in so much of the African music I love, and when I started writing 'In a Bind' I was overcome in a similar way.\"\n\nTamko didn't set out with one particular lyrical theme in mind when she started writing All The Women In Me, and as a result, this album offers up a spectrum of moods to marinate in. Songs like the album's opener \"Full Moon In Gemini,\" the thumping bedroom dance track \"Water Me Down,\" and the collage piece \"Please Don't Leave The Table\" illustrate blinding moments of personal insight that speak to universal themes. Other lyrics came to Tamko with clear intention. Inspired by a Nayyirah Waheed poem, the title track, \"All The Women,\" is a thesis statement, though it arrives near the very end of the album.\n\n\"This song poured out of me and showed itself as an anthem for myself and for all of the people who are marginalized by our society. 'Women' in this case isn't gendered, it's a placeholder for those who are not always welcome and not always protected. This song exists for all of us to see each other and find each other,\" Tamko says. \"The song is also a thank-you letter to the women who raised me, the women who look like me, the women who work in all of the genres of music that guided this album, 'the women who run with the wolves.'\"\n\nOn \"Wits About You,\" Tamko opens up more space for those who have found themselves positioned as The Other when she sings: \"I was invited to the party/ They won't let my people in/ Well then never mind, never mind, never mind.\" Later, the stunning slow burn \"Home Soon\" finds Tamko meditating on what it feels like to truly belong to a place, a community. She's joined by a consortium of friends, who sing along with her over a trembling string arrangement. \"At dawn, I'll be home soon,\" they affirm in unison.\n\n\"Home has always been a major theme in my music, and when I say I make music for outcasts, I am also talking about those who feel far from home or uncomfortable where they're at,\" Tamko says. \"To me, home isn't a physical space so much as it is a mental state. I'm writing about wanting to feel safe and at home in my body and in my mind and in the community I move in. I want Vagabon to be a project that people searching for the same thing can connect with.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Gabriela Penka", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Dec 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "*The Slackers"}, {"Address": "412 14th St, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Paul Luc", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9632547.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.270302, 37.804256], "Date": "Sat Dec 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-07", "Genre": "Genres: Singer-Songwriter", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Golden Bull Bar", "moreBioInfo": "From the outside, Paul Luc\u2019s story is seemingly normal. Born and raised in Pittsburgh, he started playing guitar and joined a garage band in high school; from there, he attended a small college just south of the city, studied economics, and got a business job in healthcare. On the weekends, he'd play local shows, write music, and even put out his first album. But after years of working a grueling 9-5, Luc woke up one day, tired, bored, and unhappy with his situation -- and without a plan, quit corporate America. Since then, he\u2019s harnessed his full energy toward making music. He\u2019s toured throughout the country and caught the ear of the Americana world. As he gears up to release his third album, Paul Luc\u2019s story has rapidly grown into one with an authentic sound and relatable message for the masses.\n\nLuc\u2019s love for music dates back to early childhood, when he found his parent\u2019s record collection at age five, \u201cI'd sit there with big, olive green headphones on, spiral cord plugged into the stereo, just caught up in the sounds.\u201d Those early influences aren\u2019t hard to hear in his music; traces of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, John Lennon, The Band, and Elton John are uniquely weaved throughout his melodies. And by elementary school, he'd gained a brand new perspective of music from mentor and well-known jazz saxophonist Don Aliquo. \u201cHe would pick up things quicker, and you could see he had talent,\u201d Aliquo says, \u201cIt was very evident to me he had talent over and above most of the kids in the class.\u201d Luc studied trumpet under Aliquo for years, before eventually finding guitar in high school and touring regionally with his rock band, Simon. But Aliquo\u2019s support, the skill set he learned, and the importance of music were things that would never leave Luc, along with his myriad of influences.\n\nIn 2014, Luc came in full force with the release of his second full-length album, Tried & True. The ten-track album caught the attention of major, mainstream radio station WDVE, who championed the record and played it on heavy rotation. The album showcased Luc\u2019s ability to merge upbeat rhythms with brutally-honest and relatable lyrics. When he was ready to start his newest project, Bad Seed, Luc turned to Dave Hidek, the same Pittsburgh producer that helped him the attain the folk rock sound in Tried & True. But this time around, the duo wanted to attempt the unknown; they formulated a plan to travel to Nashville, TN, and decided to recruit musicians that they'd never met, much less worked with. \u201cI had this sort of romantic idea. I\u2019d see photos of songwriters and musicians on a studio floor together, no computers, just doing things in that moment, which is probably what made the records that a lot of us idolize so great,\u201d Luc says, \u201cSo I got this idea that I wanted to get acquaintances or strangers together and just do that.\u201d\n\nRecorded at Welcome to 1979 Studios, Luc might've gambled -- but didn\u2019t place his bets on just anyone. The lineup of Nashville badasses featured on Bad Seed includes bassist Cameron Carrus, drummer Paul Griffith (John Prine, Jason Isbell, k.d. lang), backing vocals from Leah Blevins, and pianist Jefferson Crow and guitar/pedal steel player Laur \u201cLil\u2019 Joe\u201d Joamets, both part of Sturgill Simpson\u2019s band from the iconic 2016 album A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth. And while his studio lineup turned out to be a recruitment of some of Music City\u2019s most valued players, Luc was working on a tight timeline and budget, \u201cWe had no rehearsal time, we didn\u2019t rehearse at all actually,\u201d he says, \u201cSo we decided to record to tape, it gives you less options to change things. It forces you to make decisions.\u201d\n\nBut even with an abundance of unknown variables, Bad Seed found its way. \u201cIt would either work or it wouldn\u2019t. Luckily, it really did. We all clicked and worked things out take-by-take.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to ignore that Bad Seed was fated for success, not only because of Luc taking a chance on the setup, but also his ability to organically build songs. While in the studio, Joamets even dubbed his songwriting \u2018healing\u2019 which Luc hopes to achieve with Bad Seed, \u201cI try to write about personal experience, and people usually relate in their own unexpected ways. There\u2019s something beautiful about music and the unpredictable ways it connects people.\u201d And if anything, that\u2019s what Bad Seed is -- proof that even out of the unknown, something beautiful can surface.", "otherInfo": "Solo tour with Sammy Kay, Chad Price, and Kevin Seconds!"}, {"Address": "1350 3rd St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Ryan McKasson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7869345.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.287516, 38.296479], "Date": "Sat Dec 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Uptown Theatre Napa", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2045 Mt Diablo St, Concord, CA 94520", "Artist": "Monophonics", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9668147.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.035203, 37.977805], "Date": "Sat Dec 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-07", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, R&B, soul, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Vinnie's Bar & Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Monophonics are just hitting their stride as one of the premier soul bands in the country. The Bay Area band delivers cinematic songs with timeless hooks anchored by Kelly Finnigan\u2019s soulful organ and powerhouse vocals. Their sound is inspired equally by classic soul, heavy funk, psychedelic rock, and classic American songwriting. The band\u2019s main members live just North of San Francisco, CA in Marin county, a place revered among artists, surfers, hippies and musicians; three of them grew up here. The band members simultaneously revere and honor the Bay Area\u2019s colorblind and highly diverse musical tradition that dates back to Haight/Ashbury\u2019s psychedelic revolution and Sly Stone and the Family Stone\u2019s multiracial, funky grab-bag. Soulful vocals, funky drum-breaks, psychedelic guitar licks and fuzz bass intermingle effortlessly across the band\u2019s catalogue, most effortlessly on their newest EP: \u035eMirrors\u035f. Mirrors delivers a six-song fix to fiending fans and curious newcomers in advance of a new Monophonics full-length later in 2018. The release is all cover tunes with some well-known songs mixed in with some seriously deep cuts, all band favorites. \u035eSound of Sinning\u035f (Transistor Sound Records, 2015), the band\u2019s second full-length album since lead singer, producer and keyboard player, Kelly Finningan joined the band.\n\nEvolving from their psychedelic soul roots with \u035eIn Your Brain,\u035f (Ubiquity, 2012), \u035eSound of Sinning\u035f displays the bands\u2019 appreciation for classic song craft and Summer of Love pop-soul-psychedelia. Monophonics\u2019 meticulous, yet raw recordings start just like their raucous and soulful live shows, \u035ein the same room, cutting live as a rhythm section together,\u035f Finnigan explains. Ryan Scott and Mike Rinta\u2019s horn and string arrangements add accents and sonic colors to the tracks, completing the soul symphony. In the tradition of Stax, Muscle Shoals, Daptone and Dunham, Monophonics\u2019 sonic approach is equal parts classic analog gear, (everything\u2019s recorded to an old Tascam eight-track 1/4\u035f tape machine), old-fashioned woodshedding, and Ian McDonald and Kelly Finnigan\u2019s late night overdubs and studio wizardry. \u035eWe\u2019re from the same school as the producers from the studios we love. We use the tools that we have to make the best records we can.\u035fBaked-in to any Monophonics record there\u2019s a vibe, that elusive element that lesser bands can\u2019t fake, as Kelly Finnigan put it: \u035eI think it\u2019s having people who are all on the same page, striving to capture that musical moment and being honest in their playing and being thoughtful and putting their ego to the side to serve the song.\u035fMonophonics is Austin Bohlman (Drums), Ian McDonald (Guitar/Background Vocals), Ryan Scott (Trumpet/Back- ground Vocals/Percussion) & Kelly Finnigan (Keys/Lead Vocals) along with Max Ramey (Bass).", "otherInfo": "A Funky soulful ride"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "The Slackers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8154583.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Dec 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-07", "Genre": "Genres: Ska, Reggae", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "*The Slackers"}, {"Address": "691 Broadway, Sonoma, CA 95476", "Artist": "Whitherward", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8724857.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.458799, 38.288606], "Date": "Sat Dec 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-07", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Americana, Blues, Indie Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "HopMonk Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "It all started with a question: \u201cWhat if we formed a duo?\u201d\n\nSongwriters Ashley E. Norton and Edward A. Williams had been through a number of musical endeavours individually - including duos - and the prospect of a new project sounded intriguing. As details were hashed out, the core principles became readily evident: have fun and tour often. With a large stable of strong self and co-written songs and a prominent mission statement, Ash and Ed were ready to embark on a new journey. All that was needed was a name.\n\nAgain, a question: \u201cHow about \u2018whitherward\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe name took quickly, gaining a life of its own; within days, a website was created, local shows were booked, recordings were done, and a small tour was constructed. It was exciting and validating; a musical project where the sky was the limit, and no challenge seemed insurmountable.\n\nThen, after surveying the current outlook of their career, a new question arose: \u201cWhat if we toured full-time?\u201d\n\nIt would mean a lot of sacrifice - regular work schedules would be scuttled, permanent housing foregone, and material possessions reduced to a minimum. The performance requirements of sustaining a full-time tour would be grueling, and the workload more than doubles when considering the financial commitment required of being on the road indefinitely.\n\nBut amongst all the new responsibilities and stresses, there\u2019s an inherent mystery about the open road - from a typical human vantage, it\u2019s impossible to see what is around the next bend, over the next hill. In an ironic twist, this provides a startling clarity about life and how it can be lived - as so many people profess - day by day. When you can only see as far as the next hill, it somehow manages to decrease the amount of worry about what\u2019s on the other side. Rather, it helps to build a sense of wonder for what\u2019s over there, and you want to keep pushing to see it for yourself.\n\nThe duo now has four self-produced, self-published EPs full of intricate, thoughtful music, putting the emotions of life on the road and outside of the box on display. A full length album is in the works. New collaborations with bassist Patrick Hershey and violinist Stephanie Groot on both the 4th EP and the upcoming full-length album expand the sonic landscape of the duo\u2019s efforts. In addition to playing over 200 shows a year, their travels enable them to reach a number of diehard fans, new destinations, and old friends that serve to grow an ever-expanding audience.\n\nWhitherward is an Old English adverb that means \u201cin which direction\u201d. The word seems to invite an eternal question; it feels like the perfect fit for a duo that constantly seeks to reinvent itself in every aspect of its existence, always looking for the next impossible question to answer.

They began with a simple goal: to play and help revive American roots music.\n\nAsleep at the Wheel landed a gig opening for Alice Cooper and Hot Tuna in Washington, DC in 1970. At the height of Vietnam, many Americans were using their choice of music to express their stance on the conflict in southeast Asia. \u201cWe wanted to break that mold,\u201d said Benson. \u201cWe were concerned more with this amazing roots music, which we felt was being lost amid the politics. We were too country for the rock folks and we were too long-haired for the country folks. But everybody got over it once the music started playing.\u201d\n\nA year later, they were coaxed into moving to California by Commander Cody, leader of Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen.

The alumni roster is well over 80+ members, and includes an impressive list of musicians who have gone on to perform with artists such as Bob Dylan, George Strait, Van Morrison, Lyle Lovett, Ryan Adams, and many more. A quick scan of awards, such as \u201cTouring Band of the Year\u201d (CMAs, 1976) and \u201cLifetime Achievement in Performance\u201d (Americana Music Awards 2009), not to mention near dominance of the GRAMMY \u201cCountry Instrumental\u201d category over the years, reflects the reputation of the band\u2019s musicianship.

This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint. She continues to tour and record as well as remaining a strong presence in her community, working with local youth as a vocal coach and mentor. She encourages them to follow their dreams to sing freely and wholeheartedly. -Written by Elle K. Productions 9x award-winning R&B/Soul music artist.

With the help of producer Alex Wong (Vienna Teng, Delta Rae, Amber Rubarth), Megan and her band are creating an edgy, spirited rock record, full of raw, sometimes sassy, often dark emotion: the sunny, exuberant singer-songwriter\u2019s new album is her Dorian Gray picture from the attic. The album, entitled Running on Machinery, is available now.\n\n\n\nAlso this year, Megan created inDIYe, a new comedic talk and sketch webshow that provides a light-hearted \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d look at what it\u2019s really like to be an indie musician. (See below for link.) The show features musicians and others in the music biz from all over, many from the SF Bay Area; in the first episode, Canadian singer-songwriter Steve Poltz, known among other things for his collaborations with Jewel, was a guest star.\n\n\n\nMegan has already sold over 35,000 copies of her four previous independently released CDs. Her last CD, A Token Of The Wreckage, is \"an edgy alt-rock release that is a breath of fresh air\" (Maverick Magazine), \u201cgleaming, grooving, and gritty\u201d (Minor 7th), with \"thoughtful construction and clever wordplay\" (Performer Magazine). That release, which was recorded with help from David Bryson (Counting Crows) and Jerry Becker (Train), held a spot in the 10 Best-Selling Albums on CD Baby for weeks. Her songs have also won several awards: in 2013 alone, she was a finalist in the UK Songwriting Contest, a finalist in the International Songwriting Contest (ISC), and a finalist in the Show Me the Music Contest. She was also a finalist for Best Female Artist in the International Acoustic Music Awards (IAMA).\n\n\n\nTouring does not take a back seat to Megan\u2019s love of writing, recording, and performing. She has toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe\u2013tens of thousands of miles\u2013having performed in every U.S. state but seven. She gathered many adventures along the way, as indie artists do: rental cars breaking down in the wee hours in a rough neighborhood in Atlanta, being surrounded by a gang in a parking lot in Denver after a show, lost luggage and a trip to WalMart for performance essentials. On better days, she opened for Jamie Cullum at a sold-out Fillmore, played electric guitar on ABC\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel Live as part of the Jeff Campbell Band, belted the National Anthem to a crowd of 45,000 Giants baseball fans, sang duets with Pat Monahan of Train, and toured with Dire Straits co-founder David Knopfler\u2013even co-writing the title track to his album Ship of Dreams.\n\n\n\nOther adventures include singing the part of Mia in the new Google/Bill Keane (Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast) short film \u201cDuet\u201d and singing for a Nature Valley commercial. She even dabbled in musical theatre, playing a dizzy blonde in one of San Francisco\u2019s own Thunderbird Theatre Co. productions. And last, but not in the least bit least, she appeared in TLC\u2019s fashion makeover reality show What Not to Wear. Twice.

Not long after Ryan began learning how to play guitar, he joined a local rock band as the lead guitar player and entered various local battle of the bands contests. The first band he ever played in was \"Referral\". They entered into a contest a local classic rock radio station hosted by the famous Greg Kihn was putting on called The Last Band Standing. Ryan and his band ended up winning the contest in the 18/under category and got to play 5-6 songs live on air with Greg Kihn on his morning show. \"It felt surreal at only 14 yrs old being able to play live on the air with Greg Kihn for an audience of around a million people. It couldn't have been a better experience for me and the band\", Ryan recalls. At 16 years old, Ryan really began to find a love and passion for country music. \"I have some family who loved country music and it really just grew on me over time the more I was around it. You would think I would get sick of it from constantly hearing my family listening to it but it actually just made me love this genre of music even more.\" It wasn't until around the age of 18 years old that Ryan began to develop himself as a vocalist. \"I would bring my guitar to play at a friends bonfire and while I loved to play the guitar all night, I felt like there was something missing. I really wanted to start singing,\" Ryan recalls. At that point, Ryan had a grown passion for country music and began uploading videos to YouTube of himself singing and playing popular country songs. As Ryan began to progress and get better he wanted to take things to the next level and that was starting a country band. Now at the age of 23, Ryan has been playing regularly at various country bars across Northern California along with his band and strong female vocalist, Cece Bamburg. About one year ago, Ryan released his first EP to iTunes and Spotify titled as \"Ryan 'n' Cece\". The three song EP includes two originals written by Ryan and one cover song which were all produced by Ben Araiza of Def Moose Studios based out of San Jose, CA.

As a DJ, producer and mogul whose label is at the forefront of modern electronic dance music, it goes without saying that Nicky is a force to be reckoned with. From the iconic hits \"Toulouse\" and \"I Could Be the One\" to his recent #1 US Dance Radio track \u2018Sometimes\u2019 with DallasK & Xylo in 2019. Nicky's resume boasts an impressive and lengthy discography of originals, remixes, edits and co-productions, proving again and again his ability to evolve with the ever-changing landscape of electronic music. Perhaps even more telling of his razor-sharp prowess and visionary mindset is the success and impact of his label Protocol Recordings, setting up recent collaborations with David Guetta, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.\n\nIn the late 2000's, EDM was having its heyday, and Nicky Romero was at the forefront of the movement that would become one of the most significant cultural resurgences in decades. After releasing several singles early in his career, Nicky officially had his breakthrough moments with the viral anthem \"Toulouse\" and \"I Could Be the One\" (vs. Avicii), which to date has amassed over 185 million streams on Spotify alone.

Some years later, on a road trip up the coast of California to Oregon, on the Pacific Coast Highway, they were inspired to write their first song together, which led to the formation of the band. In the fall of 2009 they recorded their independently produced, 5-song debut EP at Amadeo Studios in the Bay Area.\n\n\n\nShortly after moving to Los Angeles in 2008, they began writing and performing music together (under the name Ampersand, later transitioning to The Singer and The Songwriter). The duo started out crafting simple folk songs, but as their songwriting developed, they began to incorporate influences from different eras of jazz and pop music, which led to the creation of their unique, vibrant, \u201csophisticated but playful\u201d sound (BuzzBands LA). Their music is a stylistic hybrid, reflecting their diverse musical and cultural backgrounds. \u201cHis guitar shimmies and swings like Django Reinhardt while her voice wraps around each note, swaying in unison like a modern-day Ella Fitzgerald.\u201d (Nooga).\n\n\n\nRachel Garcia grew up listening to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Elvis and Michael Jackson. At a young age, her love of music was nurtured by performing in choirs. Her rich and nuanced vocal style draws inspiration from female vocalists old (Ella Fitzgerald, June Christy, Mama Cass) and new (Fiona Apple, Laura Mvula, Melody Gardot, and Cecile McLorin Salvant).\n\n\n\nThu Tran\u2019s songwriting merges traditional styles with modern pop sensibilities. He draws inspiration from the Bossa Nova sounds of Antonio Carlos Jobim, the swinging jazz guitar of Django Reinhardt, and the lyricism of modern songwriters like Sufjan Stevens and Rufus Wainwright.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, the duo won the West Coast Songwriters International Song Contest in the Miscellaneous category for their recording of The Art of Missing You \u2013 \u201c\u2026a delightfully poised and melancholic classic jazz ballad that Sarah Vaughan or Billie Holiday would have gladly wrapped their wounded souls around.\u201d (Americana UK)\n\n\n\nIn 2014, The Singer and The Songwriter released their critically acclaimed, debut full-length LP, What a Difference a Melody Makes, produced by Charlie Stavish (Ryan Adams, Jenny Lewis) with mixing and mastering by Brooklyn collective, Mason Jar Music (Lucius, Feist and Andrew Bird). Debuting at #34 on the CMJ Jazz Top 40 Charts, the album has been critically praised as \u201cdiverse, confident, stylish and accomplished\u201d (Americana-UK), \u201ca revelation\u201d (Pittsburgh In Tune) and \u201can opus worthy of national attention\u201d (Playback: STL).\n\n\n\nIn March 2016, The Singer and The Songwriter released their sophomore EP, Ballads for Trying Times, produced by Griffin Rodriguez (Beirut). This latest release is being praised as \u201ca delectable listen, an emotional journey down a sullen, yet hopeful trail. Garcia and Tran bring together songs that appear written just for the listener, and no one else.\u201d (Playback: STL). The songs on the EP are described as \u201cbaroque lullabies that move along with an ease and fluidity that showcases their musical maturity and sensibility.\u201d (The Deli LA) and provide \u201c smart commentary on social attitudes\u201d (Pasadena Weekly) \u201cGarcia's rich, warm voice wraps around you like the softest quilt and Tran's subdued guitar shines at all the right moments, creating somber tracks that are more than palatable and neccessary.\u201d (Bitch Media)\n\n\n\nThe duo are currently on a national US tour. Of their live show, The Eastsider LA writes: \u201cTran\u2019s [\u2026] colorful playing style paired wonderfully with the dramatic and soulful voice of his partner in crime. It was clear that underneath Garcia\u2019s cafe-jazz voice lay a rich, billowing and powerful vocal onslaught.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "390 Morris St, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Amy Obenski", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9124552.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.819974, 38.408317], "Date": "Sun Dec 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-08", "Genre": "Genres: Ethereal Downtempo Folk-Rock, Acoustic, Singer, Songwriter, Experimental, Rock, Pop, Folk Rock", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Sebastopol Community Cultural Center", "moreBioInfo": "Amy's songs are timeless.

This year, he has reassembled the core band from the Year of the Cat album \u2014 including occasional Pink Floyd collaborator Tim Renwick and smooth jazz superstar Peter White \u2014 and enlisted their musical prowess in support of his latest release, Spinoza\u2019s Dream.\n\nNachmanoff is uniquely positioned to undertake a concept album project like Spinoza\u2019s Dream; not only has he been Stewart\u2019s musical co-collaborator for the better part of a decade and a half, he also holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of California. So maybe the \u201csinger-songwriter\u201d tag deserves to be retired in favor of \u201csinger-philosopher,\u201d which would place him more rightly among the likes of Randy Newman, Warren Zevon, Kris Kristofferson, and other performers whose musical output has been guided by a creative vision that extends far beyond \u201cmoon-June-spoon\u201d lyrics and \u201cG-D-C-Am\u201d chord progressions.\n\nGrowing up in the shadow of the nation\u2019s capital, Nachmanoff cut his musical teeth on Pete Seeger, country rock, the Kingston Trio\u2019s early revival folk, and \u201880s new wave, all melded with a soup\u00e7on of Brit folk a la Fairport Convention, John Martyn, and Ralph McTell. In fact, Spinoza\u2019s Dream producer Martin Levan had a guiding hand in both Martyn\u2019s Grace and Danger and McTell\u2019s Water of Dreams, two critically-acclaimed classics of the genre.\n\nOver the course of a dozen albums and countless tours, he has shared the stage with the likes of Alison Krauss, Cheryl Wheeler, Steve Forbert, Firefall, and John Wesley Harding (among many others), at venues ranging from The Bottom Line to the Glastonbury Festival. He\u2019s also paid his dues in myriad classrooms across the United States, sharing his talents and nurturing the next generation of budding troubadours.\n\nSingOut! has praised his \u201cheartfelt, inspired songwriting \u2026 with a delivery both biting and assured,\u201d but that\u2019s only the tip of the Nachmanoff critical iceberg. Just Plain Folks honored him with the 2001 Songwriter of the Year award, he was a finalist in the 2011 USA Songwriting Competition, and for five consecutive years he was always in the mix for the top songwriting award in the South Florida Folk Festival before finally winning Best Overall in 2002.\n\nNachmanoff currently resides in Northern California, not far from the heritage vines that helped inspire his 2009 collaboration with Al Stewart, Uncorked. Perhaps the most important trait he shares with his local agricultural cousins is that his songs, much like a fine wine, gain complexity and substance over time.\n\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n\nSpinoza\u2019s Dream (Troubador Records, 2016)\nStep Up (Troubador Records, 2011)\nTime Before the Fall (Troubador Records, 2006)\nWordless Rhymes (Troubador Records, 2005)\nThreads of Time (Troubador Records, 2004)\nAnother Big Day (Naked Goose Records, 2002)\nHoly Smokes!

And yet, until just two short years ago, McBean had lived his entire adolescence and adult life without a proper driver\u2019s license, that first and most coveted ticket to personal independence. When he did finally take the wheel in 2017, he essentially became a Sixteen Year Old for the first time, blowing out the doors off the DMV like a pyrotechnics display at a W.A.S.P. gig. Black Mountain\u2019s new album, Destroyer, named after the discontinued single-run 1985 Dodge Destroyer muscle car, is imbued with all that wild-ass freedom and newfound agency (and anxiety and fear) that comes with one's first time behind the wheel. McBean, welding mask pulled over his Alan Watts beard, has even been rebuilding a 1985 Destroyer in his step-dad\u2019s garage all spring \u2014 building it from its frame, putting in weekends of work to have this beast ready for sunnier days. And wouldn\u2019t you know it: when the Destoyer's engine gives its deep snarl and the stereo rattles with Metallica's $5.98 EP, McBean is fully in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nDestroyer is structured around that first time behind the wheel of a hot rod. The fat, charging \u201cLiving After Midnight\u201d riffs of opener \u201cFuture Shade\u201d is, according to McBean, \u201cStraight outta the gates. FM radio cranked.\u201d He ain\u2019t kidding. The song, and all of Destroyer for that matter, seems to exist at that crucial nexus of the early-to-mid 80s Los Angeles when a war between punk and hair metal was waged. Black Flag\u2019s My War tried and failed to keep the peace. But in the trenches, some hybrid ghoul was beginning to form in bands like Jane\u2019s Addiction and White Zombie. The heavy extended player \u201cHorns Arising,\u201d with its Night Rider vocals and golden, climbing Blade Runner synths, is a fill-up at a desert gas station just in time to see a UFO hovering near a mesa. . And other songs, like The serpentine \u201cBoogie Lover\u201d is a cruise down the Sunset Strip. You pull into The Rainbow Bar & Grill to take the edge off. Doesn\u2019t matter what year it is, Lemmy\u2019s there in flesh or spirit. To continue the teenage theme, there\u2019s also a sense of to these cuts \u2014 \u201cHigh Rise\u201d is a foray into Japanese psych, rounding the bend to a careening, youthful sense of discovery, while \u201cCloser to the Edge\u201d feeling like falling in love with Yes (Remember how good they were for a minute there in your youth?). \u201cLicensed to Drive\u201d would easily be the most exhilarating and dangerous ripper on a titular film\u2019s soundtrack, a dose of heavy right before the muscle car\u2019s wheels fly off going 100 mph on the freeway.\n\nShacked up in his rehearsal space, McBean found an old chair in an alley, spray painted Producer on the back and pressed record. Friends from the endless rock\u2019n\u2019roll highway were invited over and 22 songs were brought to life. And while some were laid back into shallow graves to dig up once again at a later date, the remaining skeletons were left above ground \u2014 given organs, skin, eyes, and the opportunity to grow their hair real long and greasy. Some of these zombie hesher jams were sent on a journey to Canada where longtime band member Jeremy Schmidt, slipping on the Official Collaborator satin jacket, had at them with his legendary synth arsenal. As he added long flowing robes, sunglasses, driving gloves and medallions, the undead songs began to transform into the new breathing creatures that make up Destroyer. Schmidt\u2019s work with these songs was the needed transformative glue for this new era of Black Mountain.\n\nComing off his newfound automotive freedom, McBean also saw some personnel shuffling within Black Mountain. Both Joshua Wells and Amber Webber have retired their Black Mountain Army uniforms while Arjan Miranda paid his outstanding membership dues and rejoined. New members include Rachel Fannan (Sleepy Sun) and Adam Bulgasem (Dommengang & Soft Kill) plus other familiar names like Kliph Scurlock (Flaming Lips), Kid Millions (Oneida), and John Congleton (St Vincent, Swans) take a turn in the shotgun seat.

In just a few short years, the group\u2014Wilbur, fellow horn player Wenzl McGowen, and drummer James Muschler\u2014has gone from playing on New York City subway platforms to touring with the likes of Beats Antique, They Might Be Giants, and Lotus, as well as selling out their own headline shows in major venues around the country. On \u2018Red Sky,\u2019 their third and most adventurous album to date, the band uses everything they\u2019ve learned from their whirlwind journey to push their sound to new heights, bringing together the raw, transcendent energy of their live performances and the sleek sophistication of their studio work into a singular, intoxicating brew that blends elements of virtuosic jazz, groovy funk, and pulse-pounding electronic dance music.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think \u2018Red Sky\u2019 is more focused than any of our past albums,\u201d reflects McGowen. \u201cWe practice meditation and yoga, and I think that we\u2019re more evolved as people than we\u2019ve ever been right now. That evolution expresses itself as focus, and through focus comes our energy.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was two years ago that the band released \u2018This Is Cave Music,\u2019 an exhilarating thrill ride that earned rave reviews from critics and fans alike. NPR hailed it as \u201cunhinged\u201d and \u201cirresistible,\u201d praising each musician\u2019s \u201cremarkable abilities\u201d and naming their Tiny Desk Concert one of the best in the prestigious series\u2019 history. The album followed their 2013 debut, which had Relix swooning for their \u201cdeep bass lines, catchy melodies and pounding rhythms,\u201d while the Wall Street Journal celebrated their \u201celectronic house music mixed with brawny saxophone riffs.\u201d Though the band\u2014whose members initially met as students at the New School\u2014turned heads in the music industry as relative unknowns with a charismatic, unconventional sound (they play with unique tonguing techniques and utilize found objects like traffic cones attached to the bells of their horns to manipulate tone, for instance), they were already a familiar and beloved sight to straphangers in New York, who would react with such joy and fervor to their impromptu subway platform sets that the NYPD had to ban them from locations that couldn\u2019t handle the crowds. NY Mag once referred to their sound as \u201cJay Gatsby on ecstasy,\u201d while the NY Post fell for their \u201ccatchy melodic hooks and funky rhythms,\u201d saying they had \u201cthe power to make you secretly wish that the short [subway] wait becomes an indefinite delay.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile the band\u2019s busking days are behind them now, the lessons they learned from all those platform parties helped guide their approach to recording \u2018Red Sky.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we discovered playing in the subway,\u201d McGowen explains, \u201cis that the more focus and the more energy you put into the music, and the more you listen to everything around you and integrate everything around you into your expression, the more the music becomes this captivating force for people.\u201d\n\n\n\nRecorded at The Bunker studio in Brooklyn, \u2018Red Sky\u2019 is nothing if not captivating. The album opens with the tribal urgency of the title track and proceeds, over the next 45 minutes, to utterly demolish any and every possible barrier that could stand between your ass and the dance floor. On \u2018Shot,\u2019 Wilbur sings a stream of consciousness vocal line over an airtight groove, while \u201cPsychotubes\u201d channels the apocalyptic fire and brimstone of death metal, and the staccato intro of \u201cThat\u2019s What They Say\u201d gives way to a gritty, late-night come-on of a saxophone line that\u2019s far more suggestive than any whispered words ever could be.\n\n\n\nThough the band is heavily inspired by electronic music, they made a conscious effort to use as little in the way of \u201cstudio tricks\u201d as possible on \u2018Red Sky,\u2019 aiming instead to capture the sound of their live show, which has evolved significantly from their days underground.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we were playing in the subways, we were playing entirely acoustic,\u201d explains Wilbur. \u201cIt was just two saxes and a drum set. Then Wenzl acquired a baritone sax and we all started getting into music production and incorporating electronic music into our live shows.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt their performances, the band now plays through what they call a Reverse DJ setup, in which the live sound from their horns runs through Ableton software on their laptops to process recorded effects onto the output. In addition, to flesh out their sound on the road, the band began utilizing Moog synthesizers, an EWI (an electronic wind instrument that responds to breath in addition to touch), and other more traditional instruments like clarinets. Wilbur added vocals to his repertoire on some tracks (something the subway never allowed him to do), and Muschler, meanwhile, traveled halfway around the world to expand his percussion skills.\n\n\n\n\u201cI went to India, and the first morning I woke up, it was like 5am, and I followed this music along the banks of the Ganges,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI eventually ended up finding this amazing tabla player, and after his performance, I asked him for lessons. He agreed, and I went for daily lessons with him and another guy for the next two weeks. After that, I took a train to Calcutta, where I met with the guru that I\u2019d studied with in New York, and I did morning lessons with him and practiced throughout the day. It was an incredible musical immersion experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe band members all speak reverently of meditation and consciousness and the role it plays in their music (McGowen believes his introduction to it, spurred on in part by Wilbur and Muschler, saved his life), but equally close to their hearts are the environmental causes they champion. Moon Hooch tries to live up to their green ideals while traveling as much as possible, playing benefit shows, supporting local farmers and co-ops, participating in river cleanups, filming informative videos for their fans, and more. The band even runs a food blog, Cooking In The Cave, in which they highlight the healthy, sustainable, organic recipes they utilize with their mobile kitchen setup on tour.\n\n\n\nFor the members of Moon Hooch, commitments to consciousness and environmentalism and veganism and philosophy and peace aren\u2019t separate from their commitment to music, but actually integral parts of it. It\u2019s all tied into that same core approach that led to their discovery on the subway platform: try, even if it\u2019s just a little bit every day, even if it\u2019s just with the power of your mind, to make the world less like it is and more like you wish it could be.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say all of our songs express the essence of that kind of energy,\u201d concludes McGowen, \u201cbecause before you can even think any thoughts, there exists the energy that drives those thoughts, and that energy is intention. I feel like we\u2019re putting the intention of positive change constantly into our music. While we\u2019re playing, I often see the future emerging: skyscrapers getting covered in plants, frowns turning into smiles, fistfights into hugs. I can see the energy of love and collaboration and trust replace the energy of fear, hatred and violence.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious vision, to be sure, but considering the band\u2019s track record at turning their thoughts and dreams into action and reality, perhaps it\u2019s only a matter of time.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1111 California St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "iHeartRadio Jingle Ball", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616849.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412938, 37.791183], "Date": "Sun Dec 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Masonic", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 6:30pm To gain access to the Capital One\u00ae Cardholder Presale, enter the first 6 digits of your eligible Capital One\u00ae Visa or Mastercard card number (no spaces or dashes) as your offer code.

The Californian trio has dedicated itself to mastery of the mind-bending jam session, evoking the spirits of Jimi Hendrix and Black Sabbath in equal measure. Named after a song title from vintage New York garage-psych band The Druids of Stonehenge, EARTHLESS' sound has been called \"A sonic kaleidoscope of lava and lightning\", earning it the title of \"California's loudest band\". The group delivers \"one of the best live shows in all of modern, heavy rock,\" leading to one reviewer stating that the band's \"epic shredding harkens back to the days were psychedelic rock had balls the size of grapefruits and wasn't afraid to take its listeners on a ride for which they may never return.\" Each member of EARTHLESS has done time in many other bands. Drummer (and former pro skater) Mario Rubalcaba currently plays in the hardcore punk band OFF! and has also occupied the drum throne in Rocket From The Crypt and Hot Snakes amongst many others. Bassist Mike Eginton played with Electric Nazarene and guitarist Isaiah Mitchell was most recently in Howlin' Rain, has played with Nebula and Drunk Horse and also heads up the Bay Area band Golden Void. In the end, EARTHLESS is the musical rock that grounds the three musicians and now, after more than half a decade since the release of their last studio LP, EARTHLESS has returned and is out to prove -- through sheer rock power -- why they are considered the cream of the modern day heavy psych scene. EARTHLESS' 4th studio album, \"Black Heaven\", was recorded with Dave Catching (Eagles of Death Metal) at Rancho de la Luna in August 2017 and will be released March 18, 2018 on Nuclear Blast.

His solo debut album, F'Real, was released on Veritech in 1997.\n\nAlongside Slug, Murs has been part of the group Felt since 2002. The End of the Beginning, his debut album on Definitive Jux, was released in 2003. Murs released Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition, an album entirely produced by 9th Wonder, in 2004. Taking a more thoughtful approach than gangster rappers, it prompted Andy Gill of The Independent to say \"eschewing bogus glamour for emotional realism, Murs manages to say more about the corrosive cancer of hip-hop's gun culture than all the thousands of column inches lavished on 50 Cent's bullet wounds\". After another collaborative album with 9th Wonder, Murray's Revenge, in 2006, Murs signed a contract with Warner Bros., his debut album for the label being Murs for President. It was preceded by Sweet Lord which was given away free to fans.\n\nMurs released Varsity Blues 2, a follow-up to his Varsity Blues EP, with production duties handled by Aesop Rock, Terrace Martin and Droop-E in 2011. He released This Generation, a collaborative album with Fashawn, in 2012.\n\nMurs was invited by Sacha Jenkins, a hip hop journalist, to join the group The White Mandingos, a collaboration between Jenkins and Bad Brains bassist Daryl Jenifer. They released their first album, The Ghetto is Tryna Kill Me, on June 11, 2013 under the Fat Beats record label. Murs has stated that the recording is a loose concept album about a man from the hood who struggles to maintain his identity while recording as a rock artist. The band members have acknowledged that the album is partially based on their own experiences.\n\nOn February 7, 2014, it was announced via Tech N9ne's Facebook page that Murs was signed to his record label Strange Music. Later that year, Murs teamed up with fellow Strange Music members Mayday! to drop the !Mursday\u00a1 album as his first release on the label.

What started off as a house party and bedroom dj project has now escalated to one of the best known djs around. He has played everywhere with a sound system and always brings the party. He's shared the stage with the likes of J.Phlip, Brenmar, Christian Martin, Eliot Lipp, Ardalan, Ana Sia, Michael Menert, Fort Knox 5, Dj Abilities, and every local in between. With a wide library and vast knowledge of music varying from jackin house to old school breaks to bass driven electronica to O-face hip-hop he plays what makes the feet hop and booties drop. Often describing his music as \"all about sex,\" bring your towel and gold bond, because it's gonna get sweaty.... But it aint just about dj'ing. BK's been well known for his abilities to throw parties like no one's business. It's been an infatuation since a child, to provide all aspects, all sides, all factors needed to form nights that no one soon forgets. Including party planning, booking, graphic design, and promotion. With annual nights beginning with BK Value Meal at The Summit and College Night at The Starlight that then soon escalated to larger theme nights. With plenty of solo promoted parties within his distant history. He later helped create and form local party powerhouse crew Mountain Mayhem, it's aim to build, bring, and host a major sound camp at Burning Man and beyond. With a couple years under their belt now, and parties within town such as Boomtown, Moustache Ride, Pajamma Jammy Jam, Walk of Shame, and two years of Burning Man, they've proved they take having fun Seriously, and have only just begun. Recently branching out and hosting nights with much larger, well known international talent and plans to move to San Francisco in August, we can only sit on the edge of our seat to see what's in this young man's future.

His contributions to iconic music, music education, and the gear that drummers use, are many. Modern Drummer magazine has inducted Weckl into their Hall of Fame (2000) and named him \"one of the 25 best drummers of all time.\"\n\nThese honors, in addition to many more bestowed by the music community, are the product of Weckl's commitment to excellence. His dynamic and diverse drumming, which has inspired musicians worldwide, is built on a foundation of knowledge and passion.\n\nWeckl was born in St. Louis Missouri, January 8th, 1960. Though his parents were not professional musicians, his mother loved music and his father played the piano as a hobby. Weckl started drums at the age of 8, playing along to records in a spare room. He eventually moved his kit into the living room where he sometimes accompanied his father who played piano.\n\nEarly on, Weckl practiced to rock records by the Monkees, Credence Clearwater Revival, and more. Rock drumming came easily and his interest quickly turned to Buddy Rich, Louie Bellson, Philly Joe Jones, and Steve Gadd, to name a few. In his early teens, Weckl's passion for jazz and big band drumming reallly blossomed.\n\nDuring his high school years, Weckl received many awards from the NAJE (National Association of Jazz Educators) for outstanding performances in his high school's competition-winning jazz band. He also became involved with numerous local groups starting at the age of 16 while studying with St. Louis-area teachers Bob Matheny and Joe Buerger.\n\n1979 saw a move to the East coast and the University of Bridgeport. While playing the New York club scene with a band called Nite Sprite, Weckl started receiving accolades from established studio musicians such as Steve Kahn, Michael Brecker, and Peter Erskine. It was Erskine who recommended Weckl for his first 'big gig' with a group called French Toast, forerunner to the Michel Camilo band. That band featured iconic electric bass player Anthony Jackson.\n\nFrom this group, Jackson recommended Weckl for the prestigious 1983 Simon and Garfunkel reunion tour. This got Weckl noticed by a much larger industry audience and lead to many session opportunities, including radio and TV jingles, sound track sessions, and top recording dates with George Benson, Peabo Bryson, Diana Ross, Robert Plant, and many more.\n\nIn 1985, Michael Brecker recommended Weckl to Chick Corea for his new Elektric Band. That was the beginning of a seven-year relationship with both the Elektric and Akoustic bands where nine recordings and three videos were produced. The Akoustic Band release earned Weckl a Grammy.\n\nThe Elektric Band showcased Weckl's cutting-edge drumming and innovative use of electronic and acoustic drums, bringing him worldwide recognition. Though the Elektric Band went on a 10-year hiatus in the early '90s, the band still tours from time-to-time. They released a 17-part conceptual album entitled To The Stars in mid-2004, and have reunited for tours in 2011 and 2016/17.\n\nWeckl's solo career began in 1990 with the release of Master Plan. Co-written/produced with longtime St. Louis friend/colleague Jay Oliver, the album was a watershed moment in Weckl's career. Some would say it ushered in a new generation of contemporary drumming.\n\nMaster Plan featured a dynamic and diverse collection of tracks featuring top jazz artists of the time. The album created a palette for Weckl's wide-ranging abilities in jazz, fusion, and Latin-inspired music, solidifying him as an emerging leader in the drumming world.\n\nThe album's title track, written and performed by Chick Corea, featured Weckl and Steve Gadd on drums. Weckl had been seen as a protege to Gadd and their styles meshed perfectly on the track. But in many ways, the tune marked a \"passing of the torch\" in terms of next-generation artistry on the drums.\n\nWeckl has recorded and produced nine other solo/leader recordings to date. In addition to Master Plan, Heads Up and Hard-Wired earned him great notoriety in the early '90s.\n\nIn 1998, Weckl realized his long-time goal of forming a world-touring band. The Dave Weckl Band released five studio records, including: Rhythm Of The Soul, Synergy, Transition, Perpetual Motion, and Multiplicity. The band also released a hot live album, LIVE (And Very Plugged In) plus a compilation of DWB and instructional videos entitled The Zone.\n\nInstructional videos have always played a big role in Weckl's career. His original product, entitled Contemporary Drummer + 1, was one of the first play-along products ever published for drums. His Back To Basics and The Next Step releases were best-sellers in the '90s and also continue to sell today.\n\nWeckl updated his technical approach in the '90s after studying with Freddie Gruber. He then released a three-part series of videos called A Natural Evolution, which included an appearance by Gruber. These products redefined earlier concepts to help drummers understand how to play in a relaxed, efficient, and musical way. They also helped solidified Weckl's stature as an articulate and respected teacher. His clinics and master classes continue to attract capacity crowds worldwide.\n\nAfter many years of sideman work with guitar legend Mike Stern, Chris Minh Doky's Nomads, Oz Noy, and more, Weckl spent 2013 reuniting with Jay Oliver. They launched a crowd funding campaign that attracted more than 2,000 pre-orders of a project that would eventually be called Convergence.\n\nThe album featured 10 tunes, including piano and drum solo pieces and a remake of Stevie Wonder's legendary tune \"Higher Ground.\" The video of \"Higher Ground\" has been viewed millions of times on YouTube and Facebook. Drummer Chris Coleman, bassist Jimmie Johnson, guitarist Dean Brown, singer Chrissi Poland, and several amazing horn players and vocalists took part.\n\nThe project also saw collaborations with Canadian singer Emilie-Claire Barlow and Riverdance creator Bill Whelan. Oliver recorded several native Irish instruments at Whelan's personal studio in Ireland.\n\nConvergence was released with three companion products: a play-along package for drums, a play-along package for all other instruments on the album, and a full-length documentary entitled Flies On The Studio Wall.\n\nIn 2015, Weckl formed an acoustic jazz group with longtime friend/collaborator Tom Kennedy (bass), Gary Meek (sax), and Makoto Ozone (piano/B3). The group was called The Dave Weckl Acoustic Band. To date, the band has released a CD entitled Of The Same Mind and a live DVD filmed at Catalina Jazz Club in Hollywood.\n\nMore recently, Weckl has returned to touring with the Elektric Band, Mike Stern, and Oz Noy, while completing sessions in his Los Angeles-area home studio. He has also formed an online school with comprehensive lessons, new play along products, and live footage from current tours.\n\nHe says \"it is my goal to inspire as many young (and not-so-young) people as possible to want to play music, whether it be on drums or another instrument. With all the negatives in the world today, I feel this is my way of contributing a positive action toward spiritual happiness, which music can be a big part of, if you let it. So parents, if your child has a talent for music, please allow them the opportunity to develop that\ntalent!\"\n\nOutside of music, Weckl has a passion for automobiles and racing. He and his Corvette ZO6 regularly post competitive times at race tracks around Southern California. Check out his YouTube racing channel!\n\nBeyond music and four-wheel indulgences, Dave's biggest passions and sources of inspiration come from his daughter, Claire, and his wife, Clivia.\n\nA future college graduate (psychology), Claire definitely has the music gene. She sang an amazing version of \"Cups (You're Gonna Miss Me)\" for the Convergence album. Her talent, passion, and work ethic make her father proud every day.\n\nDave's wife, Clivia (also formerly a singer) has a love and passion for music - and an amazing energy for everything life has to offer. She and Dave share time both in Italy and Los Angeles.", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Mike Stern, Jeff Lorber, Jimmy Haslip, Dave Weckl"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Jarina De Marco", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8681291.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Mon Dec 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-09", "Genre": "Genres: Death Metal, Pop, Folk, Metal", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Madame Gandhi, Jarina De Marco, & MILCK"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Madame Gandhi", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Mon Dec 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Madame Gandhi, Jarina De Marco, & MILCK"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "MILCK", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8473669.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Mon Dec 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-09", "Genre": "Genres: Pop Cinematic Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "I sing for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.

Growing up in the Washington, D.C. area, Stern revered all three of those guitar immortals, along with such potent blues guitarists as Albert and B.B. King. Aspects of those seminal influences can be heard in his playing on the 18 recordings he has released as a leader or in his acclaimed sideman work for Miles Davis, Billy Cobham, the Brecker Brothers, Jaco Pastorius, Steps Ahead, David Sanborn, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Joe Henderson and the all-star Four Generations of Miles band.\n\nStern\u2019s latest Concord Jazz release, Eleven, is an encounter with Grammy-winning keyboardist-composer-producer Jeff Lorber. Co-produced by bassist Jimmy Haslip, who had previously worked with the guitarist on the Yellowjacket\u2019s 2008 album, Lifecycle, this lively collaboration finds Stern at the peak of his powers, following on the heels of 2017\u2019s acclaimed Trip, his triumphant return to recording after a freak accident that threatened to end his career. The multiple Grammy-nominated guitarist was hailing a cab outside his apartment in Manhattan July 3, 2016 when he tripped over some hidden construction debris left in the street, fracturing both of his humerus bones (the long bones that run from the shoulder to the elbow) in the fall. Left with significant nerve damage in his right hand which prevented him from doing the simplest tasks, including holding a pick, Stern faced a series of surgeries and subsequent physical therapy before he could regain control of his nerve-damaged picking hand. And while Trip represented a strong comeback, the intrepid guitarist takes things up a notch on Eleven.\n\n\u201cWhen the idea was floated for this project, I asked a bunch of cats who worked with Jeff, like Randy Brecker, Dave Weckl and Bob Franceschini, and they all said, \u2018He\u2019s cool, he throws down, he can really get it going.\u2019 And they\u2019re right,\u201d said Stern. \u201cJeff\u2019s got a strong rhythmic groove and he comps really well on the Fender Rhodes, which is kind of his signature sound. And I feel like his music really comes more from soul music than smooth jazz. That Philly soul thing is definitely in some of his tunes on this record.\u201d\n\nAdded Lorber of their first collaboration together, \u201cMike\u2019s just a bebop wizard, he\u2019s got an incredible jazz feeling. And by the same token, he\u2019s got the rock and blues thing covered too. He\u2019s on both sides of the musical spectrum. So when I heard he was up for it, I was delighted to have a chance to work with him in the studio on this project. And I think we really hit it off musically as well as personally.\u201d\n\nOne of the top guitarists in jazz since his breakthrough days with Miles Davis' celebrated comeback band of the early 1980s, Stern has earned the respect of colleagues and critics alike while also exerting a towering influence on a generation of aspiring players. A guitarist of formidable technique, he continues to awe and inspire six-string aficionados with his seamless blend of bebop facility, scorching rock intensity and uncommon lyricism. As Jon Chappell of Guitar magazine noted, \u201cStern is not only a magician of the fretboard but a heartfelt and mature composer of great depth.\u201d By combining the legato approach of jazz saxophone greats like John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and Joe Henderson with a few touches from the rock camp (i.e., distortion and delay pedals along with some urgent string bending, courtesy of his boyhood blues heroes B.B. King and Buddy Guy), Stern has successfully fashioned a singular voice that comfortably occupies both rock and jazz worlds.\n\nBorn on January 10, 1953, he began playing guitar at age 12, emulating the likes of B.B. King, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. \u201cI liked the feel of the guitar and I got hooked on it,\u201d he recalled in an interview. \u201cBut I didn't really get serious about it until I went to Berklee in 1971.\u201d At the Berklee College of Music in Boston his focus shifted to jazz as he began an intensive period of woodshedding, immersing himself in records by Miles Davis, John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner and Bill Evans while studying with guitarists Mick Goodrick and Pat Metheny. During his stint at Berklee, he developed a keen appreciation for jazz guitar greats Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall, both of whom would exert a huge influence on his own playing. On a recommendation from Metheny, Stern landed a gig with Blood, Sweat & Tears in 1976 and remained with the band for two years, appearing on the BS&T albums More Than Ever and Brand New Day. That gig is also significant for introducing the guitarist to two musicians who would later figure prominently in his life \u2014 percussionist Don Alias and bassist Jaco Pastorius.\n\nFollowing his stint with BS&T, Stern returned to Boston and began studying privately with local jazz guru Charlie Banacos. In 1979, he joined Billy Cobham's powerhouse fusion band and two years later he joined Miles Davis' group, making his public debut with the band on June 27, 1981 at the Kix nightclub in Boston (a performance that was documented on the CBS live album, We Want Miles). Stern remained with Miles through 1983, also appearing on Man With The Horn and Star People). From 1983 to 1984, he toured in Jaco Pastorius' Word Of Mouth band and in 1985 returned to Miles for a second tour of duty that lasted close to a year.\n\nIn 1985, Stern made his recording debut as a leader with Neesh on the Japanese Trio label. A year later, he made his Stateside debut as a leader on Atlantic Records with Upside Downside, which featured such celebrated colleagues as alto saxophonist David Sanborn, tenor saxophonist Bob Berg, bassists Mark Egan, Jeff Andrews and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardist Mitch Forman and drummers Dave Weckl and Steve Jordan. In the summer of 1986, Stern took to the road with David Sanborn and later joined an electrified edition of Steps Ahead, which featured Mike Mainieri on midi vibes, Michael Brecker on the Electronic Wind Instrument (EWI), Darryl Jones on electric bass and Steve Smith on drums. That powerhouse fusion outfit was documented on Live in Tokyo 1986. Over the next two years, Stern was a member of Michael Brecker\u2019s potent quintet, appearing on the tenor titan\u2019s 1988 album, Don\u2019t Try This At Home.\n\nStern's second Atlantic album, 1988's Time In Place, continued the promise of his debut and featured Peter Erskine on drums, Jim Beard on keyboards, Jeff Andrews on bass, Don Alias on percussion and Don Grolnick on organ. He followed that success with 1989's Jigsaw, which was produced by fellow guitarist Steve Khan. Following the release of 1991\u2019s Odds or Evens, Stern joined a reunited Brecker Brothers Band in 1992 and became a key factor in the success of that popular group for the next two years. His decidedly jazzy 1993 Atlantic release, Standards (And Other Songs), led to Stern being named Best Jazz Guitarist Of The Year by the readers and critics of Guitar Playermagazine. He followed that success with two hard-hitting offerings in 1994's Is What It Is and 1996's Between The Lines, both of which received Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1997, Stern returned to a jazzier aesthetic with Give And Take, a looser, more spontaneous session featuring bassist John Patitucci, drummer Jack DeJohnette, percussionist Don Alias and special guests Michael Brecker and David Sanbom. On the strength of that superbly swinging effort, which included freewheeling covers of Sonny Rollins' \u201cOleo,\u201d John Coltrane's \u201cGiant Steps\u201d and Cole Porter's \u201cI Love You,\u201d along with a scintillating trio rendition of Jimi Hendrix's \u201cWho Knows,\u201d he was awarded the Orville W. Gibson Award for Best Jazz Guitarist.\n\nStern\u2019s ninth release on Atlantic, 1999\u2019s Play, was a six-string summit meeting with fellow guitarists John Scofield and Bill Frisell. He followed with 2001\u2019s Voices, his first album to employ singers (Arto Tuncboyaciyan, Elizabeth Kantomanou, Richard Bona) and 2004\u2019s These Times, which featured guest turns from banjo ace Bela Fleck and alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett. 2006\u2019s Who Let The Cats Out? featured a bevy of bassists in Meshell Ndegeocello, Anthony Jackson, Richard Bona and Victor Wooten along with drummers Kim Thompson and Dave Weckl and harmonica ace Gregoire Maret and the late, great trumpeter Roy Hargrove.\n\nAt the Festival International de Jazz de Montr\u00e9al in June 2007, Stern was honored with the Miles Davis Award, which was created to recognize internationally acclaimed jazz artists whose body of work has contributed significantly to the renewal of the genre. Stern was also the artist in residence at the festival that summer of 2007, joining the renowned Yellowjackets for some electrifying live performances. Their kinetic chemistry was later documented on the 2008 studio collaboration Lifecycle, which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album.\n\nThe following year saw the release of his Grammy-nominated Big Neighborhood, which found Stern with guitar heroes Eric Johnson and Steve Vai, trumpeter Randy Brecker and jamband godfathers Medeski, Martin & Wood on a few tracks.\n\nStern was presented with Guitar Player magazine\u2019s Certified Legend Award on January 21, 2012. In June of that year, he released All Over the Place, which featured a delegation of high-caliber electric and acoustic bass players, including Esperanza Spalding, Richard Bona, Victor Wooten, Anthony Jackson, Dave Holland, Tom Kennedy, Will Lee and Victor Bailey. On 2014\u2019s Eclectic, Stern went toe-to-toe with Texas guitar slinger Eric Johnson, cutting a wide stylistic swath on eleven originals while showcasing their mutual love of Jimi Hendrix on a cover of his slow blues classic, \u201cRed House.\u201d Recorded in three days at Johnson\u2019s studio in Austin, Electric was hailed as \u201ca dazzling outing from two formidable, well-matched guitar heroes\u201d by Jazz Times magazine.\n\nThe guitar great continued to play with peerless authority while flaunting prodigious chops on 2017\u2019s Trip and now exhibits that same impressive six-string prowess on Eleven.", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Mike Stern, Jeff Lorber, Jimmy Haslip, Dave Weckl"}, {"Address": "500 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Brendan Getzell", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.398131, 37.779293], "Date": "Mon Dec 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Hotel Utah Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Open Mic with Brendan Getzell at Hotel Utah: The Old West and indie music come together at the Hotel Utah Saloon, where a small stage, an antique bar, and a diversely stocked jukebox set the scene.

Rather than choosing her calling, her natural ability and innate passion for music made her music career unavoidable. Gayle Skidmore\u2019s latest album and coloring book, \u201cSleeping Bear,\u201d was nominated for Best Pop Album in the 2014 San Diego Music Awards. She also won Best Singer-Songwriter in the 2013 San Diego Music Awards, and her song \"Paper Box\" was featured on HBO's new show \"Looking.\"\n\nClassically trained on the piano from the age of 4, Gayle Skidmore also plays at least 20 other instruments, including the mountain dulcimer, banjo, folk harp and balalaika. Her attention to detail and involvement in every step of the creative process, from producing her records to doing the artwork for her albums, show that she is completely dedicated to her craft. In August 2013, Gayle released her second full-length album and coloring book, \"Sleeping Bear,\" on Raincoat Records. This followed her first 7\u201d vinyl release, \u201cZombie Heart,\u201d put out by her sponsor, Ninkasi Brewing Co. In 2014 her cover of \u201cLola\u201d by The Kinks, a collaboration with Brandon O\u2019Connell of Singing Serpent, was placed on a national commercial. and she was featured on Time Warner Cable\u2019s SoCal Beat.\n\nGayle Skidmore\u2019s love of whimsy, poetry and magic are evidenced by the sets she creates for her stages, which have included a curtain of origami cranes and a giant octopus holding a teacup. She has opened for the likes of Jason Mraz, Lisa Loeb, Sean and Sara Watkins of Nickel Creek, Sam Phillips, Grant-Lee Phillips, Coeur d\u2019Pirate, and many others. She has recorded with such artists as The Softlightes, Bushwalla, Jason Mraz and Tyrone Wells, and branched out into several genres including electronic swing, indie rock, and classical music. Germany\u2019s most prominent newspaper, the Seuddeutsche Zeitung, named her \u201cDie Schutzpatronin der Gartenzwerge,\u201d the Patron Saint of Garden Dwarves, in an interview promoting her tour of Europe, which Skidmore found delightful. She has also toured nationwide in the US, and in the UK, Asia and Europe, and was a Sunset Sessions artist in 2012.\n\nGayle Skidmore finds endless inspiration in the whirlwind of life. She has never experienced writer\u2019s block, and she is always experimenting with new formats. When she isn\u2019t busy learning a new instrument, singing, painting, or writing lyrics and melodies, she composes parts for her cellist and violinist. She enjoys baking cookies and making origami for her fans.", "otherInfo": "Gayle Skidmore Amsterdam, Netherlands\nhttps://gayleskidmore.bandcamp.com\n\nMinor Birds Oakland, CA Indie/Symphonic Rock/Apocalyptic Doom Folk/MINOR-CORE\nhttps://minorbirds.bandcamp.com\n\nMiss Valeri Lopez Los Angeles, CA Singer/Songwriter\nhttps://www.valerilopez.com\nMusic"}, {"Address": "1232 Grant Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "The Bachelors", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.406986, 37.798566], "Date": "Mon Dec 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-09", "Genre": "Genres: Decades, 60s", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "The Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Bachelors at The Saloon: Revered for its daily live blues performances, the Saloon also has the rugged distinction of having survived the 1906 earthquake and standing as the oldest bar in San Francisco (opened in 1861).

Rather than the all too common sophomore slump, Khemmis raised the stakes and blew everyone away with their rapidly progressing songwriting and production quality, culminating in \u2018Hunted\u2019 being named Album Of The Year for 2016 by Decibel Magazine.\n\nAfter wrapping up the Decibel Magazine Tour with Enslaved, Wolves In The Throne Room and Myrkur, the excitement for Khemmis\u2019s third album, \u2018Desolation,\u2019 is palpable across the metal spectrum.

Like other eager beaver politicians-in-training, he went to every political fundraiser under the sun \u2026 but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming, lackluster, loud and un-neighborly. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world \u2013 crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop \u2013 and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the \u201clittle orchestra\u201d Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for progressive causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education and parks.\n\n\u201cPink Martini draws inspiration from the romantic Hollywood musicals of the 1940s or \u201850s \u2026 with a more global perspective. We write a lot of songs \u2026 but we also champion songs like Ernesto Lecuona\u2019s \u201cAndalucia\u201d or \u201cAmado mio\u201d from the Rita Hayworth film \u201cGilda\u201d or \u201cKikuchiyo to mohshimasu (My name is Kikuchiyo)\u201d made famous in the 1960s by the great Japanese group Hiroshi Wada & His Mahina Stars. In that sense we\u2019re a bit like musical archeologists, digging through recordings and scores of years past and rediscovering beautiful songs.\u201d\n\nLauderdale met China Forbes, Pink Martini\u2019s \u201cDiva Next Door\u201d lead vocalist, at Harvard. He was studying history and literature while she was studying English literature and painting. Actually neither of them really studied, they socialized \u2026 and late at night, they would break into the lower common room in their college dormitory and sing arias by Puccini and Verdi \u2013 and the occasional campy Barbara Streisand cover \u2013thus sealing their creative collaboration. Three years after graduating, Lauderdale called Forbes who was living in New York City, where she\u2019d been writing songs and playing guitar in hew own folk-rock project, and asked her to join Pink Martini. They began to write songs together for the band. Their first song \u201cSympathique\u201d \u2013 with the chorus \u201cJe ne veux pas travailler\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want to work\u201d) \u2013 became an overnight sensation in France, and was even nominated for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at France\u2019s Victoires de la Musique Awards.\n\n\u201cBoth China Forbes and I come from multicultural families,\u201d says Lauderdale. \u201cAll of us in Pink Martini have studied different languages as well as different styles of music from different parts of the world. So inevitably, because everyone has participated at some point in the writing or arranging of songs, our repertoire is wildly diverse. At one moment, you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a samba parade in Rio de Janeiro, and in the next moment, you\u2019re in a French music hall of the 1930s or a palazzo in Napoli. It\u2019s a bit like an urban musical travelogue. We\u2019re very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad \u2026 and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent \u2013 through our repertoire and our concerts \u2013 a broader, more inclusive America \u2026 the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world \u2026 comprised of people of every country, every language, every religion.\u201d\n\nPink Martini has twelve musicians performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia and New Zealand and North America. Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with over 25 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center and the BBC Concert Orchestra in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year\u2019s Eve over the past 15 years; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in NYC; the Governor\u2019s Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; and the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia.\n\n\u201cThe overarching goal is to create a cohesive body of beautiful songs with beautiful melodies. And then it all just extends outward from there. Because the interests of the band are so diverse \u2013 two percussionists who spend a lot of time in Brasil; another percussionist who grew up in Cuba; a German speaking trombone player who studied with all the brass section of the Chicago Symphony and likes Miles Davis; an African American singer who studied French and Italian and sings in 14 different; languages; a cellist who speaks Mandarin \u2013 because of this diversity inside the band, there are endless ideas. On a bad day it can just seem all too dizzying. But hopefully in the larger picture, it is a more accurate representation of America in 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cPink Martini represents all that Toronto aspires to \u2013 sophistication, cosmopolitanism, and a type of delight that sometimes involves dressing up and carousing \u2026 with its heterogeneous tastes and facility in languages, the pop orchestra might have sprung from our own diverse metropolis, but hails instead from Portland, Oregon.\u201d -- Toronto Star, March 2008\n\nThe band has collaborated and performed with Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Henri Salvador, Jane Powell, Chavela Vargas, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, DJ Dimitri from Paris, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Hiroshi Wada, DJ Johnny Dynell and several drag queens from New York City, among others.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Philthy Rich", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9693433.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Tue Dec 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-10", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Rap", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "It's Philthy!

His contributions to iconic music, music education, and the gear that drummers use, are many. Modern Drummer magazine has inducted Weckl into their Hall of Fame (2000) and named him \"one of the 25 best drummers of all time.\"\n\nThese honors, in addition to many more bestowed by the music community, are the product of Weckl's commitment to excellence. His dynamic and diverse drumming, which has inspired musicians worldwide, is built on a foundation of knowledge and passion.\n\nWeckl was born in St. Louis Missouri, January 8th, 1960. Though his parents were not professional musicians, his mother loved music and his father played the piano as a hobby. Weckl started drums at the age of 8, playing along to records in a spare room. He eventually moved his kit into the living room where he sometimes accompanied his father who played piano.\n\nEarly on, Weckl practiced to rock records by the Monkees, Credence Clearwater Revival, and more. Rock drumming came easily and his interest quickly turned to Buddy Rich, Louie Bellson, Philly Joe Jones, and Steve Gadd, to name a few. In his early teens, Weckl's passion for jazz and big band drumming reallly blossomed.\n\nDuring his high school years, Weckl received many awards from the NAJE (National Association of Jazz Educators) for outstanding performances in his high school's competition-winning jazz band. He also became involved with numerous local groups starting at the age of 16 while studying with St. Louis-area teachers Bob Matheny and Joe Buerger.\n\n1979 saw a move to the East coast and the University of Bridgeport. While playing the New York club scene with a band called Nite Sprite, Weckl started receiving accolades from established studio musicians such as Steve Kahn, Michael Brecker, and Peter Erskine. It was Erskine who recommended Weckl for his first 'big gig' with a group called French Toast, forerunner to the Michel Camilo band. That band featured iconic electric bass player Anthony Jackson.\n\nFrom this group, Jackson recommended Weckl for the prestigious 1983 Simon and Garfunkel reunion tour. This got Weckl noticed by a much larger industry audience and lead to many session opportunities, including radio and TV jingles, sound track sessions, and top recording dates with George Benson, Peabo Bryson, Diana Ross, Robert Plant, and many more.\n\nIn 1985, Michael Brecker recommended Weckl to Chick Corea for his new Elektric Band. That was the beginning of a seven-year relationship with both the Elektric and Akoustic bands where nine recordings and three videos were produced. The Akoustic Band release earned Weckl a Grammy.\n\nThe Elektric Band showcased Weckl's cutting-edge drumming and innovative use of electronic and acoustic drums, bringing him worldwide recognition. Though the Elektric Band went on a 10-year hiatus in the early '90s, the band still tours from time-to-time. They released a 17-part conceptual album entitled To The Stars in mid-2004, and have reunited for tours in 2011 and 2016/17.\n\nWeckl's solo career began in 1990 with the release of Master Plan. Co-written/produced with longtime St. Louis friend/colleague Jay Oliver, the album was a watershed moment in Weckl's career. Some would say it ushered in a new generation of contemporary drumming.\n\nMaster Plan featured a dynamic and diverse collection of tracks featuring top jazz artists of the time. The album created a palette for Weckl's wide-ranging abilities in jazz, fusion, and Latin-inspired music, solidifying him as an emerging leader in the drumming world.\n\nThe album's title track, written and performed by Chick Corea, featured Weckl and Steve Gadd on drums. Weckl had been seen as a protege to Gadd and their styles meshed perfectly on the track. But in many ways, the tune marked a \"passing of the torch\" in terms of next-generation artistry on the drums.\n\nWeckl has recorded and produced nine other solo/leader recordings to date. In addition to Master Plan, Heads Up and Hard-Wired earned him great notoriety in the early '90s.\n\nIn 1998, Weckl realized his long-time goal of forming a world-touring band. The Dave Weckl Band released five studio records, including: Rhythm Of The Soul, Synergy, Transition, Perpetual Motion, and Multiplicity. The band also released a hot live album, LIVE (And Very Plugged In) plus a compilation of DWB and instructional videos entitled The Zone.\n\nInstructional videos have always played a big role in Weckl's career. His original product, entitled Contemporary Drummer + 1, was one of the first play-along products ever published for drums. His Back To Basics and The Next Step releases were best-sellers in the '90s and also continue to sell today.\n\nWeckl updated his technical approach in the '90s after studying with Freddie Gruber. He then released a three-part series of videos called A Natural Evolution, which included an appearance by Gruber. These products redefined earlier concepts to help drummers understand how to play in a relaxed, efficient, and musical way. They also helped solidified Weckl's stature as an articulate and respected teacher. His clinics and master classes continue to attract capacity crowds worldwide.\n\nAfter many years of sideman work with guitar legend Mike Stern, Chris Minh Doky's Nomads, Oz Noy, and more, Weckl spent 2013 reuniting with Jay Oliver. They launched a crowd funding campaign that attracted more than 2,000 pre-orders of a project that would eventually be called Convergence.\n\nThe album featured 10 tunes, including piano and drum solo pieces and a remake of Stevie Wonder's legendary tune \"Higher Ground.\" The video of \"Higher Ground\" has been viewed millions of times on YouTube and Facebook. Drummer Chris Coleman, bassist Jimmie Johnson, guitarist Dean Brown, singer Chrissi Poland, and several amazing horn players and vocalists took part.\n\nThe project also saw collaborations with Canadian singer Emilie-Claire Barlow and Riverdance creator Bill Whelan. Oliver recorded several native Irish instruments at Whelan's personal studio in Ireland.\n\nConvergence was released with three companion products: a play-along package for drums, a play-along package for all other instruments on the album, and a full-length documentary entitled Flies On The Studio Wall.\n\nIn 2015, Weckl formed an acoustic jazz group with longtime friend/collaborator Tom Kennedy (bass), Gary Meek (sax), and Makoto Ozone (piano/B3). The group was called The Dave Weckl Acoustic Band. To date, the band has released a CD entitled Of The Same Mind and a live DVD filmed at Catalina Jazz Club in Hollywood.\n\nMore recently, Weckl has returned to touring with the Elektric Band, Mike Stern, and Oz Noy, while completing sessions in his Los Angeles-area home studio. He has also formed an online school with comprehensive lessons, new play along products, and live footage from current tours.\n\nHe says \"it is my goal to inspire as many young (and not-so-young) people as possible to want to play music, whether it be on drums or another instrument. With all the negatives in the world today, I feel this is my way of contributing a positive action toward spiritual happiness, which music can be a big part of, if you let it. So parents, if your child has a talent for music, please allow them the opportunity to develop that\ntalent!\"\n\nOutside of music, Weckl has a passion for automobiles and racing. He and his Corvette ZO6 regularly post competitive times at race tracks around Southern California. Check out his YouTube racing channel!\n\nBeyond music and four-wheel indulgences, Dave's biggest passions and sources of inspiration come from his daughter, Claire, and his wife, Clivia.\n\nA future college graduate (psychology), Claire definitely has the music gene. She sang an amazing version of \"Cups (You're Gonna Miss Me)\" for the Convergence album. Her talent, passion, and work ethic make her father proud every day.\n\nDave's wife, Clivia (also formerly a singer) has a love and passion for music - and an amazing energy for everything life has to offer. She and Dave share time both in Italy and Los Angeles.", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Mike Stern, Jeff Lorber, Jimmy Haslip, Dave Weckl"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Jaden", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/199120.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Tue Dec 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "JADEN & WILLOW"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Raices", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/1297681.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Tue Dec 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "*Dayramir Gonz\u00e1lez \"Afro Cuban Jazz\""}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "X", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9047201.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Tue Dec 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-10", "Genre": "Genres: Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "X"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Teo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6594903.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Tue Dec 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "Sydney boasts tons of talent in dance music but recently the fresh-faced generation of spinning play-pressers have made marks and stained the industry forever- like Teo.

Growing up in the Washington, D.C. area, Stern revered all three of those guitar immortals, along with such potent blues guitarists as Albert and B.B. King. Aspects of those seminal influences can be heard in his playing on the 18 recordings he has released as a leader or in his acclaimed sideman work for Miles Davis, Billy Cobham, the Brecker Brothers, Jaco Pastorius, Steps Ahead, David Sanborn, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Joe Henderson and the all-star Four Generations of Miles band.\n\nStern\u2019s latest Concord Jazz release, Eleven, is an encounter with Grammy-winning keyboardist-composer-producer Jeff Lorber. Co-produced by bassist Jimmy Haslip, who had previously worked with the guitarist on the Yellowjacket\u2019s 2008 album, Lifecycle, this lively collaboration finds Stern at the peak of his powers, following on the heels of 2017\u2019s acclaimed Trip, his triumphant return to recording after a freak accident that threatened to end his career. The multiple Grammy-nominated guitarist was hailing a cab outside his apartment in Manhattan July 3, 2016 when he tripped over some hidden construction debris left in the street, fracturing both of his humerus bones (the long bones that run from the shoulder to the elbow) in the fall. Left with significant nerve damage in his right hand which prevented him from doing the simplest tasks, including holding a pick, Stern faced a series of surgeries and subsequent physical therapy before he could regain control of his nerve-damaged picking hand. And while Trip represented a strong comeback, the intrepid guitarist takes things up a notch on Eleven.\n\n\u201cWhen the idea was floated for this project, I asked a bunch of cats who worked with Jeff, like Randy Brecker, Dave Weckl and Bob Franceschini, and they all said, \u2018He\u2019s cool, he throws down, he can really get it going.\u2019 And they\u2019re right,\u201d said Stern. \u201cJeff\u2019s got a strong rhythmic groove and he comps really well on the Fender Rhodes, which is kind of his signature sound. And I feel like his music really comes more from soul music than smooth jazz. That Philly soul thing is definitely in some of his tunes on this record.\u201d\n\nAdded Lorber of their first collaboration together, \u201cMike\u2019s just a bebop wizard, he\u2019s got an incredible jazz feeling. And by the same token, he\u2019s got the rock and blues thing covered too. He\u2019s on both sides of the musical spectrum. So when I heard he was up for it, I was delighted to have a chance to work with him in the studio on this project. And I think we really hit it off musically as well as personally.\u201d\n\nOne of the top guitarists in jazz since his breakthrough days with Miles Davis' celebrated comeback band of the early 1980s, Stern has earned the respect of colleagues and critics alike while also exerting a towering influence on a generation of aspiring players. A guitarist of formidable technique, he continues to awe and inspire six-string aficionados with his seamless blend of bebop facility, scorching rock intensity and uncommon lyricism. As Jon Chappell of Guitar magazine noted, \u201cStern is not only a magician of the fretboard but a heartfelt and mature composer of great depth.\u201d By combining the legato approach of jazz saxophone greats like John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and Joe Henderson with a few touches from the rock camp (i.e., distortion and delay pedals along with some urgent string bending, courtesy of his boyhood blues heroes B.B. King and Buddy Guy), Stern has successfully fashioned a singular voice that comfortably occupies both rock and jazz worlds.\n\nBorn on January 10, 1953, he began playing guitar at age 12, emulating the likes of B.B. King, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. \u201cI liked the feel of the guitar and I got hooked on it,\u201d he recalled in an interview. \u201cBut I didn't really get serious about it until I went to Berklee in 1971.\u201d At the Berklee College of Music in Boston his focus shifted to jazz as he began an intensive period of woodshedding, immersing himself in records by Miles Davis, John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner and Bill Evans while studying with guitarists Mick Goodrick and Pat Metheny. During his stint at Berklee, he developed a keen appreciation for jazz guitar greats Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall, both of whom would exert a huge influence on his own playing. On a recommendation from Metheny, Stern landed a gig with Blood, Sweat & Tears in 1976 and remained with the band for two years, appearing on the BS&T albums More Than Ever and Brand New Day. That gig is also significant for introducing the guitarist to two musicians who would later figure prominently in his life \u2014 percussionist Don Alias and bassist Jaco Pastorius.\n\nFollowing his stint with BS&T, Stern returned to Boston and began studying privately with local jazz guru Charlie Banacos. In 1979, he joined Billy Cobham's powerhouse fusion band and two years later he joined Miles Davis' group, making his public debut with the band on June 27, 1981 at the Kix nightclub in Boston (a performance that was documented on the CBS live album, We Want Miles). Stern remained with Miles through 1983, also appearing on Man With The Horn and Star People). From 1983 to 1984, he toured in Jaco Pastorius' Word Of Mouth band and in 1985 returned to Miles for a second tour of duty that lasted close to a year.\n\nIn 1985, Stern made his recording debut as a leader with Neesh on the Japanese Trio label. A year later, he made his Stateside debut as a leader on Atlantic Records with Upside Downside, which featured such celebrated colleagues as alto saxophonist David Sanborn, tenor saxophonist Bob Berg, bassists Mark Egan, Jeff Andrews and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardist Mitch Forman and drummers Dave Weckl and Steve Jordan. In the summer of 1986, Stern took to the road with David Sanborn and later joined an electrified edition of Steps Ahead, which featured Mike Mainieri on midi vibes, Michael Brecker on the Electronic Wind Instrument (EWI), Darryl Jones on electric bass and Steve Smith on drums. That powerhouse fusion outfit was documented on Live in Tokyo 1986. Over the next two years, Stern was a member of Michael Brecker\u2019s potent quintet, appearing on the tenor titan\u2019s 1988 album, Don\u2019t Try This At Home.\n\nStern's second Atlantic album, 1988's Time In Place, continued the promise of his debut and featured Peter Erskine on drums, Jim Beard on keyboards, Jeff Andrews on bass, Don Alias on percussion and Don Grolnick on organ. He followed that success with 1989's Jigsaw, which was produced by fellow guitarist Steve Khan. Following the release of 1991\u2019s Odds or Evens, Stern joined a reunited Brecker Brothers Band in 1992 and became a key factor in the success of that popular group for the next two years. His decidedly jazzy 1993 Atlantic release, Standards (And Other Songs), led to Stern being named Best Jazz Guitarist Of The Year by the readers and critics of Guitar Playermagazine. He followed that success with two hard-hitting offerings in 1994's Is What It Is and 1996's Between The Lines, both of which received Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1997, Stern returned to a jazzier aesthetic with Give And Take, a looser, more spontaneous session featuring bassist John Patitucci, drummer Jack DeJohnette, percussionist Don Alias and special guests Michael Brecker and David Sanbom. On the strength of that superbly swinging effort, which included freewheeling covers of Sonny Rollins' \u201cOleo,\u201d John Coltrane's \u201cGiant Steps\u201d and Cole Porter's \u201cI Love You,\u201d along with a scintillating trio rendition of Jimi Hendrix's \u201cWho Knows,\u201d he was awarded the Orville W. Gibson Award for Best Jazz Guitarist.\n\nStern\u2019s ninth release on Atlantic, 1999\u2019s Play, was a six-string summit meeting with fellow guitarists John Scofield and Bill Frisell. He followed with 2001\u2019s Voices, his first album to employ singers (Arto Tuncboyaciyan, Elizabeth Kantomanou, Richard Bona) and 2004\u2019s These Times, which featured guest turns from banjo ace Bela Fleck and alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett. 2006\u2019s Who Let The Cats Out? featured a bevy of bassists in Meshell Ndegeocello, Anthony Jackson, Richard Bona and Victor Wooten along with drummers Kim Thompson and Dave Weckl and harmonica ace Gregoire Maret and the late, great trumpeter Roy Hargrove.\n\nAt the Festival International de Jazz de Montr\u00e9al in June 2007, Stern was honored with the Miles Davis Award, which was created to recognize internationally acclaimed jazz artists whose body of work has contributed significantly to the renewal of the genre. Stern was also the artist in residence at the festival that summer of 2007, joining the renowned Yellowjackets for some electrifying live performances. Their kinetic chemistry was later documented on the 2008 studio collaboration Lifecycle, which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album.\n\nThe following year saw the release of his Grammy-nominated Big Neighborhood, which found Stern with guitar heroes Eric Johnson and Steve Vai, trumpeter Randy Brecker and jamband godfathers Medeski, Martin & Wood on a few tracks.\n\nStern was presented with Guitar Player magazine\u2019s Certified Legend Award on January 21, 2012. In June of that year, he released All Over the Place, which featured a delegation of high-caliber electric and acoustic bass players, including Esperanza Spalding, Richard Bona, Victor Wooten, Anthony Jackson, Dave Holland, Tom Kennedy, Will Lee and Victor Bailey. On 2014\u2019s Eclectic, Stern went toe-to-toe with Texas guitar slinger Eric Johnson, cutting a wide stylistic swath on eleven originals while showcasing their mutual love of Jimi Hendrix on a cover of his slow blues classic, \u201cRed House.\u201d Recorded in three days at Johnson\u2019s studio in Austin, Electric was hailed as \u201ca dazzling outing from two formidable, well-matched guitar heroes\u201d by Jazz Times magazine.\n\nThe guitar great continued to play with peerless authority while flaunting prodigious chops on 2017\u2019s Trip and now exhibits that same impressive six-string prowess on Eleven.", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Mike Stern, Jeff Lorber, Jimmy Haslip, Dave Weckl"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Allah-Las", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9248467.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Tue Dec 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-10", "Genre": "Genres: Garage Rock, Rock, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "www.allah-las.com", "otherInfo": "Doors: 8:00 pm / Show: 9:00 pm"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Half Stack", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Tue Dec 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $10 Adv & $12 Day of Show\nMotel Radio with support from Half Stack & Sour Widows"}, {"Address": "116 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Seisiun", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.460518, 37.783375], "Date": "Tue Dec 10 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Plough and the Stars", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Seisi\u00fan at Plough & Stars: Throwing back pints to a live soundtrack of traditional jigs and reels gives this Richmond watering hole a notably authentic Irish feel.

Fans will be familiar with Donna from her years of touring with Madonna, but her music has its own compelling vision. Inspired by Indian devotional music and dance beats from around the globe as well as western pop, Donna\u2019s songs blend diverse styles\n\nfor a sound that\u2019s as natural as it is unique.\n\n\n\nSky Is Open, her album before Sanctuary, is remarkable for a sound that\u2019s expansive and intimate, deeply layered and subtle, immediate and ageless. Donna\u2019s clear pure vocals possess an emotive power that can be enchanting and ardent, elegant and earthy; a voice rich with emotional nuance and understated soul, a sound that goes straight to your heart. It took Donna almost two years to complete Sky Is Open and her care and attention to craft is evident in every note. \u201cI had a sound in my head that I wanted to get out.\n\n\n\nAs an independent artist with a limited budget and a child to raise it was challenging, but I worked at night, in my home studio, whenever I could.\u201d With the aid of co-producer Mac Quayle (Annie Lennox, Toni Braxton, New Order) and long time collaborator Cameron Stone, Donna fashioned an extensive palette of warm acoustics, inviting electronic textures and her own exceptional vocals. \u201cThey\u2019re all love songs, even those that sound spiritual,\u201d she explains. Donna completed Sky Is Open with the help of many friends and collaborators, including cellist Cameron Stone, Krishna Das, who lends his distinctive vocals to the title track, songwriting ace Eric Bazilian, producer Anthony Resta (Collective Soul, Duran Duran) and the members of her band: Cameron Stone on cello, Mark Gorman on bass, and Dave Allen on drums and percussion.\n\n\n\nOn Sky Is Open rhythms and melodies from around the globe ebb and flow creating a transcendent pulse. \u201cFade In Time\u201d opens with a sample of Swami Satchidananda intoning the \u201cGayatri Mantra,\u201d the holiest prayer of the Hindu cannon. Donna\u2019s whispered vocal slowly builds to a cry of pleading passion, complimented by a classic, almost liturgical synthesizer line, soaring electric guitars and Anthony Resta\u2019s dramatic percussion. Subtle, percolating Indian percussion and a sensuous,\n\nhypnotic bass line introduce \u201cGlow.\u201d Cameron\u2019s luxurious cello and Donna\u2019s Sanskrit chanting give the song a bright, airy feel.\n\n\n\nDonna is at her most emotional on \u201cOne Day,\u201d a song of hurt and healing that\u2019s dark and light, spooky and spiritual. Cameron\u2019s cello, Paul Bryan\u2019s swooping bass, the soaring guitar of Jerry Leonard (David Bowie) and Donna\u2019s impassioned vocals lend the song a warm, wide-open vibe. The title song, \u201cSky Is Open\u201d unfolds slowly. Subtle keyboard textures and a percussion track that blends Western and Eastern rhythms give the song a meditative feel. Marty Allen\u2019s sitar, the measured\n\nchanting of Krishna Das and the way Donna\u2019s subtle, smoky vocals float effortlessly through the the mix add to the music\u2019s soulful energetic feel. Joseph Arthur\u2019s \u201cIn The Sun,\u201d the album\u2019s one cover, was originally a dark rock tune. Donna and Cameron slow it down, adding a countermelody on cello that gives the lyric a devotional quality. The album\u2019s themes of infinite love, devotion and redemption give the album a spiritual essence, fulfilling Donna\u2019s stated goal of making music\n\nwith a positive message. Donna was raised in a musical home in Calabasas, CA. Her grandfather played cello and upright bass for the Warner Brothers Studio Orchestra, her mother was a singer and dancer and her father, Al De Lory, was a musician who played\n\nkeyboards with Phil Spector\u2019s Wrecking Crew. He contributed keyboards to the Beach Boys landmark Pet Sounds album and produced Glen Campbell\u2019s classic hits of the 60s and 70s. Donna began performing at a young age making her professional debut at age eight singing a Recipe dog food commercial. By junior high she had already contributed her voice to projects by Kim Carnes, Barry Manilow and Santana, the Rocky II soundtrack as well as warbling the theme song for Disneyland's \u201cIt's A Small World\u201d ride.\n\nWhen she was sixteen, Donna\u2019s mother died and she moved to Nashville, where her father found a home on Music Row. \u201cI hung out on Music Row singing demos and made friends with a lot of songwriters,\u201d Donna recalls. \u201cI worked in a vegetarian restaurant, became vegetarian, the first step on the path toward the life I\u2019m living now. Being around songwriters and seeing the attention they paid to their craft inspired me. I decided I wanted to be an artist and a songwriter. I picked up\n\na guitar and realized I had a talent for it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from High School, Donna went back to LA to study dancing, singing and acting. A demo tape of her singing Madonna\u2019s \u201cOpen Your Heart\u201d reached Pat Leonard, Madonna\u2019s producer, and she became an integral part of his productions for artists like Ray Parker, Jr. and Carly Simon. Leonard helped her land a gig as one of Madonna\u2019s singing/dancing stage companions. Donna became an integral part of Madonna\u2019s performing troupe. She\u2019s worked with Madonna on six international tours including the Who\u2019s That Girl, Blonde Ambition and Drowned World Tours. Donna also had a part in the infamous documentary Truth or Dare.\n\n\n\nIn 1993 Donna released her self-titled debut on MCA. Most of the songs on the album were self-penned; critics praised the sincerity of her vocals and the record\u2019s winning blend of up-tempo dance tunes and heartfelt ballads. She had a #1 single in Japan with \u201cPraying For Love\u201d and a top 10 dance hit in the U.S. with \u201cJust a Dream.\u201d Touring to support her CD introduced Donna to a whole world of music she\u2019d never heard before: \u201cI went to Brazil, Israel, Turkey and many other countries and was influenced by the music I heard. Those rhythms and melodies opened my ears and my heart and I discovered a whole new way of expressing myself musically.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Donna grew musically, she looked for ways to make her music deeper, richer, more resonant and ultimately, more spiritual. When she met cellist Cameron Stone she began to hone a new sound that combined her pop experience and emerging interest in world music with his classical training. They called their unique musical hybrid, and the album, Bliss. Released on her own label and recorded in a studio Donna and Cameron built with their own hands - was an instant success, praised for Donna\u2019s fervent vocals and the depth and complexity of the arrangements. She supported the album by touring\n\nthe usual mainstream clubs like House Of Blues, but the strong spiritual vibe of Bliss made the album a favorite at healing centers and yoga studios and led to performances in churches and other spiritual places. \u201cWhen you play in a space like that, people are so into the music,\u201d Donna says. \u201cThey want to be taken away; they\u2019re closing their eyes, letting go and really listening.\u201d Others were listening as well. Superstar club DJ/producer Junior Vasquez remixed \u201cOn & On\u201d and it hit the Top 20 on Billboard's Club Dance chart. Music from the album continues to be widely licensed for film and TV including the daytime drama Passions and the Lifetime Network series Beyond Chance.\n\n\n\nSky Is Open blends the material sentiments of Bliss with the spiritual sensitivity of Lover and The Beloved to deliver songs that are both secular and devotional, a winning blend of international beats and a pop sensibility. \u201cI\u2019m further along on my path, so that devotional, self realized aspect is there in the music,\u201d Donna says. In concert, Donna delivers a seamless blend of mantra and English devotional songs accompanied by her own harmonium and piano along\n\nand musical collaborator Cameron Stone on cello. \u201cPlaying music is my bliss,\u201d Donna says. \u201cI realize that being able to do this is a gift. If I can inspire people to better appreciate the people they love or get in touch with their own bliss, then I\u2019ve\n\ndone what I\u2019m here to do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "More information and tickets TBA!"}, {"Address": "999 California St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Ricardo Scales", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.410248, 37.791405], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Top of the Mark", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ricardo Scales at Top of the Mark: This famed martini bar offers high-class wallpaper music on the weekends, including lounge piano, easy listening, classical, and some jazz combos.

As one of the core artists on the Ghostly International label roster since the early 2000s, Willits has continually evolved his craft, producing one of the most diverse and prolific catalogs within contemporary ambient music. Releases span introspective solo albums, widescreen audiovisuals, and unbridled collaborations including two albums with Ryuichi Sakamoto and productions with Tycho. Willits is also the director and co-founder of the nonprofit, Envelop; leading a mission to amplify the connective power of music through immersive audio venues and spatial audio production tools. His process is an expression of love, inspired by an international audience of listeners, and the conviction that music can catalyze personal transformation and spiritual awakening.\n\nWillits began his career with a string of critically acclaimed albums on the 12k label. The minimal sound introduced on those recordings remains at the core of his work: warm guitar tones woven into smooth, harmonic surfaces. Willits made his Ghostly International full-length debut with 2006 landmark Surf Boundaries. He\u2019d expand his vision next through collaboration, working with Ryuichi Sakamoto (2008\u2019s Ocean Fire and 2012\u2019s Ancient Future), Zach Hill of Death Grips, Taylor Deupree, and, for 2014 LP Opening, with the whole band of Tycho. He also lent a hand in mastering the latter\u2019s album Awake, composed the original score for documentary The Art of Listening, and continues to lead music production and meditation classes in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2017, Willits put forth Horizon, the first ever spatial audio release on Ghostly International. The album\u2019s innovative 3D mix is mapped to surround listeners and align with sleep patterns, meditation, and other mindful practices. Willits is also the director and co-founder of the nonprofit, Envelop; leading a mission to amplify the connective power of music through immersive audio venues and spatial audio production tools. Like Horizon, his 2019 album Sunset utilizes Envelop\u2019s cutting-edge technology to encourage listening from within. The five compositions move from warm to cool designed as a soundtrack to embrace the day's end; a collective letting go. Another skyward, pioneering project from an artist who occupies a unique corner of the electronic music universe.\n\nArtist statement:\n\"When I was 12, I realized that my life\u2019s path was to make music in the service of love and healing. Music is a medicine that allows us to feel, listen, and ultimately surrender to the present moment. The compositions I create move through my imagination, heart, and hands, like guitar through a speaker, and light through a lens. I am continuously learning and evolving with the process; a practice of letting go of all that I create, as it creates me.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Support Envelop's 2020 nonprofit projects and enjoy an immersive set by Christopher Willits and a Tycho DJ set after a community dinner.Join us for Envelop's annual gathering and support our 2020 nonprofit projects and initiatives!

Like other eager beaver politicians-in-training, he went to every political fundraiser under the sun \u2026 but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming, lackluster, loud and un-neighborly. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world \u2013 crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop \u2013 and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the \u201clittle orchestra\u201d Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for progressive causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education and parks.\n\n\u201cPink Martini draws inspiration from the romantic Hollywood musicals of the 1940s or \u201850s \u2026 with a more global perspective. We write a lot of songs \u2026 but we also champion songs like Ernesto Lecuona\u2019s \u201cAndalucia\u201d or \u201cAmado mio\u201d from the Rita Hayworth film \u201cGilda\u201d or \u201cKikuchiyo to mohshimasu (My name is Kikuchiyo)\u201d made famous in the 1960s by the great Japanese group Hiroshi Wada & His Mahina Stars. In that sense we\u2019re a bit like musical archeologists, digging through recordings and scores of years past and rediscovering beautiful songs.\u201d\n\nLauderdale met China Forbes, Pink Martini\u2019s \u201cDiva Next Door\u201d lead vocalist, at Harvard. He was studying history and literature while she was studying English literature and painting. Actually neither of them really studied, they socialized \u2026 and late at night, they would break into the lower common room in their college dormitory and sing arias by Puccini and Verdi \u2013 and the occasional campy Barbara Streisand cover \u2013thus sealing their creative collaboration. Three years after graduating, Lauderdale called Forbes who was living in New York City, where she\u2019d been writing songs and playing guitar in hew own folk-rock project, and asked her to join Pink Martini. They began to write songs together for the band. Their first song \u201cSympathique\u201d \u2013 with the chorus \u201cJe ne veux pas travailler\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want to work\u201d) \u2013 became an overnight sensation in France, and was even nominated for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at France\u2019s Victoires de la Musique Awards.\n\n\u201cBoth China Forbes and I come from multicultural families,\u201d says Lauderdale. \u201cAll of us in Pink Martini have studied different languages as well as different styles of music from different parts of the world. So inevitably, because everyone has participated at some point in the writing or arranging of songs, our repertoire is wildly diverse. At one moment, you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a samba parade in Rio de Janeiro, and in the next moment, you\u2019re in a French music hall of the 1930s or a palazzo in Napoli. It\u2019s a bit like an urban musical travelogue. We\u2019re very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad \u2026 and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent \u2013 through our repertoire and our concerts \u2013 a broader, more inclusive America \u2026 the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world \u2026 comprised of people of every country, every language, every religion.\u201d\n\nPink Martini has twelve musicians performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia and New Zealand and North America. Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with over 25 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center and the BBC Concert Orchestra in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year\u2019s Eve over the past 15 years; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in NYC; the Governor\u2019s Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; and the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia.\n\n\u201cThe overarching goal is to create a cohesive body of beautiful songs with beautiful melodies. And then it all just extends outward from there. Because the interests of the band are so diverse \u2013 two percussionists who spend a lot of time in Brasil; another percussionist who grew up in Cuba; a German speaking trombone player who studied with all the brass section of the Chicago Symphony and likes Miles Davis; an African American singer who studied French and Italian and sings in 14 different; languages; a cellist who speaks Mandarin \u2013 because of this diversity inside the band, there are endless ideas. On a bad day it can just seem all too dizzying. But hopefully in the larger picture, it is a more accurate representation of America in 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cPink Martini represents all that Toronto aspires to \u2013 sophistication, cosmopolitanism, and a type of delight that sometimes involves dressing up and carousing \u2026 with its heterogeneous tastes and facility in languages, the pop orchestra might have sprung from our own diverse metropolis, but hails instead from Portland, Oregon.\u201d -- Toronto Star, March 2008\n\nThe band has collaborated and performed with Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Henri Salvador, Jane Powell, Chavela Vargas, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, DJ Dimitri from Paris, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Hiroshi Wada, DJ Johnny Dynell and several drag queens from New York City, among others.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Drew Southern Band", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Drew Southern Band at Boom Boom Room: Couches and cocktails complement a blues and funk boogie, which makes shaking it on the checkerboard dance floor an old-fashioned must.

His legendary shows with his longtime band Silvertone have entertained tens of thousands of people for over two decades. Even his hair has its own fan club. And yet, this highly praised herald platinum-selling artist has never released a greatest hits album.\n\nHard to believe, no? Well, unlike some artists who roll out a greatest hits package after, say, their second album, Isaak waited until he actually had enough hits to legitimately describe the collection as such.\n\n\"Shouldn't a greatest hits collection after two records be called 'Greatest Hit'?\" Isaak asks. \"I guess I've just always been too busy making records. Plus, it takes a while before you really want to compile everything. But after going through all the songs to make the Best Of, I feel like we have good stuff.\"\n\nGood stuff. That's typical Isaak self-deprecation- it's much more than good stuff. Best Of Chris Isaak-the CD and accompanying DVD, which features 18 video clips by such esteemed directors as Gus Van Sant, Bruce Weber, Herb Ritts, Mary Lambert and Jean-Baptiste Mondino-take listeners on a gratifying musical journey through the Stockton, Calif., native's two-decade career, showcasing his stellar songwriting; smooth, dusky baritone (and tender falsetto that will alert your dog); and effortless brand of stylish retro-cool.\n\nThe album displays Isaak's many different musical personas: the rockabilly rebel (\"Dancin',\" \"Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing,\" \"Speak Of The Devil\"), the brokenhearted crooner (\"Wicked Game,\" \"Somebody's Crying\"), and the breezy acoustic storyteller (\"San Francisco Days,\" \"Two Hearts\"). It includes two brand new songs, the elegant \"King Without A Castle\" and the break-up exhortation \"Let's Have A Party,\" as well as two covers: Cheap Trick's power-pop anthem \"I Want You To Want Me,\" a live favorite previously unavailable on any of his CDs (\"It's kind of fun to do something a little different for me,\" Isaak says), an inspired version of his hero Roy Orbison's classic lovelorn ballad \"Only The Lonely,\" and a stirring never before heard acoustic version of \"Forever Blue.\"\n\n\"What a sweet guy Roy was,\" Isaak says. \"We opened for him one time and after the show I said to him, 'I don't know if I write hits or not,' and he said, 'You write hits, you just don't know it.' It was exactly what I needed to hear at the time to keep me going for another year.\"\n\nThat was before noted director David Lynch used \"Wicked Game,\" a spare, moody ballad from Isaak's third album, Heart-Shaped World, in the film Wild At Heart. The song went Top Ten in 1991, and the video, a steamy Herb Ritts-directed clip featuring the singer rolling around on the beach with a topless Helena Christensen, made Isaak a star. \"'Wicked Game' really put us out there,\" he says. \"We were on the road at the time, and got to ditch our van and get into a bus. For the first time in years, we got some sleep!\"\n\nAnother significant hit included on Best Of is the south-of-the-border-flavored ballad \"Somebody's Crying\" from 1995's Forever Blue (both the single and album were nominated for Grammy awards in 1996). \"I wrote that song in a closet,\" Isaak says. \"I had just broken up with someone and hadn't been out of the house much. A friend of mine was having a party and as soon as I arrived I realized I didn't want to be there. The house had this big walk-in closet in the hallway, so I went in, shut the door, and sat down underneath the coats. There was a guitar leaning against the wall in the back. I started tuning it up and wrote 'Somebody's Crying.'\"\n\nThen there's the swaggering, bluesy rocker \"Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing\" (also from Forever Blue), which can be heard in Stanley Kubrick's 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. The director asked Kidman what music she wanted to rehearse the movie's striptease scene to. \"Nicole had been listening to the track and brought it in to run through for her rehearsal,\" Isaak recalls. \"Stanley said, 'I love it,' and put it in the film. I owe Nicole Kidman a full body massage.\"\n\nSo what were Isaak's criteria for a song's inclusion on the album? \"I wanted it to be a record that people want to listen to over and over,\" Isaak says. \"I tried to pick songs that people request most when we play live, and then make sure it was balanced between slow and fast tunes.\"\n\nWhile reviewing tracks, some going back to the mid-'80s, Isaak says what struck him most was how lucky he has been to have the people he works with around him, such as producer Erik Jacobsen (\"who taught me everything I know about making records, but not everything he knows\"), longtime engineer Mark Needham, and his Silvertone bandmates, drummer Kenney Dale Johnson, bassist Rowland Salley, and guitarist Hershel Yatovitz, who have been with Isaak for years. \"People see my picture on the album covers and think, 'Chris goes into a room and he makes an album.' But I go into a room and make it with these guys, who've been supportive, and have good ideas and good energy.\"\n\nAnd to what does he attribute the longevity of his career? \"You know, I've never tried to jump on a trend, and I've never had to jump off of one,\" he says. \"I try to do what feels right for each song. So I never have to go, 'Well, no more disco for me.'\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Aviva le Fey", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9184454.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "Genres: dream folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1728 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Jorge Glem", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8143287.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272021, 37.807671], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "Genres: M\u00fasica Venezolana", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Piedmont Piano Company", "moreBioInfo": "JORGE GLEM (1982).

Blockhead grew up in downtown New York City. As the son of an artist, surrounded by visual culture, he early on found that his passion was for music, for the sonic. A fan of a whole range of sounds, especially hip-hop, Blockhead steadily built a tremendous collection of tapes and later CDs from innumerable artists, a quiet accumulation of knowledge and know-how. After a brief stint as a rapper, he realized his calling was behind the boards and not on the mic \u2013 and from there began to produce beats. Since making that decision, he's kept pretty busy: carving a niche as a sought-after underground beatmaker that people call when they want something special. Blockhead produced nine tracks on Aesop Rock's critically acclaimed album Labor Days. Additionally, he produced half the tracks on Aesop Rock's follow-up EP, Daylight. He has also worked with other indie giants Atmosphere, Murs, Mike Ladd, and Illogic. In between, he found time to complete a break beat album entitled Blockhead's Broke Beats, with 10 hard-hitting instrumental tracks, which was released on Mush Records.\n\nBlockhead\u2019s debut album on Ninja Tune, Music By Cavelight, was described as \u201cone of the most fantastically good albums you\u2019re going to hear this year\u201d (Sunday Telegraph) and \u201ca beautiful record\u201d (Metro), with Blockhead himself tipped as \u201cdefinitely one to watch\u201d (Touch). Blockhead returned in 2005 with Downtime Science, another set of deep, emotional instrumental hip-hop tracks, this time dedicated to the downtown area of Manhattan where he grew up and has lived his entire life, encompassing all the attitude, anger and edginess of the neighborhood. This expansive album also features some melancholy reflections upon failed relationships and the promise of future loves.\n\nThe Music Scene was released in 2009 to both critical acclaim and commercial success \u2013 launching Blockhead on a global string of headlining dates ranging from Pittsburgh to Poland \u2013 where he participated in the world famous Zubroffka Festival, providing a live score for some of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s earliest films. Blockhead followed this album with 2012\u2019s Interludes After Midnight, further showcasing his development as a solo artist with a unique voice.\n\nMore recently, Blockhead has self-released a string of full-length albums (Bells and Whistles in 2014, Funeral Balloons in 2017), in addition to teaming up with UK\u2019s music publisher DeWolf Music to create The Art of Sampling (2017). Capitalizing on the producer\u2019s ability to twist unexpected material into new, modern music, DeWolf opened their vaults to Blockhead and let him go wild. Earlier this year, Blockhead released the collaborative effort Free Sweatpants featuring Aesop Rock, Open Mike Eagle and countless other rappers.\n\nBlockhead will release his new solo record this fall on Future Archive Recordings.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Scrabbel", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/155050.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "SAY SUE ME\nScrabbel\n8 pm\n$15\nAll Ages"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "X", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9047201.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "Genres: Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "X"}, {"Address": "765 Center Blvd, Fairfax, CA 94930", "Artist": "Scott Guberman", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8809008.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.584093, 37.985925], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Rock, Rock, Rock \\, Roll, Beyond", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Iron Springs", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Guberman performs regularly with Grateful Dead's founding bassist, Phil Lesh.\n\nScott Guberman has become an outstandingly important member of the Bay Area music scene in between his shows with Phil Lesh, appearing most often at Terrapin Crossroads.

Dedicating their 1996 debut 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi' to bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim, the Washington, D.C.-based duo have spent nearly two decades creating boundary-warping, complexly crafted electronic music partly inspired by bossa nova\u2019s intricate rhythms and lush textures. Now, with their seventh studio album 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation present their first release devoted entirely to the Brazilian-born genre that first connected them. \u201cWe always try to progress into something different and stretch our musical chops, and taking a whole album to dive into this one sound seemed like a really great way to do that,\u201d says Hilton. Adds Garza: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a departure for us, but at the same time these are our roots, this is what brought us together. It\u2019s us coming full circle from electronic music back to something organic before we move on to our next chapter.\u201d\n\n\n\nReleased on their own label ESL Music, 'Saudade' borrows its title from a Portuguese word meaning \u201ca longing for something or someone that is lost, a contented melancholy, or, simply, the presence of absence.\u201d \u201cSaudade is the essence or feeling of true bossa nova,\u201d explains Hilton, who names \u201cthose warm, soulful, melancholic vocals\u201d as one of the elements of bossa nova that\u2019s most alluring to him. Drawing influence from classic Brazilian performers like Antonio Carlos Jobim, Gal Costa, and Luis Bonf\u00e1\u2014along with Serge Gainsbourg, Ennio Morricone, and more modern artists like electro-samba pioneer Isabelle Antena\u2014Saudade achieves its delicate yet deeply sensuous sound with the help of more than a dozen guest musicians. With each track sung by one of five female vocalists (including longtime Thievery cohort LouLou Ghelichkhani, newcomer Elin Melgarejo, Nouvelle Vague singer Karina Zeviani, Argentine chanteuse Natalia Clavier, and former Bitter:Sweet singer/songwriter Shana Halligan), the endlessly mesmerizing album also features such guests as U.N.K.L.E. drummer Michael Lowery, Argentine singer/songwriter Federico Aubele, and master Brazilian percussionist Roberto Santos.\n\n\n\nAlthough Thievery Corporation stay true to traditional bossa nova\u2019s elegant fusion of samba and jazz all throughout 'Saudade,' the album is rich with strange and wonderful flourishes that revel in the duo\u2019s hyper-inventive tendencies. Opening with the dusky \u201cD\u00e9collage,\u201d 'Saudade' glides from the smoldering and string-drenched \u201cQuem Me Leva\u201d to the hushed and mysterious \u201cSola In Citta\u201d (an Italian-sung nod to the legendary sound tracks of Ennio Morricone, featuring Wurlitzer electric piano by Enea Diotaiuti) to the sweetly ethereal \u201cNo More Disguise\u201d (a dream-like piece laced with orchestral strings and bolero rhythms). With the instrumental title track serving as its gently stunning centerpiece, 'Saudade' also offers the sultry and spacey\u201cClaridad\u201d (a swaying Latin number propelled by analog organ beats) and the French lullaby of \u201cLe Coeur\u201d (featuring the sublime saxophone work of Frank Mitchell, Jr.). And on the final track \u201cDepth of My Soul,\u201d Halligan delivers a haunting vocal performance that merges with the song\u2019s swirling symphonic soundscape to hypnotic effect.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Thievery Corporation have given nods to their bossa-nova influence on individual album tracks, slipping those quietly enchanting songs into recordings that reveal the duo\u2019s careful studying of everything from Jamaican dub reggae to punk to vintage film soundtracks to psychedelic space rock. After coming up with sketches for several bossa-nova-style numbers while recording their last studio album (2011\u2019s Culture of Fear), Garza and Hilton considered releasing an EP showcasing a handful of Brazilian-inspired songs. \u201cThe more we worked on those songs, the more we got into the vibe of that vintage, organic sound,\u201d recalls Hilton. \u201cMaking an album fully dedicated to that sound felt like a good idea, especially at a time when the electronic dance music world is so saturated and there\u2019s not much of a focus on musicianship.\u201d Rather than feeling hemmed in by the unfamiliar approach of creating music solely in one style, Thievery Corporation found a great deal of freedom in writing and recording the songs that make up 'Saudade.' \u201cIn a way it was really liberating to do something out of our wheelhouse, to put ourselves in a totally different mindset and immerse ourselves in this one particular genre,\u201d notes Garza.\n\n\n\nIntense musical exploration has always been essential to Thievery Corporation, a project hatched in 1995 when Hilton and Garza were introduced by a mutual friend at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Eighteenth Street Lounge\u2014a popular gathering spot for musicians that\u2019s co-owned by Hilton. Soon after making their 1996 debut with two underground hit vinyl singles(\u201cShaolin Satellite\u201d and \u201c2001 Spliff Odyssey\u201d) and 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi,' the duo became loosely associated with the trip-hop scene that had newly emerged in the UK. In 2000, they released 'Mirror Conspiracy,' which introduced live vocalists (including Bebel Gilberto and the late Pam Bricker) into the project\u2019s mix. Following 2002\u2019s 'The Richest Man in Babylon' and 2005\u2019s 'The Cosmic Game' (featured politically minded collaborations with Perry Farrell, Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne, and David Byrne), Thievery Corporation put out 2006\u2019s 'Versions' (a compilation of their remixes of songs by such artists as Sarah McLachlan, Astrud Gilberto, Anoushka Shankar, and The Doors). By then, Garza and Hilton were itching to evolve past their reputation as ambassadors of the downtempo scene, and began to conjure up more subversive recordings that reflected their passion for social activism, as heard on both 2008\u2019s 'Radio Retaliation' and 'Culture of Fear.'\n\n\n\nNow on 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation are once again changing direction, trading the fiery energy of their last two albums for a wistful mood and summery spirit\u2014a shift that both members found highly refreshing. \u201cEven though we\u2019re very socially conscious, it\u2019s nice to take a break from the political theme and just concentrate creating some beautiful songs in the same vein as all these old records that we love,\u201d says Garza. And as one ofthe most influential and respected names on the electronic/dance music scene, Thievery Corporation also discovered their own breed of rebellion and innovation in committing themselves to a time-worn genre on 'Saudade.'\u201cWe\u2019re still chopping up beats, but this time we\u2019re making them sound warm and vintage\u2014which is not at all what\u2019s happening in electronic music right,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is pretty traditional and timeless-sounding, and in that it\u2019s completely contrarian.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Bill Orcutt", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Bottom of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Bill Orcutt w/ Preening, Mike Donovan"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Chase Burnett", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9322721.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463777, 37.783225], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "Genres: folk, Indie Rock, Singer, Songwriter, Experimental", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Neck Of the Woods", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Julia Nunes, Elizabeth and The Catapult, Chase Burnett at Neck of the Woods"}, {"Address": "610 Coleman Ave, San Jose, CA 95110", "Artist": "Robert Counts", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8991811.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.90887, 37.3413], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Americana, Folk", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Club Rodeo", "moreBioInfo": "Debut EP available NOW!\nhttps://smarturl.it/RobertCountsEP", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "853 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Gaucho", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7519822.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421068, 37.759319], "Date": "Wed Dec 11 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-11", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Acoustic, Swing", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Amnesia", "moreBioInfo": "Gaucho is a masterful Bay Area band that combines the influence of gypsy jazz of 1930\u2019s Europe with the rhythmic drive and collective improvisation of New Orleans swing music, gutbucket blues and elements of ragtime.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Like other eager beaver politicians-in-training, he went to every political fundraiser under the sun \u2026 but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming, lackluster, loud and un-neighborly. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world \u2013 crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop \u2013 and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the \u201clittle orchestra\u201d Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for progressive causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education and parks.\n\n\u201cPink Martini draws inspiration from the romantic Hollywood musicals of the 1940s or \u201850s \u2026 with a more global perspective. We write a lot of songs \u2026 but we also champion songs like Ernesto Lecuona\u2019s \u201cAndalucia\u201d or \u201cAmado mio\u201d from the Rita Hayworth film \u201cGilda\u201d or \u201cKikuchiyo to mohshimasu (My name is Kikuchiyo)\u201d made famous in the 1960s by the great Japanese group Hiroshi Wada & His Mahina Stars. In that sense we\u2019re a bit like musical archeologists, digging through recordings and scores of years past and rediscovering beautiful songs.\u201d\n\nLauderdale met China Forbes, Pink Martini\u2019s \u201cDiva Next Door\u201d lead vocalist, at Harvard. He was studying history and literature while she was studying English literature and painting. Actually neither of them really studied, they socialized \u2026 and late at night, they would break into the lower common room in their college dormitory and sing arias by Puccini and Verdi \u2013 and the occasional campy Barbara Streisand cover \u2013thus sealing their creative collaboration. Three years after graduating, Lauderdale called Forbes who was living in New York City, where she\u2019d been writing songs and playing guitar in hew own folk-rock project, and asked her to join Pink Martini. They began to write songs together for the band. Their first song \u201cSympathique\u201d \u2013 with the chorus \u201cJe ne veux pas travailler\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want to work\u201d) \u2013 became an overnight sensation in France, and was even nominated for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at France\u2019s Victoires de la Musique Awards.\n\n\u201cBoth China Forbes and I come from multicultural families,\u201d says Lauderdale. \u201cAll of us in Pink Martini have studied different languages as well as different styles of music from different parts of the world. So inevitably, because everyone has participated at some point in the writing or arranging of songs, our repertoire is wildly diverse. At one moment, you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a samba parade in Rio de Janeiro, and in the next moment, you\u2019re in a French music hall of the 1930s or a palazzo in Napoli. It\u2019s a bit like an urban musical travelogue. We\u2019re very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad \u2026 and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent \u2013 through our repertoire and our concerts \u2013 a broader, more inclusive America \u2026 the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world \u2026 comprised of people of every country, every language, every religion.\u201d\n\nPink Martini has twelve musicians performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia and New Zealand and North America. Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with over 25 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center and the BBC Concert Orchestra in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year\u2019s Eve over the past 15 years; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in NYC; the Governor\u2019s Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; and the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia.\n\n\u201cThe overarching goal is to create a cohesive body of beautiful songs with beautiful melodies. And then it all just extends outward from there. Because the interests of the band are so diverse \u2013 two percussionists who spend a lot of time in Brasil; another percussionist who grew up in Cuba; a German speaking trombone player who studied with all the brass section of the Chicago Symphony and likes Miles Davis; an African American singer who studied French and Italian and sings in 14 different; languages; a cellist who speaks Mandarin \u2013 because of this diversity inside the band, there are endless ideas. On a bad day it can just seem all too dizzying. But hopefully in the larger picture, it is a more accurate representation of America in 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cPink Martini represents all that Toronto aspires to \u2013 sophistication, cosmopolitanism, and a type of delight that sometimes involves dressing up and carousing \u2026 with its heterogeneous tastes and facility in languages, the pop orchestra might have sprung from our own diverse metropolis, but hails instead from Portland, Oregon.\u201d -- Toronto Star, March 2008\n\nThe band has collaborated and performed with Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Henri Salvador, Jane Powell, Chavela Vargas, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, DJ Dimitri from Paris, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Hiroshi Wada, DJ Johnny Dynell and several drag queens from New York City, among others.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "KOLARS", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8971622.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Thu Dec 12 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-12", "Genre": "Genres: Space Blues, Desert Disco, Rock, Roll, New Wave, Glam Rock, Glamabilly", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "HUFFINGTON POST: \"Instantly fell in love with their tantalizing sonics, and their energetic, apocalyptic marvel\"\n\nCONSEQUENCE OF SOUND: \"Takes your heart by the hand and leads you to the dance floor, daring you to not feel motivated to dance, shimmy, just escape the mundane.\"\n\nTIME OUT: \u201cA superb punch of musical bliss.

Rounding out the rest of the band are Andrew Zehnal (drums), Adam Bock (keys), and Chris Urriola (bass). The band has been releasing music since 2013, during which they released an EP and two albums along with a Record Store Day tribute to the Velvet Underground's LOADED album. The group has toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe, both on their own and supporting the likes of Citizen Cope, Counting Crows, Jackie Greene, Jesse Malin, the Zombies, and many more. And you've heard their music in films such as \"Bad Country\" and on TV series such as Showtime's \"Shameless,\" Epix's \"Get Shorty,\" DirecTV's \"Kingdom\" and MTV's \"Real World.\" Also their music has been featured in the worldwide trailer for \u201cThe Founder\u201d starring Michael Keaton along with the Winter 2018 John Varvatos runway show and online campaign.\n\nHollis Brown is a (hard) working rock 'n' roll band, in other words, a group that lives up to the blue-collar legacy of their hometown. But, as evidenced on their new album Ozone Park, there's also a great deal of sophistication in the mix, rich melodicism and advanced harmonics that allow Hollis Brown -- yes, named after the Bob Dylan song -- to blend a wealth of influences into a distinctive sound that plants their own one-of-a-kind flag in ground that's been otherwise well-traveled.\n\n\"We really feel like the last of the great American rock bands,\" Montali explains. \"When you play rock music it's always kind of a hurdle to not be considered a retro band or a throwback band because somebody is always trying to put you in a box or define you. You're always compared to another artist, another band -- who are great, sometimes, but they're...old. I think we want to make a statement that rock music can still be done in a modern way that is still as good as some of those acts from the past.\"\n\nThat's exactly what Hollis Brown set out to do -- \"Great songs but rock 'n' roll with the sound of 2019\" -- on the 10 tracks of Ozone Park, which was recorded at Unity Gain Studios in Fort Meyers, Fla. The songs cover plenty of musical ground but this is no mere playlist; rather, they weave together in a cohesive, dynamically exciting ride that ranges from the soulful buoyancy of \"Blood From a Stone\" and \"Stubborn Man\" to the ringing Americana guitars of \"She Don't Love Me Now,\" the funky flavor of \"Go For It\" and the fuzzy hard rock of \"Bad Mistakes.\" It represents care and craft, and a diversity Montali credits to his own musical roots.\n\n\"Growing up in Queens I fell in love with all different types of music,\" he recalls. \"we had hip-hop, we had funk music, we had rock 'n' roll music, we had singer-songwriters. Everybody in the band loves all those things, so it's nice to try and incorporate all those things. We're really open.\n\nMaking Ozone Park with producer Adam Landry (Deer Tick, Rayland Baxter, Nikki Lane, Vanessa Carlton) in Fort Myers, Fla., Hollis Brown enjoyed plenty of opportunity for rewarding musical adventures. Some of it had to do with the recording process itself, mixing analog and digital technologies as well as the sound of four musicians -- Montali, Bonilla, keyboardist Adam Bock and drummer Andrew Zehnal -- playing together in one room. \"We did a lot of pre-production and did the album pretty quick -- eight days, recorded and mixed,\" Montali says. \"We did some sampling, some 808 digital drums on some of the songs and synth stuff we weren't doing before, just to make the sound current. But if it's a great song it's always a great song, no matter how you dress them up.\"\n\nMontali and his mates are also proud of \"the real band sound\" they achieved on Ozone Park. \"My favorite thing about bands is if you take one member out, it changes,\" he explains. \"If you look at Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, the Ramones -- each member brings his own power. I think we got to that place on this record; if you take one member out of our group, it wouldn't have been the same record. We really developed how these songs would sound with just the four of us before we even went into the studio.\" Hollis Brown opted to give themselves that time, too. The group stayed off the road for the better part of the year, not only recording but rebuilding their business team and putting strategies in place for what the band felt was a pivotal work.\n\n\"It was a challenging year for us,\" Montali says. \"We're so used to playing so much, being home and not playing was something very different. But it was all worth it. We felt like it was time to take a step back and get the right team together so that when this album comes out we're firing on all cylinders. \"I think we're in a really good place now. We just want to keep the ball rolling and making music we believe in.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Christian Sedelmyer", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8800188.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Thu Dec 12 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads", "moreBioInfo": "violins. fiddles. tasty sounds.\nnashville, tn\nhttp://www.christiansedelmyer.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "The Soft White Sixties", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8761278.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Thu Dec 12 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-12", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Roll, R&B, Soul, Psych Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "ALTA CALIFORNIA is out now!\nAvailable worldwide in English or Spanish\nthesoftwhitesixties.com", "otherInfo": "KOLARS"}, {"Address": "311 Broadway, Oakland, USA", "Artist": "Claymore", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8176011.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.276005, 37.797178], "Date": "Thu Dec 12 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-12", "Genre": "Genres: Symphonic Metal", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Elbo Room Jack London", "moreBioInfo": "The Bulgarian Symphonic Progressive Black Metal band CLAYMORE is formed in the summer of 1999 in the city of Ruse. Founding members are Kamen(drums), Martin(guitar) . Choosing the keyboard was complex and after three months of auditions we chose Tsvetelin(keyboards) - He became one of the pillars of Claymore. After a number of changes over the years, the current staff is: Martin - guitar; Kamen - drums; Tsvetelin - keyboards; Emil - vocals&bass;\n\nCLAYMORE quickly became popular among Bulgarian fans with unique and pure style of melodic death/black metal combining aggression and melody in one with influences from other styles like heavy,thrash,death,grind as well as a good amount of classical music. Their first ever performance is in September 1999 to start a long tour in many cities across Bulgaria captivating audiences everywhere. This earns them a place at the biggest Bulgarian Underground Music Festival (Bourgas 2000). This was the beginning ...\n\nAt the end of 2000 CLAYMORE record their first demo tracks quickly followed by a demo CD tilled \"Warriors of Claymore\" which is posted on many web magazines and played on radio shows in Bulgaria and abroad.\n\nDuring 2002 CLAYMORE worked hard on the sound quality for the recording of the actual demo \"Released\" consisting of 5 songs. These songs representtheir style and part of their live shows.\n\nCLAYMORE 's remarkable popularity and success earns them a place in \"Trash till Death\", \"Heatework festival\", \"Heart Rock festival\", \"Chaos fest\", \"Massacre Fest\", \"Legacy Open Air Fest\", \"Barock Fest\", \"Nightmare Fest\", \"Ost festival\",\"Sea Black Festival\",\u201dUrpin Fest\u201detc. where they played along side well known international bands like Destruction , Dimmu Borgir , Primordial , Mystic Circle , Napalm Death , Sinister , Lord Belial , Graveworm , Eastern Front , Exumer , Negura Bunget , Izegrim , Spoil Engine , Zombie INC , etc. CLAYMORE recorded their first full-lenght album \"Prolonged Active Antagonism\" and took part in \"Black Curse Over Europe\" tour in 2008. The album is out on D.O.P. (Bulgaria). Official mp3 distributors are Forces of Satan (Norway), Toxicity Records \u2013 Vodafone Live (Bulgaria).\n\nThey want to spread their music among the Underground circles all over the world\n\n.That actually happens- completion of the second album \"Vengeance is Near\" led to a deal with the Japanese label Red Rivet Records great step in the progress of the band . Included is the song \"Centuries of chaos part II\" compilation magazine TERRORIZER issue 247\n\nAfter much effort, the band realized another dream: In 2014, CLAYMORE make his first European tour \"Vengeance is Near\" which passes through Poland,Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria. The second tour (2015)\"Between Two Worlds\" covers more countries - Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany.

In between tours, Sweeney was working on the songs that would make up the album Peace Meal from an apartment overlooking the Pacific Ocean as well as Faraway Sound in Brooklyn, NY. The goal was to make this record quickly, before questions on the meaning of it all could reach him. Then, on a fateful night in April 2018, just as the final mixes for the album were being completed, an astrological grip intercepted Sweeney\u2019s life when he awoke to find his infant daughter no longer breathing and the toughest of life\u2019s questions falling all around him.\nA \u201cpillar of San Francisco's garage-psych community\u201d (TheBayBridged), Luke Sweeney has been a working musician for over a decade, playing with a wide variety of cohorts such as Tim Cohen (Fresh & Onlys), Tyson Vogel (Two Gallants), and Healing Potpourri. His personal output has always sparked interest among the interesting - an artist\u2019s artist, so to speak - as he \u201cconfounds aural expectations and puts the knock on reverence\u2026 with time-worn allusions to psychedelia, bubblegum, glam, and mellow Seventies balladry\u201d (Austin Chronicle) and \u201ca kaleidoscopic whoosh of psych-pop, indie-folk, lo-fi soul and futuristic blues\u201d (Bend Bulletin). Now, while those muses are still very present in his approach, the arrival of Peace Meal feels like something of a rebirth. Perhaps the songs were the fruit of a communicative collaboration between this plane of existence and another; Sweeney says the lyrics to \u2018Great Wide Ocean\u2019, written on the studio floor long before his daughter Rishi was conceived, came to him as if sent from another realm.\nMeanwhile, breezy melodies and buoyant beats soundtrack what is musically Sweeney\u2019s most pop-oriented album to date: \"It is easy to hear why this album has a healing quality for Sweeney; Peace Meal digs deep and balances a strong introspective slant with melodies reaching out for listeners and inviting them into its musical world. It deserves consideration as his finest work yet\" (Too Much Love).

He began co-writing and recording and producing with the New Jersey based band Dog Show Blues. During this time he also worked on what would later become his debut album. Attributing much of his inspiration to his three older brothers, he named the solo project The Fourth Son. His debut album The Fourth Son EP was released in 2014. In the winter of 2015, The Fourth Son relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, and began developing a live presence. He played at open-mic nights throughout the Bay Area, while teaching elementary physical education by day. He released his second album titled Lavenia in 2016. With an increasing number of tour dates the project has developed a unique and powerful live sound.

He\u2019s been praised by the Cascade Blues Association for his \u201cstunning guitar playing\u2013 the pure Chicago styled sound\u201d, and his fans love Johnny\u2019s take on the intense, stripped-down \u201cWest Side sound\u201d of Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Buddy Guy. Johnny is a Delmark and Vizztone recording artist with 9 CDs to his credit. He was nominated for a BMA for Best Traditional Blues CD of 2017 for \u201cHowlin\u2019 at Greaseland\u201d, a Howlin\u2019 Wolf tribute.\n\nJohnny Burgin grew up in Starkville MS and Greenville SC, and while he was still in high school, he got to see many touring blues bands such as Guitar Jr, Gatemouth Brown and Eddie Clearwater. His father was an actor and folk musician and taught him the basics on guitar. He went to University of Chicago with the intention of becoming a writer, but a different path unfolded and he fell headfirst into the Chicago blues scene. Things started happening fast after Johnny (at that time featuring guest vocalist Jimmy Burns) took a Monday night residency at the Smoke Daddy in Chicago\u2019s Wicker Park neighborhood. They soon became a strong draw, and the atmosphere they generated was so electric that Bob Koester of Delmark Records offered them a contract after hearing just one set.\n\nSince those days, Johnny played the Chicago blues festival many times, toured Europe regularly, and has headlined festivals all over the US. Over the years, he has developed from a blues guitar slinger and local blues hero into a fully fledged singer, harmonica player, a dynamic and engaging bandleader, and a mature, seasoned guitarist. One look at Johnny\u2019s tour schedule confirms his status as an in-demand blues performer. He puts on the kind of satisfying and exciting show that only years of touring can develop.

He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

On Signs & Signifiers (Rounder, April 17), McPherson\u2019s seductively kickass debut album, produced by JD\u2019s musical partner, Jimmy Sutton, this renaissance man/hepcat seamlessly meshes the old and the new, the primal and the sophisticated, on a work that will satisfy traditional American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and R&B purists while also exhibiting McPherson\u2019s rarefied gift for mixing and matching disparate stylistic shapes and textures.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are little subcultures within the roots scene, where people are really into rockabilly, traditional hillbilly stuff or old-timey music,\u201d JD points out, \u201cbut there aren\u2019t a whole lot of folks making hard-core rhythm & blues hearkening back to Specialty, Vee-Jay or labels like that. That\u2019s what Jimmy and I really like, and our only intention going in was just to make a solid rhythm & blues/rock \u2019n\u2019 roll record. But I didn\u2019t want to make a time-machine record, so we tried to make something relevant but with all the things we love about rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and rhythm & blues and mesh it all together. We both have eclectic tastes; Jimmy likes the Clash as much as he likes Little Richard, and I like the Pixies, T.Rex, hip-hop and all kinds of stuff. So we came up with a couple of weird songs and put them on the record, hoping that it wouldn\u2019t scare off any of our ultra-selective fanbase.\u201d\n\n\n\nJD needn\u2019t have worried. It\u2019s highly unlikely that even the most discerning listeners would guess that the arrangement on his cover of Tiny Kennedy\u2019s R&B chestnut \u201cCountry Boy\u201d incorporates not only the tambourine beat of Ruth Brown\u2019s 1955 Atlantic single \u201cMama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean,\u201d but also Raekwon and RZA\u2019s \u201cabstract, out-of-tune piano loops\u201d on Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s innovative \u201993 LP Enter the Wu-Tang; or that the mesmerizing churner \u201cSigns & Signifiers\u201d is powered by an unchanging tremolo guitar figure modeled on Johnny Marr\u2019s part on the Smiths\u2019 \u201cHow Soon Is Now.\u201d Then there\u2019s \u201cFirebug,\u201d which JD \u201cwanted to sound as if Stiff Little Fingers had recorded at Del-Fi Records.\u201d And while it may not have been specifically what McPherson and Sutton were going for, the haunting dreamscape \u201cA Gentle Awakening\u201d seems to chart a course from \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d through Terence Trent D\u2019Arby to Amy Winehouse.\n\n\n\nNever has an album of so-called \u201cretro\u201d music been laced with such a rich payload of postmodern nuance. But that was precisely the intent of what JD describes, only half-facetiously, as \u201can art project disguised as an R&B record.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d says Sutton, \u201cwhen you grow up being a fan of \u2018older\u2019 music and all of a sudden you\u2019re making a record, you\u2019re thinking, are we just recreating something\u2014a museum piece\u2014or are we actually bringing it forward? It\u2019s interesting, because if you make something today and it moves you today, in that sense it\u2019s contemporary. I like that juxtaposition of classic and fresh, something old yet new that can actually take you somewhere now.\u201d\n\n\n\nOf course, pushing the genre envelope doesn\u2019t work unless the artist has the chops and feel to capture the form in its pure state to begin with. Check out, for example, \u201cDimes for Nickels,\u201d McPherson\u2019s vital evocation of the very moment when R&B and hillbilly music had a baby and they called it rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, or the Jackie Wilson-meets-Elvis exuberance of \u201cScratching Circles,\u201d or the lascivious ecstasy of the Little Richard doppelganger \u201cScandalous,\u201d (although the \u201cgold-capped tooth\u201d reference in the first line is lifted from the Leiber-Stoller Coasters classic \u201cLove Potion #9\u201d). But for all we know, these tracks, too, may have been secretly embedded with elements from far afield, their stylistic twists hiding in plain sight. This cat is wicked-clever\u2014and man, can he ever deliver this righteous shit.\n\n\n\nMcPherson took a circuitous path to get to this point. Broken Arrow butts up against Tulsa, a cultural oasis in the Heartland that has long been not only a musical hotbed but also a bustling center of the contemporary arts. \u201cTulsa\u2019s got a lot of resources for people who are into weirdo art,\u201d JD points out. And he gravitated toward it. \u201cI did my undergraduate studies at the University of Oklahoma in experimental film,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to paint, do installation, make video art, performance stuff, sculpture. I\u2019ll bet I\u2019m the only person to have received graduate credit hours in card magic.\u201d He wound up with an M.F.A. from the University of Tulsa in open media, a discipline designed specifically for his interests and ambitions.\n\n\n\nBut all along the way, music was an integral part of McPherson\u2019s life. His dad introduced him to Delta blues and jazz as a kid, and after getting into Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and punk rock during high school, he picked up a Buddy Holly box set. \u201cSomething about that scratched an itch,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I started getting into the black side of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll: Larry Williams, Little Richard, Art Neville\u2019s stuff on Specialty, then soul and Jamaican rocksteady.\u201d While studying visual arts, he also played in bands, doing everything from punk to western swing. JD was still scratching that itch when he recorded some originals with his previous band and took a shot in the dark. Well aware of Sutton\u2019s status as a heavy hitter on the roots scene and the leader of R&B group the Four Charms, he fired off a MySpace friend request and asked if the producer/bassist would listen to his demos.\n\n\n\n\u201cI get sent stuff all the time, and it\u2019s always the same,\u201d says Sutton, \u201cbut I checked JD out and there was definitely something there. He wowed me\u2014his voice, his songwriting. So we started talking, and we were always on the same page about the music we dig and where we wanted to take it. He had great ideas but he was still an open book. I was just trying to push him to stay true to himself. So the idea became to create a record that was honest and live.\u201d\n\n\n\nSix months into their budding partnership, JD arrived at Sutton\u2019s newly completed home studio in Chicago\u2014a sort of working shrine to all-tube recording as it was practiced a half-century ago, right down to Jimmy\u2019s collection of vintage mics and his early-\u201960s Berlant/Concertone quarter-inch tape machine. Also on hand was Sutton\u2019s go-to guy Alex Hall, \u201ca Brian Eno type\u201d according to JD, who multitasks as engineer, drummer and keyboard player.\n\n\n\n\u201cI showed up and I said, \u2018I got this song \u2018Dimes for Nickels,\u2019 and I want it to be like a Chess Chuck Berry thing, slowed down, with a flat-tire beat,\u2019\u201d JD remembers. \u201cJimmy and Alex are from Chicago\u2014they know that stuff backwards and forwards\u2014and we nailed it in two takes.\u201d Within a week, they\u2019d banged out a dozen tracks, recording during the day and writing at night with a guitar and a laptop.\n\n\n\nIn order to make sure the album got heard by JD\u2019s potential core audience, Sutton threw some chum in the water, pressing up a limited run on his brand-new Hi-Style label and directing it at the roots community. JD and Jimmy, who\u2019s also a visual artist, then applied those skills to the making of a striking video for opening track \u201cNorth Side Girl,\u201d which has now registered well over 350,000 YouTube views.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the album came out, we immediately got a really strong response from that crowd,\u201d JD recalls. \u201cThen we put that video out, and it went all over the place within a week. Not too long after that, we started getting calls from managers, prospective booking agents, and it turned into this weird journey. By early last year, we were talking to some major labels and the folks at Rounder, who found out about us from the video. What made it the perfect storm was, as all that was happening, I lost my job\u2014I was a middle school art teacher. I loved that job but, sign of the times, they started laying off the art department and I was part of the fallout. So I collected my paycheck through the summer and toured.\u201d After which he signed with Rounder.\n\n\n\nHaving finally decided on his artistic direction, JD isn\u2019t looking back. \u201cAlthough I grew up wanting to be a visual artist, I\u2019ll tell you what: the most satisfaction I\u2019ve ever had as an artist is right now,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause as much as I love artists like Joseph Beuys, I love David Bowie and Little Richard more. I was doin\u2019 OK, I had some things going, but I\u2019d rather do this, make music the priority. There\u2019s more instant gratification\u2014you play a show and right away you feel like it\u2019s something worthwhile, and a lot of people are in on it. So I\u2019m definitely into continuing to explore all this stuff. It\u2019s really exciting\u2014knock on wood.\u201d\n\n\n\nJD has no doubts about the viability of the choice he\u2019s made. \u201cWorking within a genre has been done in all kinds of mediums\u2014look at Alfred Hitchcock,\u201d he points out. \u201cIt\u2019s been established that rock \u2019n\u2019 roll is a viable form\u2014it\u2019s hard-wired into American brains to understand swinging blues stuff. So it\u2019s not surprising to me that kids are into the Black Keys and Adele. It just had to be presented to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo now it\u2019s JD McPherson\u2019s turn to step up to the plate and give it a good whack.

Not at gunpoint or anything\u2014the two had never even met\u2014but the effect of hearing the songwriting legend's music for the first time had an equally compelling effect on Luning, who was studying film scoring at the Berklee College of Music in Boston at the time. Now an accomplished artist in his own right, Luning is preparing to release his most dynamic and gripping collection to date, 'Restless,' and he can trace it all back to one fateful night that changed everything.\n\n\"A couple of friends invited me over to share some songs at their apartment, and that was the first time I'd ever really listened to Americana music or folk or country or whatever you want to call it,\" remembers Luning. \"They showed me John Prine, and it just resonated with me so much. I was like, 'Oh my god, this is what I have to do with my life.' I just figured it out in that moment.\"\n\nLuning dropped out of school almost immediately, moved back to his native California, and devoted himself to songwriting and performing. He worked his way up through open mics to large festival performances, piecing together a band to flesh out his songs along the way and hitting the road to tour with a fierce determination. His self-released debut album, 'Just Drop On By,' garnered acclaim from both critics and fellow musicians alike, with country megastar Keith Urban hailing Luning's \"staunch originality.\" Songs from the album landed numerous film and TV placements, most recently on NBC's 'Grimm,' and Luning's reputation for exhilarating live performances earned him dates with luminaries like Jackie Greene, Dave and Phil Alvin, and Elvin Bishop, along with a slew of festival performances up and down the West Coast.\n\nIf 'Just Drop On by' announced the arrival of a promising new talent, 'Restless' delivers on that potential and then some. Recorded under the guidance of engineer/producer Karl Derfler (Tom Waits, Dave Matthews) and with Luning's longtime live bandmates\u2014Ben Dubin (bass & harmonica), Linden Reed (drums), and Dave Sampson (guitar & mandolin)\u2014the album marks a major step forward, both sonically and emotionally.\n\n\"With the first record, I produced and engineered everything myself,\" explains Luning. \"I'd never worked with an outside producer before, so it was nerve-racking going into the studio with Karl for the first time, but it was just a perfect fit. It was like he knew what I wanted in my music before I even did, and he could push my performances where they needed to go and really take my music to another level.\"\n\nLuning and his band set up shop at the stunning Panoramic Studios in Stinson, California, crafting a darker, grittier vibe for the music and exploring a wider palette than ever before. While many of Luning's songs are inspired by the lives and stories of the men and women he's grown up with in California or met on the road, the lyrics are all filtered through his own unique perspective and reflect his remarkable personal journey. Perhaps no track fits that bill more directly than \"Driftin,'\" an infectious road warrior's anthem that find's Luning singing, \"I wanna keep on drifting like a rambling man.\"\n\n\"I had so much fun on tour going from place to place and playing to new people all the time and I got into the rhythm of it all, so when it ended and we came home I wasn't ready to stop,\" he explains. \"We pulled into Ben's house to unload our gear and I said, 'Ben, we're packing up and we're gonna go somewhere tomorrow right? We're gonna keep on going right?'\"\nMuch of the album is uptempo and exuberant\u2014\"Almost Sounds Like Laughing\" is a foot-stomping folk tune with the energy of a runaway train\u2014but Luning shows off his remarkable depth and range on some of the record's more restrained tracks, like the slow-burning \"Brother In Chains\" and delicate \"Gonna Forget About You,\" which finds him pulling his vocals back to an intimate near-whisper that conveys a world of heartache and regret. \"In Hell I Am\" started life as an acoustic blues on a resonator guitar before morphing into a fiery, electric rocker, while \"Bet It All On Black\" takes on a harder, Southern edge, with Luning repeating the mantra, \"Ain't no use in holding back.\"\n\n\"It's essentially about a person who's kind of carefree,\" he says, \"and they know that something might not be the best thing to do, but they're going all in with it anyway. They're just going for it, regardless of the outcome and any repercussions they might face.\"\nIf that sounds familiar, perhaps like the attitude of a man who might risk everything to drop out of school and move across the country to pursue a dream, it's no coincidence. With songs this good, it's a safe bet that a restless soul like David Luning is going to keep on traveling for a long time to come.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3202 Mission st, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Steve Lucky & the Rhumba Bums featuring Miss Carmen Getit", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8701972.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42032, 37.74507], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Royal Cuckoo", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "915 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Nikki Glaser", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9078320.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414334, 37.802895], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Cobb's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Stand up comedian.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "550 Barneveld Ave, San Francisco, CA 94124", "Artist": "Fridays", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6069695.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.404709, 37.73995], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "Genres: Blues", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Dance Fridays - Space 550", "moreBioInfo": "Fridays brengt Blues-klassiekers vanuit het Brabantse Tilburg! www.fridaysmusic.nl", "otherInfo": "\"Dance Fridays\" weekly salsa & bachata party"}, {"Address": "44 Race St, San Jose, CA 95126", "Artist": "Them Slack Jawed SOB's", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6263613.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.911581, 37.330495], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Art Boutiki", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "410 Sycamore at Camino Alto, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Mill Valley Philharmonic", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.55, 37.91], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Mt.

In 2008 he met Gallina Tamburo, who was on her own journey of healing. Their shared love of ecstatic music, kundalini yoga, the gong, sound therapy, and sacred chanting set the foundation of their relationship, marriage and eventual musical collaboration. In addition to completing their Kundalini Teacher Training at the mother ashram in Espanola, NM and Yoga For Youth Training with Krishna Kaur they have studied with Gongmasters Don Conreaux and Sotantar.

His concerts and workshops are heart centered, uplifting, sonically multi-dimensional, life affirming experiences that focus on self transformation through conscious listening and breathing. He lives in deep gratitude and joy that his life of music has had meaning and been of use to the world around him. He seeks peace and harmony in his life and hopes to share this peace with others through his music and teachings.\nThrough extensive national tours both solo and with Crown of Eternity, Mike has offered countless workshops, classes, therapy sessions, concerts and retreats and has guided thousands of people to listen deeply, relax, reconnect to themselves and most importantly marvel at the power of sound.\nOver the past 20+ years Mike Tamburo has become well known as a multi-instrumentalist, music educator, interdisciplinary sound artist, video artist, sound therapist, writer, meditation teacher and avid traveler; sharing over 1800 public and private performances and recording more than 65 albums of ecstatic and transcendental music as well as folk, drone, ambient and sometimes unclassifiable sounds. Early in Tamburo's career he gained notoriety for his string playing (hammered dulcimer, guitar and shahi baaja). In many of his early performances he began to enter into altered states of consciousness and have out of body experiences while performing. In order to understand these experiences he went into years of self study; exploring Kundalini Yoga, energy work, the therapeutic use of sound and how sound effects consciousness, human perception and self healing. His love for long sustained drones, overtones and psychoacoustics led him to working with multiple gongs and other tuned metal instruments (bells, sound plates, singing bowls) as well as exploring the healing power of mantra and toning.

Like other eager beaver politicians-in-training, he went to every political fundraiser under the sun \u2026 but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming, lackluster, loud and un-neighborly. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world \u2013 crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop \u2013 and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the \u201clittle orchestra\u201d Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for progressive causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education and parks.\n\n\u201cPink Martini draws inspiration from the romantic Hollywood musicals of the 1940s or \u201850s \u2026 with a more global perspective. We write a lot of songs \u2026 but we also champion songs like Ernesto Lecuona\u2019s \u201cAndalucia\u201d or \u201cAmado mio\u201d from the Rita Hayworth film \u201cGilda\u201d or \u201cKikuchiyo to mohshimasu (My name is Kikuchiyo)\u201d made famous in the 1960s by the great Japanese group Hiroshi Wada & His Mahina Stars. In that sense we\u2019re a bit like musical archeologists, digging through recordings and scores of years past and rediscovering beautiful songs.\u201d\n\nLauderdale met China Forbes, Pink Martini\u2019s \u201cDiva Next Door\u201d lead vocalist, at Harvard. He was studying history and literature while she was studying English literature and painting. Actually neither of them really studied, they socialized \u2026 and late at night, they would break into the lower common room in their college dormitory and sing arias by Puccini and Verdi \u2013 and the occasional campy Barbara Streisand cover \u2013thus sealing their creative collaboration. Three years after graduating, Lauderdale called Forbes who was living in New York City, where she\u2019d been writing songs and playing guitar in hew own folk-rock project, and asked her to join Pink Martini. They began to write songs together for the band. Their first song \u201cSympathique\u201d \u2013 with the chorus \u201cJe ne veux pas travailler\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want to work\u201d) \u2013 became an overnight sensation in France, and was even nominated for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at France\u2019s Victoires de la Musique Awards.\n\n\u201cBoth China Forbes and I come from multicultural families,\u201d says Lauderdale. \u201cAll of us in Pink Martini have studied different languages as well as different styles of music from different parts of the world. So inevitably, because everyone has participated at some point in the writing or arranging of songs, our repertoire is wildly diverse. At one moment, you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a samba parade in Rio de Janeiro, and in the next moment, you\u2019re in a French music hall of the 1930s or a palazzo in Napoli. It\u2019s a bit like an urban musical travelogue. We\u2019re very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad \u2026 and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent \u2013 through our repertoire and our concerts \u2013 a broader, more inclusive America \u2026 the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world \u2026 comprised of people of every country, every language, every religion.\u201d\n\nPink Martini has twelve musicians performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia and New Zealand and North America. Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with over 25 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center and the BBC Concert Orchestra in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year\u2019s Eve over the past 15 years; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in NYC; the Governor\u2019s Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; and the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia.\n\n\u201cThe overarching goal is to create a cohesive body of beautiful songs with beautiful melodies. And then it all just extends outward from there. Because the interests of the band are so diverse \u2013 two percussionists who spend a lot of time in Brasil; another percussionist who grew up in Cuba; a German speaking trombone player who studied with all the brass section of the Chicago Symphony and likes Miles Davis; an African American singer who studied French and Italian and sings in 14 different; languages; a cellist who speaks Mandarin \u2013 because of this diversity inside the band, there are endless ideas. On a bad day it can just seem all too dizzying. But hopefully in the larger picture, it is a more accurate representation of America in 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cPink Martini represents all that Toronto aspires to \u2013 sophistication, cosmopolitanism, and a type of delight that sometimes involves dressing up and carousing \u2026 with its heterogeneous tastes and facility in languages, the pop orchestra might have sprung from our own diverse metropolis, but hails instead from Portland, Oregon.\u201d -- Toronto Star, March 2008\n\nThe band has collaborated and performed with Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Henri Salvador, Jane Powell, Chavela Vargas, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, DJ Dimitri from Paris, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Hiroshi Wada, DJ Johnny Dynell and several drag queens from New York City, among others.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Rockaway Beach Ave, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "Mitch Woods", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6179968.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.497032, 37.609053], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, boogie woogie, Blues Piano, Jump Blues, Swing, New Orleans, New Orleans R, swing, Piano Blues, Rockn Roll", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Nick's Rockaway", "moreBioInfo": "http://mitchwoods.com/about-2/about", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Washington St, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "The AM", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.643119, 38.23494], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Phoenix Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Sandeens headline and are joined by special guests The AM and a special collab set with Kurupi/FourHead/Marais/PHD"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Los Texmaniacs", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8940813.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "Genres: Tex-Mex, World, Roots, Texas, Rock-n-Roll, Conjunto, TX Country, Traditional", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "Grammy Award winners, Los Texmaniacs are the new kings of Tex-Mex .

From his early years playing under the tutelage of bluegrass patriarch Bill Monroe, and following his stint in Old & In the Way with Jerry Garcia and subsequent breakout as both a solo performer and bandleader, Rowan has built a devoted, international fan base through his continuous stream of original recordings, collaborative projects, and constant touring.\n\n\n\nBorn in Wayland, Massachusetts to a musical family, Rowan first learned to play guitar from his uncle. He spent his teenage years absorbing the sights and sounds of the Boston music scene, playing bluegrass at the Hillbilly Ranch and discovering folk and blues across the Charles River at the legendary Club 47 on Mt. Auburn Street in Cambridge. \"I could sit in with the Lilly Brothers at the Hillbilly Ranch and then catch the MTA and be in time for Joan Baez's last set at the Club 47. Bluegrass appealed to me. It was callin' me\u2014the harmonies, that high and lonesome calling-sound. Don Stover had played banjo with Bill Monroe, fiddler Tex Logan too, before they joined the Lillys. Mandolinist Joe Val taught me all the Blue Sky Boys and the Louvin Brothers songs. I would play a \"sock-hop\" with my rockin' group, The Cupids, and then make a beeline for the clubs. Sonny Terry and Brownie Magee, Josh White, Muddy Waters- they all came to town! \"\n\n\n\nFollowing three years in college, Rowan left academia to pursue a life in music. Rowan began his professional career in 1964 as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist for Bill Monroe and The Bluegrass Boys, living in Nashville and playing with Monroe on the Grand Ol' Opry every week. \"One thing I liked about the Monroe style was that there was a lot more blues in it than other styles of bluegrass,\" reflects Rowan. \"It was darker. It had more of an edge to it. And yet it still had the ballad tradition in it, and I loved that.\" Rowan stayed with Monroe and his Bluegrass Boys, touring constantly both in the United States and in England, for two and a half years. \" We went from old-timey places way down south to the colleges up north, we played to all ages, long-time fans of Bluegrass and the college kids my own age.\"\n\n\n\nThe late '60s and early 70's saw Rowan collaborating with musical compatriots in a number of rock, folk and bluegrass combinations: Earth Opera with David Grisman, Sea Train with fiddler Richard Greene (himself a graduate of Monroe's band) Muleskinner with both Grisman and Greene, former Bluegrass Boy banjoist Bill Keith and the great Clarence White. From the ashes of Muleskinner, Rowan and Grisman went on to join Jerry Garcia, Vassar Clements, and John Kahn, forming the legendary bluegrass band Old & In the Way. It was during this time that Rowan penned the song \"Panama Red,\" a subsequent hit for the New Riders of the Purple Sage and a classic ever since. Other time-honored compositions by Rowan include \" Moonlight Midnight\", \" In The Land of the Navajo\" and \"Lonesome L.A. Cowboy\u201d. Jerry Garcia himself recorded Rowan's \"Moonlight Midnight\" and the haunting \"Mississippi Moon\". The 1970\u2019s also saw Peter Rowan playing and recording alongside brothers Chris and Lorin Rowan as the The Rowan Brothers. Their three albums for Elektra-Asylum featured original songs highlighted by the three siblings soaring harmonies.\n\n\n\nRowan subsequently embarked on a well-received solo career in 1978, releasing such critically acclaimed records as Dustbowl Children (a Woody Guthrie style song cycle about humanity's spirituality in relationship to the earth), Yonder (a record of old-time country songs and Rowan originals in collaboration with ace dobro player, Jerry Douglas) and two extraordinarily fine bluegrass albums, The First Whippoorwill and Bluegrass Boy, as well as High Lonesome Cowboy, a recording of traditional old-time cowboy songs with Don Edwards and guitarist Norman Blake. Rowan's recent releases- Reggaebilly, a wonderful blend of reggae and bluegrass and Quartet, a recording with the phenomenal Tony Rice, coupled with a relentless touring schedule have further endeared Peter Rowan to audiences around the world.\n\n\n\nOn the road, Rowan performs internationally as a solo singer-songwriter, while stateside he plays in three bands: the Peter Rowan Bluegrass Band, a quartet featuring Jody Stecher, Keith Little, and Paul Knight; The Peter Rowan & Tony Rice Quartet; and his rocking band, The Free Mexican Air Force.", "otherInfo": "*Peter Rowan & the Free Mexican Airforce Featuring Los Texmaniacs"}, {"Address": "3736 Florence St, Redwood City, CA 94063", "Artist": "Casey Wickstrom", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8746622.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.186595, 37.47839], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "Genres: Blues-Rock, Acoustic, Acoustic Blues, Slide Blues, singer-songwriter, Looping artist", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freewheel Brewing Company", "moreBioInfo": "Casey Wickstrom is a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist looping artist based in San Jose, California.

She harmonized on Colvin\u2019s Grammy-winning Steady On, on Nanci Griffith\u2019s Lone Star State of Mind and Little Love Affairs, and on four of John Gorka\u2019s albums. She also landed soundtrack credits, singing with Suzanne Vega on Pretty in Pink and with Griffith on The Firm, and several commercial credits as well\u2014including \u201cThe Heartbeat of America\u201d for Chevrolet. She can also be heard on the Greg Brown tribute album Going Driftless (also featuring: Ani DiFranco, Iris Dement, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Gillian Welch, Eliza Gilkyson, and others). She teamed with Dar Williams and Richard Shindell to form the supergroup Cry Cry Cry, the three choosing to celebrate the amazing revitalization in contemporary songwriting. The resulting album, Cry Cry Cry (which The New Yorker dubbed \u201ca collection of lovely harmonizing and pure emotion,\u201d and to which Entertainment Weekly gave an \u201cA\u201d rating), has been an astonishing success in stores and on radio. A national tour of sold-out concerts by the trio served to introduce Lucy\u2019s luminous voice to a new expanse of eager listeners. Lucy\u2019s The Red Thread followed the commercial and critical hit \u201cEvery Single Day\u201d (released on 9/11/2001) and marked Lucy\u2019s tenth year (and fifth album) on Red House Records. The Red Thread\u2019s beautiful production was made evident with harmony vocals by Jonatha Brooke, Richard Shindell, Eliza Gilkyson and John Gorka, production and drums by Ben Wittman (The Story), guitarists Duke Levine (Mary Chapin Carpenter) and Jon Herington (Steely Dan), bass player Zev Katz (Bryan Ferry, Roxy Music, Rosanne Cash), and others. In 2005, Red House re-released her debut album The Tide, re-mastered and with two previously unreleased tracks\u2014Jesse Winchester\u2019s \u201cEverybody Knows But Me\u201d and The Beatles\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve Just Seen a Face.\u201d Lucy\u2019s rising popularity has led to appearances on the CBS Morning Show, NPR\u2019s Weekend and Morning Editions, Mountain Stage, West Coast Live, Acoustic Cafe, and Vin Scelsa\u2019s Idiot\u2019s Delight. Lucy also contributed her story to a unique new book, SOLO: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words, which includes some of the best known women on the music scene today including Ani DiFranco, Shawn Colvin, Sheryl Crow, Jewel, and Sarah McLachlan. She was also featured in Lipshtick, a collection of essays by NPR commentator Gwen Macsai. Released in 2007, Lucy\u2019s album Over the Hills is a collection of songs that explore love and the dark, winding road that leads us there. Her new life as a mother has not hindered her musical life but has enhanced it, deepening the emotional depth of her songwriting. Lucy continues to tour extensively across North America, reminding audiences why she has been hailed as \u201ca truly gifted performer\u2026full of enchanting songs\u201d (The New Yorker). \"New York songwriter Lucy Kaplansky is becoming the troubador laureate of modern city folk.\" - Boston Globe \"Lucy Kaplansky is a truly gifted performer with a bag full of enchanting songs\" -The New Yorker", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1928 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Scott Amendola", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7596193.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.80952], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Free Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Uptown Nightclub!", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Amendola:\nDrummer/Composer/Bandleader/Educator\n\u201cAmendola\u2019s music is consistently engaging, both emotionally and intellectually, the product of a fertile and inventive musical imagination.\u201d Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cIf Scott Amendola didn't exist, the San Francisco music scene would have to invent him.\u201d Derk Richardson, San Francisco Bay Guardian\n\n\u201cAmendola has complete mastery of every piece of his drumset and the ability to create a plethora of sounds using sticks, brushes, mallets, and even his hands.\u201dSteven Raphael, Modern Drummer\n\n\u201c...drummer/signal-treater Scott Amendola is both a tyrant of heavy rhythm and an electric-haired antenna for outworldly messages (not a standard combination).\u201d Greg Burk, LA Weekly\n\nFor Scott Amendola, the drum kit isn\u2019t so much an instrument as a musical portal. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings.

Lead singer Bryan Reynolds\u2019 powerful and moving vocal presence is backed by a powerful band; they will not fail to grab your attention. Oakland\u2019s self titled debut album is NOT an album with vague lyrics with no meaning or just for simple listening. It is a composition of solemn prayers and confessions put to syncopated rhythms and commanding vocals. Images of the grace of God in times of desperation are rendered by the lyrics of songs such as \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you\u201d and \u201cHelp Received,\u201d while \u201cLove is Alive\u201d and other songs are anthems of praise for the love that God has given. \u201cWriting songs is easy,\u201d explains front man Bryan Reynolds. \u201cBut writing about the fears and doubts that go on in a Christian\u2019s heart into a song was a bit more difficult. It\u2019s especially perplexing to write about all the good things of God and to give him glory when those very doubts and fears are present in myself!\u201d Despite the apparent difficulty of staying away from cheesy lyrics and simple chord progressions in order the write more God glorifying music, Oakland\u2019s album will surely not disappoint. Since it's inception in 2009, Oakland has successfully completed two South-East Regional tours and recorded their first full-length album. In the summers of 2010 and 2011 the band set out on these regional tours where they performed at camps, churches, and outreach events. As a band, they had a heart to step down off the stage and serve in the camp kitchen or serve as leaders. Through these ministries, each member of the band developed excellent relationships with students that far surpass the time that they are with them and in many cases these relationships result in discipleship. \"I have been blessed on many occasions to share in the ministry and worship with [Oakland]. These young men are passionate about the word God has laid upon their hearts; they are gifted songwriters and musicians, but above their talents and gifting's they live and breathe to exalt and magnify the name of Jesus.\" \u2013 Sam Kiser, Youth and Young Adults Pastor, Bethesda Ministries, Elizabethtown,KY. In the Fall of 2011, Oakland relocated to Nashville, TN from South Florida, where they have been working on their debut album. Since relocating, the band started to change it\u2019s image and decided it was time for a name change. Changing the name from The Bryan Reynolds Band to Oakland was a process that came about through thinking about all the changes the band has gone through over the past three years. In Genesis 35, God speaks to Jacob and commands him to move with his family (Israel) to Bethel. In obedience, Jacob then goes before his family and tells them to bring their false idols. When they brought them, he took the idols and buried them underneath the oak tree, and moved to Bethel to make sacrifices to God. \u201cWe needed something to really remind us why we moved to Nashville in the first place.\u201d Bass guitar player Jared Ison says. \u201cWe all made sacrifices to pursue this ministry, but at the same time were holding on to false idols of doubt, fear, and insecurity.\u201d Former drummer Addison West Parris explains further, \u201cwe needed to bury anything that wasn\u2019t of God throughout this whole process. We needed to kill our Idols. This name change is a symbol of us doing so.\u201d More than a band; a Christ-centered ministry with a heart to serve, and a passion for good music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1111 O'Farrell Street, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "California Bach Society", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.423286, 37.784249], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "St. Mark's Lutheran Church", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "23 Petaluma Blvd N, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Zane Carney", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8425178.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.640098, 38.233411], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Blues, Songwriter, Jazz, Rock, Folk Rock, Singer, Pop", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Mystic Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Zane Carney is a world-class guitarist, singer, and songwriter, most known for his work with John Mayer, CARNEY, and Broadway's \"Spider Man -Turn Off The Dark.\" Zane's astonishing talents have made him one of the foremost young guitar players in the world with credits that include performing alongside Stevie Wonder, Keith Urban, and Roy Hargrove, appearing on Oprah, Ellen, and David Letterman, opening for U2, Fergie, and The Black Crowes, and working with esteemed artists such as Bono & The Edge, David Foster, and Don Was. Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "243 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Nathan Temby", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8880352.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408656, 37.786085], "Date": "Fri Dec 13 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-13", "Genre": "Genres: Cabaret, Cover Songs, Singer Songwriter, Broadway", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Johnny Foley's Irish House", "moreBioInfo": "Whether he is performing an acoustic set of his introspective and deeply moving originals or entertaining the masses with his high-energy piano bar shows, singer and songwriter Nathan Temby is definitely someone to keep your eye on.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars.

With a process the LA Times' Randall Roberts described as \"drawing a different design within a similar framework,\" the producer/DJ deconstructs and re-orchestrates samples from his respective subjects, bridging overlapping themes of the two musician's classic catalogues. Equally influenced by his Brazilian roots and southern U.S. upbringing, the 28 year old Nashville native's work was featured in Apple's \"What Will Your Verse Be\" series of iPad commercials, called \"brilliant\" by music\u2019s premier aficionado, Questlove, and earned praise from national/global outlets such as The Guardian, Huffington Post, The LA Times, Vulture, NPR, BBC, MTV, BET, REVOLTtv, EBONY,VIBE, XXL, THE SOURCE, OKAYPLAYER, Wax Poetic, Gizmodo and HipHopDX to name a few.\n\n\n\nThe son of renowned Jazz trumpeter, Gary \u201cEl Buho\u201d Gazaway, Amerigo\u2019s thematic documentary-like concept albums uses found interview sound-bites, live performances, and original multi-track stems to help narrate and craft his combined artists' stories. Finding his first success with 2011's Fela Kuti/De La Soul pairing \"Fela Soul,\" the project went on to land on several year-end \"best of\" lists including NPR, Soul Train, and OKAYPLAYER. Following the release in 2012 with \"Bizarre Tribe: A Quest to the Pharcyde\", a concept that layered vocals of The Pharcyde over re-imagined productions sourced from the original Soul, Jazz, and Funk records ATCQ utilized to create their productions, Gazaway would later collaborate with The Pharcyde on their single \"Still Got Love\" and perform with the legendary group at SXSW.\n\n\n\nContinuing the theme of his previous work in 2014, the producer united Brooklyn rapper Yasiin Bey (FKA Mos Def) and soul legend Marvin Gaye for a dream collaboration aptly titled \"Yasiin Gaye\" (side one and side two.) Building the album\u2019s foundation from deconstructed samples of Gaye\u2019s Motown classics, Amerigo re-purposes the instrumentation into new productions with the familiar fervor of the original work. Carefully weaving Bey\u2019s tangled raps and Gaye\u2019s soulful vocals over his new arrangements, Gazaway delivers a quality much closer to an authentic collaboration than a lukewarm \u201cmashup\u201d album. Drawing nearly 20,000 downloads in its first two days of release, the \u201cMaster Modern Soul Match Maker\u201d (Juan Vidal- Vibe Magazine) earned a perfect \u201c5 Star\u201d review from BET, collaborated with New York Magazine cartoonist, Drew Dernavich, for the project's side two cover art, and landed on Billboard's Best Selling Singles Chart with the album's third single, \"You Are Undeniable.\"\n\n\n\nHoning his DJ skills through tours of Europe, Brazil, and the U.S., Gazaway\u2019s dancefloor driving live set features classic breakbeats, original blends, remixes, edits, and mashups of multiple genres including Funk, Soul, Disco, Hip-Hop, Afrobeat, and everything in-between.

His creativity, courage and relentless search for new forms of expression are some of his principal and consistent virtues when it comes to making music. On the dance floor, he is lively, intelligent and sophisticated, with a deep awareness for sound aesthetics. Every session is important to Paco and he sets out to invent and renew every time he steps onto the stage. In 2006 he launched Mindshake, conceived as a platform for the creation and distribution of electronic music. Over the past few years, Mindshake has become one of the most important techno labels in the US and Europe. Also in 2006, Paco founded a club with a fresh concept, Club4, which has established itself as the overwhelming choice for its variety and accessibility in electronic music offerings. Throughout his career Paco has performed at clubs, parties and festivals of great prestige. The list of events in which he has played is endless, and is one where quality is more important than quantity. From Fabric London to WOMB Tokyo, passing through Space NYC, Space Miami, Verboten New York, Watergate Berlin and Electric Brixton London. Meanwhile, S\u00f3nar, Awakenings, Dockyard, ADE, Neopop, BPM, Electric Zoo, Movement Detroit, Time Warp and Tomorrowland are some of the many festivals he has played. From 2012 to 2014 he was resident for Richie Hawtin\u2019s ENTER, appearing not only at Space Ibiza but also in its tour around the world. In 2015 Paco Osuna became part of Music On, joining Marco Carola in residencies at Amnesia Ibiza and the Story club in Miami, as well as the emblematic parties during BPM Mexico. In 2016 he was selected to be ambassador of PLAYdifferently Model1, a distinction also received by Loco Dice, Chris Liebing, Dubfire and, of course, Richie Hawtin. 2016 was also an important year for the Mindshake showcases, in which Paco participated alongside other label producers with tours taking in European and American stages, including events such as the Miami Music Week and ADE Amsterdam. The Mindshake showcases are both an extension of the musical and artistic vision of Paco and a family celebration, where the main goal is to create an unforgettable musical experience. In the studio, Paco Osuna has moulded his own musical signature, coating the purest techno sounds with his characteristic features: depth, darkness and imagination, always accentuated by his creativity and innovation. Proof of that are his releases on labels such as Plus8, Minus, Mood, Spectral and Hommage, plus productions for his own platform Mindshake. With a long career and background, Paco has picked up several prizes for his hard work on and off the stage, receiving the awards for Best Artist, Best Techno DJ, Best Producer and Best Remix from the Vicious Awards and DJ Mag Spain. During 2016 Paco Osuna will extend the journey that has led him be the artist that he is today. This year, his residencies with Music On Ibiza and Miami will continue, while he will also still be focusing his energy on his main project Mindshake, a label that will end this year having published more than 45 works since its conception.

The founding members were schoolmates David Hinds (the primary songwriter as well as the lead singer and guitarist), Basil Gabbidon (guitar), and Ronnie \"Stepper\" McQueen (bass). All of them came from working class West Indian immigrant families, and none had much musical experience. They took some time to improve their technical proficiency, often on Roots inspired material by the Wailers, Burning Spear and several other prominent Jamaican artists. McQueen suggested the group name, after a racehorse, and they soon fleshed out the lineup with drummer Steve \"Grizzly\" Nisbett, keyboardist/vocalist Selwyn \"Bumbo\" Brown, percussionist/vocalist Alphonso \"Fonso\" Martin, and vocalist Michael Riley.\n\nSteel Pulse initially had difficulty finding live gigs, as club owners were reluctant to give them a platform for their \"subversive\" Rastafarian politics. Luckily, the punk movement was opening up new avenues for music all over Britain, and also finding a spiritual kinship with protest reggae. Thus, the group wound up as an opening act for punk and new wave bands like the Clash, the Stranglers, Generation X, the Police, and XTC, and built a broad-based audience in the process. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Steel Pulse developed a theatrical stage show that leavened their social commentary with satirical humor; many of the members dressed in costumes that mocked traditional British archetypes (Riley was a vicar, McQueen a bowler-wearing aristocrat, Martin a coach footman, etc.). The band issued two singles -- \"Kibudu, Mansetta and Abuku\" and \"Nyah Love\" -- on small independent labels, when they then came to the attention of Island Records after opening for Burning Spear.\n\nSteel Pulse's first single for Island was the classic \"Ku Klux Klan,\" which happened to lend itself well to the band's highly visual, costume-heavy concerts. It appeared on their 1978 debut album, Handsworth Revolution, which was soon hailed as a classic of British reggae by many fans and critics, thanks to songs like the title track, \"Macka Splaff,\" \"Prodigal Son,\" and \"Soldiers.\" Riley departed before the follow-up, 1979's Tribute to the Martyrs, which featured other key early singles in \"Sound System\" and \"Babylon Makes the Rules,\" and solidified the band's reputation for uncompromising political ferocity. That reputation went out the window on 1980's Caught You, a more pop-oriented set devoted to dance tracks and lovers rock. By that point, Steel Pulse was keen on trying to crack the American market, and went on tour over Island's objections. Caught You was issued in the States as Reggae Fever, but failed to break the group, and they soon parted ways with Island.\n\nSteel Pulse moved on to Elektra/Asylum, which released an LP version of their headlining set at the 1981 Reggae Sunsplash Festival. Their studio debut was 1982's True Democracy, a generally acclaimed set that balanced bright, accessible production with a return to social consciousness. It became their first charting LP in America, making both the pop and R&B listings. The slicker follow-up, Earth Crisis, was released in 1984 and featured producer Jimmy \"Senyah\" Haynes subbing on guitar and bass for founding members Gabbidon and McQueen, both of whom left the group by the end of the recording sessions. They were replaced by guitarist Carlton Bryan and bassist Alvin Ewen for 1986's Babylon the Bandit, another Haynes-produced effort that ranked as the group's most polished, synth-centered record to date. It featured the powerful \"Not King James Version\" and won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album.\n\nIn 1988, Steel Pulse released State of Emergency, their most explicitly crossover-oriented album yet. They also contributed the track \"Can't Stand It\" to the soundtrack of Spike Lee's classic Do the Right Thing. In 1991, they released another heavily commercial album, the Grammy-nominated Victims, which featured the single \"Taxi Driver.\" Backing up the song's views, Steel Pulse filed a class-action lawsuit against the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging that drivers discriminated against blacks and particularly Rastafarians. Founding member Fonso Martin left that year, reducing Steel Pulse to a core trio of Hinds, Nisbett, and Brown. Their backing band still featured Ewen and was elsewhere anchored by guitarist Clifford \"Moonie\" Pusey, keyboardist Sidney Mills, trumpeter Kevin Batchelor, Saxophonist Jerry Johnson and Trombonist Clark Gayton.\n\nThe 1992 live album Rastafari Centennial marked the beginning of a return to the group's musical roots, and earned another Grammy nomination. The following year, they performed at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration, the first reggae band to appear at such an event. 1994's studio album Vex completed Steel Pulse's re-embrace of classic roots reggae, though it also nodded to contemporary dancehall with several guest toasters and a digital-flavored production. 1997's Rage and Fury continued in a similar vein, and was nominated for a Grammy. In 1999, the group released another collection of live performances, Living Legacy.\n\nFast forward a long seven years since their previous album, Rage and Fury, Steel Pulse would return yet again, this time with African Holocaust, and yet again have their ranks dwindled. Core members David Hinds (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Selwyn Brown (keyboards, backing vocals) are the only ones to remain from the band's original line-up, but they more than hold their own and they're joined by a deep roster of supporting musicians, a list too long to list. As always, the music is what's most important, and on that count, this Steel Pulse lineup indeed makes the mark. Granted, it did take them seven years to get the album out, but still it won a Grammy Awards Nomination for Best Reggae Album of the year. There's really not too much else to say about African Holocaust. Longtime fans will know what to expect. Newcomers should know a few things: above all, Steel Pulse are known for performing well-written, Afrocentric songs that are rebellious without being negative or inflammatory, and though the band membership has changed over the years, the type of songs hasn't, nor has the steady move away from dancehall that was apparent on the band's previous album. the message and music remain true to the band's principles and vision.\n\nSteel Pulse is one of Britain's greatest reggae bands, in terms of creative and commercial success. Steel Pulse started out playing authentic roots reggae with touches of jazz and Latin music, and earned a substantial audience worldwide.

She is a major muse watched by the inspired world, an in categorical performer who collapses time and genre with one hand guided by tradition, while the other hand carves out a shining future. Santigold is neither calm nor mayhem, but from her lungs burst every color in between.\n\nAfter four years of hide and seek in which blogs blew up at the sudden release of any track with her name attached to it, Santigold returns in a moment of global aggression and vulnerability. Honing in on the hyper-media cult of personality, in her unmistakable voice she asks the listener: Into what fantasy do you hurl yourself as you gaze into the glow of your machine? The answer to this question is central to what drives Master of My Make-Believe, her latest work to be released this spring on Atlantic Records.\n\nAs an antidote against self-celebratory status updates in a climate where the focus on fame outweighs a day\u2019s emotions, Master of My Make-Believe summons pop culture zombies back to life. This is sound proof of an artist on a diligent journey, measuring the power of individual mood against social clamor. Sifting through a wondrous wreckage of airplay, upload, and anguish, Santigold\u2019s talent lies in filtering reality through freakdom, to find in desire a timeless spark of raw magic.\n\nAnyone caught referring to Master of My Make-Believe as a sophomore effort is only half right. Though relatively fresh as Santigold, Santi White\u2019s history of writing, production, and performance stretch beyond the century\u2019s flip. Her collaboration with the industry\u2019s most recognized and respected talent is something continuous and wide reaching, making her musical lineage all the much richer. Declared Best Breakthrough Artist by NME in 2008 and Pop Music Vanguard by ASCAP in 2009, the voice that defines Santigold is as complex as the faces that pack a subway car, as intimate and honest as conversation on a weathered stoop.\n\nThrough chopped pianos, the clink of glass bottles, and the peaking blast of motorcycle engines, Master of My Make-Believe accounts for 21st century details of life from the heart\u2019s center to the mind\u2019s periphery. In her pen and in her voice, the breadth of substance presented in Santigold\u2019s newest songs is immediate and complex. There are valleys here wherein the drudge of daily living is met with caution and confronted by mortality, but underneath it all there is the celebration of each person\u2019s power and vision to fight toward what they believe.

The band had been experimenting with grunge for while, incorporating Soundgarden\u2019s \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d into their live shows, and loved the feeling of working with something out of their usual soul-funk-R&B wheelhouse.\n\n\u201cWe were reflecting on how many musicians we\u2019d lost from that era, this scene that inspired so many of us,\u201d says McCarter. \u201cAnd we wanted to honor them.\u201d\n\nAs a playful yet potent tribute to Kurt Cobain, the song builds on a sexy, spacious bass and electric guitar rhythm, building to a blast of horns and a smart, slinky synth line, all topped by McCarter\u2019s powerful falsetto. It only took a couple hours to arrange, but within weeks \u201cHeart Shaped Box\u201d had become one of the most exciting, crowd-pleasing moments in the band\u2019s live show.\n\nPlus, it worked: \u201cIt really did kickstart things,\u201d says Kirchner. \u201cWithin a month we had two more new songs, and we were on our way to a full-length.\u201d\n\nExplorer, out July 6th, is Con Brio\u2019s hotly anticipated sophomore LP, a follow-up to their critically acclaimed 2016 debut Paradise.

Doug\u2019s live band, Emancipator Ensemble, headlined Red Rocks Amphitheater for the first time and made appearances at many music festivals across the globe.\n\nNovember 2017 also marked the release of the much-anticipated new Emancipator album, Baralku, via his own label, Loci Records. Inspired by the astral \u201cisland\u201d some aboriginal societies believe to be our spiritual home after death, Baralku synthesizes downtempo hip-hop beats, world music elements, and field recordings, as well as jazz, folk, and classical influences into a transcendent hybrid of lush, nuanced, and ethereal compositions.\n\n\u201cMusic takes me to places, and each song is a spirit island on which its soul lives infinitely,\u201d says Emancipator of the album\u2019s title and his inspiration. \u201cTo release a song is both a death and a birth at the same time,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe sounds contained in each song have reached the end of their life process. The once shapeshifting collage of expression has been crystallized into a final form, no longer kinetic. Yet it exists in a state of permanent potential energy, waiting to be accessed in the form of music, just as the memory of a departed soul will always have the power to move us.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of Baralku, the Emancipator Ensemble will embark on a 25-date North American tour in early 2018.\n\n\nhttp://www.emancipatormusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Swing", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7037329.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Latin, Tribal, Big Room, Progressive, Rock, Electronic, Minimal, House, Tech", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "\u2022 Graduated from the Prestigious Point Blank DJ School, London as an Advanced and Technical DJ \u2022 Rocking the club spaces and raising the roof under the tag 'DJ SWING' for the last 7 yrs \u2022 Trained by the best DJ in the world \u201cCarl Cox\u201d at Point Blank DJ School, London \u2022 Entered the Guinness Book of World records by playing for 55 hrs (Non-Stop) with 5 other DJs in the World\u2019s longest Dance Party at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi \u2022 Played with International fame DJs like Robert Miles, Vas Floyd, Eddie Lock, Ray Davis, Freaky Disco etc. \u2022 Performed with International bands / artistes like Shaggy, Jamelia, NG Rapper, Boney M, RedNex etc \u2022 Performed with National bands / artistes like Shivamani, Euphoria, Parikrama etc. \u2022 Played for popular public events like Smirnoff Experience, Bacardi Blast, October Beer Festival, and Foam Parties across India. \u2022 Associated with famous personalities of the Fashion Industry, Musicians and Artistes across the globe. http://swingofficial.com", "otherInfo": "Swing Jam w/Olivier Zyngier - 12/14/19"}, {"Address": "Haste & Telegraph, Berkeley, CA", "Artist": "Scott Guberman", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8809008.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-120.038247, 38.828658], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Rock, Rock, Rock \\, Roll, Beyond", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Berkeley Street Festival ", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Guberman performs regularly with Grateful Dead's founding bassist, Phil Lesh.\n\nScott Guberman has become an outstandingly important member of the Bay Area music scene in between his shows with Phil Lesh, appearing most often at Terrapin Crossroads.

Meredith\u2019s 2014 single \u2018Jumpin Beds\u2019 and the rapturous way it was received solidified the path forward for this talented songstress. Those hungry for another dose of Meredith\u2019s lo-fi loveliness rejoiced as the singer released single \u2018Levels\u2019 in the last quarter of 2015 as well as an intricate video accompaniment. The response to \u2018Levels\u2019 was ecstatic with the track receiving airplay on triple j, 200k plays on Spotify and an entry into the Spotify UK Viral 50 charts. The video also received copious amounts of love from rage and the blogosphere. Supporting the likes of Avaberee, Machine Age, Timberwolf and The Once (CAN) in 2015, Meredith surfaced with a brand new live show setup for 2016. In March she released new single \u2018How Could You Believe That\u2019 - a reflection on feeling powerless in supporting a friend who finds themselves stuck in a toxic relationship \u2013 and will release her self-titled debut EP on Friday June 17. With a San Cisco support gig under her belt in 2016 and an EP launch just around the corner, this hugely talented singer/songwriter is fast becoming one of the alternative pop world\u2019s most enthralling new muses.

Over the past 20+ years Mike Tamburo has become well known as a multi-instrumentalist and polymath, performing and recording ecstatic and transcendental music as well as folk, ambient and sometimes unclassifiable sounds. He is also an artist and a film maker. As he worked deeper and deeper with the sound current and his own self healing practices, he discovered the healing power of the gong and other tuned metal instruments (singing bowls, bells, sound plates) as well as the healing power of mantra and toning. In 2008 he met Gallina Tamburo, who was on her own journey of healing. Their shared love of ecstatic music, kundalini yoga, the gong, sound therapy, and sacred chanting set the foundation of their relationship, marriage and eventual musical collaboration. In addition to completing their Kundalini Teacher Training at the mother ashram in Espanola, NM and Yoga For Youth Training with Krishna Kaur they have studied with Gongmasters Don Conreaux and Sotantar. They are also trained in the Peter Hess Method of Sound Massage using Himalayan Singing Bowls for healing. They have also studied with John Beaulieu in his Body Harmonics approach of sound healing with tuning forks.\nThe duo have released 6 CDs together and also run the Sounds Eternal record label that has released many of Mike\u2019s solo recordings. Together, Mike and Gallina have developed their own style of relating to the therapeutic vibrations of the Gong, incorporating ancient wisdom and infusing it with creativity, playfulness and joy. Crown of Eternity offer a unique sonic experience that is as much grounded in tradition as it is groundbreaking. There is an expansive, blissful, ethereal and epic quality to Crown of Eternity\u2019s music. They are truly immersed in vibration.

His concerts and workshops are heart centered, uplifting, sonically multi-dimensional, life affirming experiences that focus on self transformation through conscious listening and breathing. He lives in deep gratitude and joy that his life of music has had meaning and been of use to the world around him. He seeks peace and harmony in his life and hopes to share this peace with others through his music and teachings. Through extensive national tours both solo and with Crown of Eternity, Mike has offered countless workshops, classes, therapy sessions, concerts and retreats and has guided thousands of people to listen deeply, relax, reconnect to themselves and most importantly marvel at the power of sound. Over the past 20+ years Mike Tamburo has become well known as a multi-instrumentalist, music educator, interdisciplinary sound artist, video artist, sound therapist, writer, meditation teacher and avid traveler; sharing over 1800 public and private performances and recording more than 65 albums of ecstatic and transcendental music as well as folk, drone, ambient and sometimes unclassifiable sounds. Early in Tamburo's career he gained notoriety for his string playing (hammered dulcimer, guitar and shahi baaja). In many of his early performances he began to enter into altered states of consciousness and have out of body experiences while performing. In order to understand these experiences he went into years of self study; exploring Kundalini Yoga, energy work, the therapeutic use of sound and how sound effects consciousness, human perception and self healing. His love for long sustained drones, overtones and psychoacoustics led him to working with multiple gongs and other tuned metal instruments (bells, sound plates, singing bowls) as well as exploring the healing power of mantra and toning.

Like other eager beaver politicians-in-training, he went to every political fundraiser under the sun \u2026 but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming, lackluster, loud and un-neighborly. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world \u2013 crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop \u2013 and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the \u201clittle orchestra\u201d Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for progressive causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education and parks.\n\n\u201cPink Martini draws inspiration from the romantic Hollywood musicals of the 1940s or \u201850s \u2026 with a more global perspective. We write a lot of songs \u2026 but we also champion songs like Ernesto Lecuona\u2019s \u201cAndalucia\u201d or \u201cAmado mio\u201d from the Rita Hayworth film \u201cGilda\u201d or \u201cKikuchiyo to mohshimasu (My name is Kikuchiyo)\u201d made famous in the 1960s by the great Japanese group Hiroshi Wada & His Mahina Stars. In that sense we\u2019re a bit like musical archeologists, digging through recordings and scores of years past and rediscovering beautiful songs.\u201d\n\nLauderdale met China Forbes, Pink Martini\u2019s \u201cDiva Next Door\u201d lead vocalist, at Harvard. He was studying history and literature while she was studying English literature and painting. Actually neither of them really studied, they socialized \u2026 and late at night, they would break into the lower common room in their college dormitory and sing arias by Puccini and Verdi \u2013 and the occasional campy Barbara Streisand cover \u2013thus sealing their creative collaboration. Three years after graduating, Lauderdale called Forbes who was living in New York City, where she\u2019d been writing songs and playing guitar in hew own folk-rock project, and asked her to join Pink Martini. They began to write songs together for the band. Their first song \u201cSympathique\u201d \u2013 with the chorus \u201cJe ne veux pas travailler\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want to work\u201d) \u2013 became an overnight sensation in France, and was even nominated for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at France\u2019s Victoires de la Musique Awards.\n\n\u201cBoth China Forbes and I come from multicultural families,\u201d says Lauderdale. \u201cAll of us in Pink Martini have studied different languages as well as different styles of music from different parts of the world. So inevitably, because everyone has participated at some point in the writing or arranging of songs, our repertoire is wildly diverse. At one moment, you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a samba parade in Rio de Janeiro, and in the next moment, you\u2019re in a French music hall of the 1930s or a palazzo in Napoli. It\u2019s a bit like an urban musical travelogue. We\u2019re very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad \u2026 and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent \u2013 through our repertoire and our concerts \u2013 a broader, more inclusive America \u2026 the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world \u2026 comprised of people of every country, every language, every religion.\u201d\n\nPink Martini has twelve musicians performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia and New Zealand and North America. Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with over 25 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center and the BBC Concert Orchestra in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year\u2019s Eve over the past 15 years; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in NYC; the Governor\u2019s Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; and the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia.\n\n\u201cThe overarching goal is to create a cohesive body of beautiful songs with beautiful melodies. And then it all just extends outward from there. Because the interests of the band are so diverse \u2013 two percussionists who spend a lot of time in Brasil; another percussionist who grew up in Cuba; a German speaking trombone player who studied with all the brass section of the Chicago Symphony and likes Miles Davis; an African American singer who studied French and Italian and sings in 14 different; languages; a cellist who speaks Mandarin \u2013 because of this diversity inside the band, there are endless ideas. On a bad day it can just seem all too dizzying. But hopefully in the larger picture, it is a more accurate representation of America in 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cPink Martini represents all that Toronto aspires to \u2013 sophistication, cosmopolitanism, and a type of delight that sometimes involves dressing up and carousing \u2026 with its heterogeneous tastes and facility in languages, the pop orchestra might have sprung from our own diverse metropolis, but hails instead from Portland, Oregon.\u201d -- Toronto Star, March 2008\n\nThe band has collaborated and performed with Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Henri Salvador, Jane Powell, Chavela Vargas, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, DJ Dimitri from Paris, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Hiroshi Wada, DJ Johnny Dynell and several drag queens from New York City, among others.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Kittenhead", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8968163.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Punk, Alternative, Indie", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bottom Of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "Kittenhead the band that is gonna make you love rock n roll again!\nAfter a summer of song writing, Kittenhead played its first live shows in September 2012 in the Pacific Northwest, with a headlining slot at the Comet in Seattle.

Not at gunpoint or anything\u2014the two had never even met\u2014but the effect of hearing the songwriting legend's music for the first time had an equally compelling effect on Luning, who was studying film scoring at the Berklee College of Music in Boston at the time. Now an accomplished artist in his own right, Luning is preparing to release his most dynamic and gripping collection to date, 'Restless,' and he can trace it all back to one fateful night that changed everything.\n\n\"A couple of friends invited me over to share some songs at their apartment, and that was the first time I'd ever really listened to Americana music or folk or country or whatever you want to call it,\" remembers Luning. \"They showed me John Prine, and it just resonated with me so much. I was like, 'Oh my god, this is what I have to do with my life.' I just figured it out in that moment.\"\n\nLuning dropped out of school almost immediately, moved back to his native California, and devoted himself to songwriting and performing. He worked his way up through open mics to large festival performances, piecing together a band to flesh out his songs along the way and hitting the road to tour with a fierce determination. His self-released debut album, 'Just Drop On By,' garnered acclaim from both critics and fellow musicians alike, with country megastar Keith Urban hailing Luning's \"staunch originality.\" Songs from the album landed numerous film and TV placements, most recently on NBC's 'Grimm,' and Luning's reputation for exhilarating live performances earned him dates with luminaries like Jackie Greene, Dave and Phil Alvin, and Elvin Bishop, along with a slew of festival performances up and down the West Coast.\n\nIf 'Just Drop On by' announced the arrival of a promising new talent, 'Restless' delivers on that potential and then some. Recorded under the guidance of engineer/producer Karl Derfler (Tom Waits, Dave Matthews) and with Luning's longtime live bandmates\u2014Ben Dubin (bass & harmonica), Linden Reed (drums), and Dave Sampson (guitar & mandolin)\u2014the album marks a major step forward, both sonically and emotionally.\n\n\"With the first record, I produced and engineered everything myself,\" explains Luning. \"I'd never worked with an outside producer before, so it was nerve-racking going into the studio with Karl for the first time, but it was just a perfect fit. It was like he knew what I wanted in my music before I even did, and he could push my performances where they needed to go and really take my music to another level.\"\n\nLuning and his band set up shop at the stunning Panoramic Studios in Stinson, California, crafting a darker, grittier vibe for the music and exploring a wider palette than ever before. While many of Luning's songs are inspired by the lives and stories of the men and women he's grown up with in California or met on the road, the lyrics are all filtered through his own unique perspective and reflect his remarkable personal journey. Perhaps no track fits that bill more directly than \"Driftin,'\" an infectious road warrior's anthem that find's Luning singing, \"I wanna keep on drifting like a rambling man.\"\n\n\"I had so much fun on tour going from place to place and playing to new people all the time and I got into the rhythm of it all, so when it ended and we came home I wasn't ready to stop,\" he explains. \"We pulled into Ben's house to unload our gear and I said, 'Ben, we're packing up and we're gonna go somewhere tomorrow right? We're gonna keep on going right?'\"\nMuch of the album is uptempo and exuberant\u2014\"Almost Sounds Like Laughing\" is a foot-stomping folk tune with the energy of a runaway train\u2014but Luning shows off his remarkable depth and range on some of the record's more restrained tracks, like the slow-burning \"Brother In Chains\" and delicate \"Gonna Forget About You,\" which finds him pulling his vocals back to an intimate near-whisper that conveys a world of heartache and regret. \"In Hell I Am\" started life as an acoustic blues on a resonator guitar before morphing into a fiery, electric rocker, while \"Bet It All On Black\" takes on a harder, Southern edge, with Luning repeating the mantra, \"Ain't no use in holding back.\"\n\n\"It's essentially about a person who's kind of carefree,\" he says, \"and they know that something might not be the best thing to do, but they're going all in with it anyway. They're just going for it, regardless of the outcome and any repercussions they might face.\"\nIf that sounds familiar, perhaps like the attitude of a man who might risk everything to drop out of school and move across the country to pursue a dream, it's no coincidence. With songs this good, it's a safe bet that a restless soul like David Luning is going to keep on traveling for a long time to come.", "otherInfo": "David Luning (electric)"}, {"Address": "13716 Saratoga Ave, Saratoga, CA 95070", "Artist": "Ryan McKasson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7869345.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.01875, 37.26852], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Sacred Heart Catholic Church, Saratoga", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "23 Petaluma Blvd N, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "The Easy Leaves", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7844769.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.640098, 38.233411], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Western, Americana Country, Honky Tonk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Mystic Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "The Easy Leaves are very top of the Country heap here in San Francisco, headlining and filling big rooms (Great American Music Hall, The Independent, Mystic Theatre), main stage set at last year's Outside Lands Festival (Willie Nelson told them 'We should play together again'!), CMT premieres their videos ...

His father was an actor and folk musician and taught him the basics on guitar. He went to University of Chicago with the intention of becoming a writer, but a different path unfolded and he fell headfirst into the Chicago blues scene. Things started happening fast after Johnny (at that time featuring guest vocalist Jimmy Burns) took a Monday night residency at the Smoke Daddy in Chicago\u2019s Wicker Park neighborhood. They soon became a strong draw, and the atmosphere they generated was so electric that Bob Koester of Delmark Records offered them a contract after hearing just one set.\n\nSince those days, Johnny played the Chicago blues festival many times, toured Europe regularly, and has headlined festivals all over the US. Over the years, he has developed from a blues guitar slinger and local blues hero into a fully fledged singer, harmonica player, a dynamic and engaging bandleader, and a mature, seasoned guitarist.

Next came DENIM TV, whose two albums, Denim TV and Starving Rich, both broke the CMJ Top 100 in college radio airplay upon release, leading to a very successful national tour. In 1991, Sean moved to Los Angeles, where he collaborated with math professor and former Angry Samoan Gregg Turner on Sante Fe, by The Mistaken for the independent label Triple X. This winsome CD garnered some pleasant press and appeared in the Top 35 radio airplay in Holland upon release. 1999 saw the release of 12 by The Mariettas, a powerful punk-pop quartet which included former members of several legendary LA-area groups; such as The Leaving Trains, Baby Lemonade and Arthur Lee and Love. 12 drew great notices in the US, as well as in the United Kingdom, in music magazines such as Luke and Bucketful of Brains. Sean returned to his native Bay Area in 2001. He recorded several new songs acoustically and refined the material for Too Personal, the first solo CD of his career. Sean plays guitars throughout, though two guest musicians do appear on the album. Polly Klemmer, of The Mistaken, plays piano on two tracks. Also, on \"The Answer is In\", Sean is joined on acoustic guitar by his old friend Russ Tolman, solo recording artist and former guitarist of TRUE WEST In 2006 Sean released Seed of Mayhem, featuring members of all of the above mentioned.

Her songs are slow-release works of craft and catharsis that become treasured, lifetime companions for their listeners. As a storyteller, Colvin is both keen and warm-hearted, leavening even the toughest tales with tenderness, empathy, and a searing sense of humor. In the nearly 30 years since the release of her debut album, Colvin has won three GRAMMY Awards, released twelve albums, written a critically acclaimed memoir, maintained a non-stop national and international touring schedule, appeared on countless television and radio programs, had her songs featured in major motion pictures and created a remarkable canon of work.\n\nColvin was born in Vermillion, South Dakota, where she lived until she was eight. A small-town childhood in the university town of Carbondale, IL. drew her to the guitar by the age of 10. She made her first public appearance on campus at the University of Illinois at age 15. By the late 1970\u2019s Colvin was singing in a Western Swing band in Austin, Texas\u2014the city she now calls home. Moving to New York at the decade\u2019s end she remained in the country music field as a member of the Buddy Miller Band where she met producer, guitarist and co-writer John Leventhal. Leventhal inspired Colvin to find her own voice as a songwriter. She began honing her skill and was soon signed to Columbia Records. Her first album, Steady On, produced by Leventhal, won the GRAMMY Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\nColvin continued to win fans and critics with her subsequent releases, Fat City (1992) and Cover Girl (1994). In 1996, she released A Few Small Repairs (1996), which would prove to be her breakthrough. The song \u201cSunny Came Home\u201d gave Colvin a Top 10 hit, a platinum-selling album and two of GRAMMY\u2019s biggest honors: Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nHoliday Songs And Lullabies (1998), recorded while Colvin was eight months pregnant with her daughter Caledonia, followed. Her next studio album, Whole New You (2001) found Colvin examining new motherhood and the responsibilities of family. These Four Walls (2006) was lauded by People Magazine as \u201cthe most self-assured album of her career\u201d and \u201cone for the ages\u201d by the Washington Post. The Austin-American Statesman called it \u201can exquisite portrait of strength and vulnerability.\u201d\n\nShawn Colvin Live (2009), was recorded during a special three-night engagement at San Francisco\u2019s famous jazz club, Yoshi\u2019s. Live captures the beauty and intimacy of Colvin\u2019s performances, showcasing her inimitable voice and matchless guitar stylings. Praised by both critics and fans, the album was honored with a GRAMMY Award nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\nAll Fall Down (2012) was produced by Colvin\u2019s longtime friend and musical cohort Buddy Miller (Patty Griffin, Robert Plant, Lucinda Williams). Recorded in Nashville with a group of stellar musicians, the album features performances by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Jakob Dylan, Bill Frisell, Viktor Krauss, Brian Blade, Stuart Duncan and Julie Miller.\n\nThe release of All Fall Down was simultaneous with that of her William Morrow/Harper Collins\u2013published memoir, Diamond In The Rough. Diamond in the Rough looks back over a rich lifetime of highs and lows with stunning insight and candor. Through its pages we witness the inspiring story of a woman honing her artistry, finding her voice, and making herself whole.\n\nUncovered (2015) is the long-awaited follow up to fan-favorite Cover Girl. Its twelve tunes include masterful interpretations of songs by Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder, Robbie Robertson and Graham Nash \u2013 and more - but in their selection and delivery they are pure Shawn Colvin.\n\nIn June 2016, Shawn Colvin and longtime friend Steve Earle united to release, Colvin & Earle, their acclaimed self-titled duo album. Produced by Buddy Miller, Colvin & Earle beautifully captures the pair\u2019s extraordinary chemistry and is a true standout in careers already filled with pinnacles and masterpieces. The album received high praise from critics \u2013 NPR asserted that the duo \u201cElevated their collaboration to the level of top-flight album-making, bringing seemingly opposing impulses to the process.\u201d\n\nColvin was recognized for her career accomplishments when she was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Trailblazer Award at the 2016 Americana Honors and Awards Show. Presenting her with this prestigious award was Bonnie Raitt. Said Raitt, \u201cShe\u2019s simply one of the best singers I\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 and a truly gifted and deep songwriter and guitarist\u2026 She was groundbreaking when she emerged and continues to inspire me and the legions of fans and other singer/songwriters coming up in her wake\u201d\n\nTo mark the 20th anniversary of A Few Small Repairs, Columbia/Legacy issued a newly-expanded edition of the album. This special edition includes seven rare live performances culled from the Sony Music archives, plus enhanced artwork including newly-written liner notes by Shawn and producer John Leventhal and recently discovered archival photos.\n\nShawn Colvin\u2019s latest release is The Starlighter (Amazon Music), a new album of songs adapted from the children's music book \"Lullabies and Night Songs.\" The Starlighters\u2019s 14 songs are a mix of traditional numbers and children's standards, an elegant and graceful musical offering that resonates with the warmth and tenderness of poignant familial experience and remembrance. The result is an album that captures the magic and mystery of children's lullabies in a moving and timeless musical offering.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Tijuana Panthers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6802808.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Surf Rock, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "www.tijuanapanthers.com", "otherInfo": "Me First and the Gimme Gimmes"}, {"Address": "2209 Broadway St, Redwood City, CA 94063-1641", "Artist": "Fret Not", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/140151.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2293, 37.48637], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "CLUB FOX", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Club Fox welcomes the soulful rock of SMOKIN' SLICE OF MOJO and old-time gospel of FRET NOT."}, {"Address": "114 Montecito Ave, Oakland, CA 94610", "Artist": "Kitka", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8823453.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.260109, 37.811371], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic analogue", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "St. Paul's Episcopal Church", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from the northern parts of a land filled with folklore and fairy tales comes Kitka, a musical duo from Sweden consisting of two people - each with their own unique set of skills and history.\n\nFrida, born and raised in the 90\u2019s.

Her vocal style is unusual, probably because she learned to sing by listening to how folks did it a century ago \u2013 through the medium of cylinders and 78-rpm records. The dominant theme throughout her expansive repertoire, is that, whatever the genre, these are songs she learns from the original sources (records and / or sheet music) which were released between the 1890s and the 1930s. Part of the allure of old time music, indeed any music throughout the history of recorded music, is hearing the original recordings as played and sung by the original performers in their heyday, loving what they\u2019re doing and doing it because it means something to them in that moment, never because of nostalgia, and Meredith brings the same unbridled passion, earnest devotion and candid vitality to all of her music; she has found possibility and joy in the treasures of cultural folklore. \u201cMeredith Axelrod sings and plays guitar as if she really returned to the pre-mic days.

Written and recorded in a cabin in the woods in Michigan, \u201cIn This Game\u201d received rave reviews from blogs and journalists, and was called the \u201cbeginning of a new sound\u201d by PopMatters.\n\nComplicated Animals released their brand new single Show Me on 1/19/18. While creating their new track, Monica da Silva and Chad Alger were greatly inspired by their recent move to Los Angeles, the music of the 80s, a love for lush, dreamy pop songs, and all things David Lynch. The Brazilian American duo say that although their new track encompasses more of an electronic, synth-based feel, the lyrical subject matter was based on organic, human emotion.\n\n\u201cShow Me (that you want me) really struck me as an intense idea for a song,\u201d says vocalist da Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s scary how detached we humans have become. Technology is great, but we\u2019ve got to remember how important human interaction is, and not just go through the motions like zombies. For this song, Chad dug an old synthesizer we had out of the closet. We started stacking sounds and layering vocals. The production came together quickly, and virtually all of the sounds in the track were created using the same synth.\u201d\n\nMonica da Silva's song Back To His Girl is now featured in the movie Lady Bird.

The group toured the gospel circuit. As a teen, Hewett sharpened his crooner skills in a funk band called Lyfe. In 1976, Hewett moved to Los Angeles and formed a group put together by the owners of the historic Maverick\u2019s Flat, called Beverly Hills.\n\nHewett got his mainstream break as the male vocal lead in Shalamar, a centerpiece of Dick Griffey's SOLAR (Sound of Los Angeles Records) label. His tenor voice mixed beautifully with the bright vocals of Jody Watley, the dancing skills of Jeffery Daniels and the writing and production of Leon Sylvers III. The group gave the world feel-good dance favorites The Second Time Around and A Night to Remember, the baby-making classic For the Lover in You, as well as a number of beautiful B-side ballads like You Can Count On Me and Somewhere There\u2019s a Love. When Watley and Daniels left the group in 1983, Hewett continued to lead Mickey Free and Delisa Davis in the reconstituted Shalamar. This version of the group was best known for soundtrack contributions on Footloose and Beverly Hills Cop with Dancing in the Sheets and the Grammy-winning Don\u2019t Get Stopped in Beverly Hills, respectively.\n\nIn the mid-eighties, Howard set out on his solo career releasing I Commit to Love in 1986 on Elektra and from the first single Hewett made magic giving his amorous voice and whimsical lyrics to Stay, I\u2019m For Real and the title track. Most beloved track on this freshman release would be his spiritually grounded Say Amen. This single soared on the Inspirational charts and has enjoyed the status of a modern gospel classic.\n\nSubsequent projects have solidified Hewett\u2019s place in the high ranks of R&B balladeers by writing and collaborating and lending his voice within an intimate group of crooners, including George Duke, Quincy Jones, James Ingram, Anita Baker, Prince and Stanley Clarke. With Elektra, he released Forever and Ever (1988- Once, Twice, Three Times), Howard Hewett (1990- Show Me) and Allegiance (1992- Can We Try Again).\n\nLater work shows increasing authenticity as Hewett rips song lyrics straight from his soul. It\u2019s Time (1994- This Love is Forever), written and produced almost exclusively with long time friend and collaborator Monte Seward, displays all the vulnerability involved in falling and staying in love. In 2001, Hewett released the all inspirational album The Journey, where he shows us that his faith can\u2019t be separated from his heart and soul.\n\nHewett continues to seduce audiences and eardrums as he is constantly touring and intermittently releasing new music.\n\n\u201cOf all the fine vocalists working today, Howard Hewett is one of the finest.\u201d - Babyface", "otherInfo": "Join us for this holiday concert from Howard Hewett with special guests Maxine Jones and Dawn Robinson, formerly of En Vogue.

Produced by 2016 Producer of the Year Grammy-nominee Dave Cobb (Jason Isbell, Chris Stapleton), the album features eleven new songs, including the lead track \u201cSomething Tamed Something Wild,\u201d which premiered yesterday at Rolling Stone and can now be heard/shared via Soundcloud. Of the song, Rolling Stone praises, \u201c\u2026beautifully sums up where she\u2019s been and sets the stage for what\u2019s yet to come\u2026\u2019Something Tamed Something Wild\u2019 and indeed the entire new album finds the songwriter at her most thoughtful and also at times sweetly whimsical, perfectly capturing the buoyant spirit of her early successes and also serving as a reminder that she remains one of the most grounded, sentient songwriters of her generation.\u201d\n\nIn celebration of the release, Carpenter will return to D.C.\u2019s legendary Wolf Trap for a special performance on July 2. Tickets will go on-sale on Saturday, March 19. Additional tour dates to be announced shortly.\nThe Things That We Are Made Of was recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium and Low Country Sound studios during the spring and summer of 2016. In addition to Carpenter (vocals, electric/acoustic guitar), the album features Cobb (electric/acoustic/gut string guitar, percussion, Moog, Mellotron), Annie Clements (bass), Brian Allen (bass), Chris Powell (drums, percussion), Mike Webb (piano, B3 organ, reed organ, Mellotron, Fender Rhodes) and Jimmy Wallace (piano, B3 organ).\n\nOf the album, Carpenter comments, \u201cWorking with Dave felt great from the first day of our sessions. He is always willing to try something new, believes that \u2018yes\u2019 is the only answer, and surrounds himself with wonderfully talented and generous musicians; by the end of the project, I felt as if I was a part of a new family.\u201d\nCobb adds, \u201cI wanted to work with Mary Chapin because very few people can cut with words like she can. She\u2019s an absolute poet and legend. I was so happy to collaborate on this album together.\u201d\n\nOver the course of her acclaimed career, Carpenter has recorded 14 albums and sold over 14 million records. With hits like \u201dPassionate Kisses\u201d and \u201cHe Thinks He\u2019ll Keep Her,\u201d she has won five Grammy Awards (with 15 nominations), two CMA awards, two Academy of Country Music awards for her vocals and is a member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Most recently, in 2014, Carpenter released her acclaimed debut orchestral album, Songs From The Movie. Arranged and co-produced by six-time Grammy winner Vince Mendoza, the record is comprised of ten previously recorded compositions including \u201cBetween Here and Gone\u201d and \u201cCome On Come On.\u201d Since it\u2019s release, Carpenter has performed alongside the New York Philharmonic, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the London Concert Orchestra, the L.A. Philharmonic and the National Symphony Orchestra among many others.\nCiting as inspiration such seminal film composers as Elmer Bernstein and Thomas Newman, and contemporary symphonic composers like Tobias Picker and Morten Lauridsen, Carpenter had long imagined this project but it wasn\u2019t until she had the chance to work with Mendoza that it came to fruition.\n\nThe result reprises ten of Carpenter\u2019s songs in Mendoza\u2019s distinctively beautiful and cinematic arrangements \u2013 thus the album title that gathers them together \u2013 to give the listener the continuum of a film soundtrack, albeit an imaginary one.\n\nThe album was recorded at London\u2019s legendary AIR Studios, with a 63-piece orchestra, and a 15-voice choir. \u201cPart of the challenge of this new musical setting was to find the right approach to singing each song,\u201d Carpenter says. \u201cSinging with an orchestra is very different from singing with a band. I had to learn to ride the enormous wave of sound an orchestra produces but not over sing at the same time. Finding a quiet voice while still conveying strength was the way in.\u201d\n\nFrom \u201cCome On Come On\u201d to \u201cOn And On It Goes\u201d to \u201cI Am A Town\u201d and \u201cGoodnight America,\u201d the record finds this multi-platinum album selling, multi-Grammy winner, two-time CMA Female Vocalist, and member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame still breaking new ground, giving us a record unlike any of her others. \u201cI grew up in a house where film soundtracks and classical music played constantly because my mother loved them so,\u201d Carpenter says, as a way to explain how she came to this project. \u201cRecording at AIR Studios in London was magical and working with Vince as he transformed my songs with his arrangements was an extraordinary artistic experience. I feel so fortunate to have been given this chance to do something so different from what I have done in the past and what I expect to do in the future.\u201d\n\nThat level of excitement and fearless creativity has been a common thread throughout Mary Chapin Carpenter\u2019s two-and-a-half-decade recording career, during which she\u2019s sold more than 13 million records and developed a remarkably loyal and devoted international fan base.\n\nBorn in Princeton, New Jersey, Carpenter began playing guitar and writing songs early in life, and was playing her songs in D.C. clubs before she was out of her teens. Word of Carpenter\u2019s talents eventually reached Nashville, winning her a deal with Columbia Records, which released her 1987 debut album, Hometown Girl.\n\nHer debut disc set the stage for the success of 1989\u2019s State of the Heart and 1990\u2019s Shooting Straight in the Dark, each of which produced four Top 20 hits, including the Grammy-winning smash \u201cDown at the Twist and Shout.\u201d Those releases were followed by the massive commercial breakthrough of 1992\u2019s Come On Come On, which was certified quadruple platinum and yielded no less than seven charting singles.\n\nMore success followed with such albums as the platinum Stones in the Road, A Place in the World, Time* Sex* Love* and Between Here and Gone. Carpenter moved to Rounder/Zo\u00eb in time for 2007\u2019s Grammy-nominated The Calling, which was followed by the seasonally themed Come Darkness Come Light: 12 Songs of Christmas, the Grammy-nominated The Age of Miracles and Ashes and Roses.\n\nAlong the way, Carpenter has won five Grammy Awards, was named the Country Music Association\u2019s Female Vocalist of the Year in 1992 and 1993 and in 2012 was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Her compositions have also been covered by a diverse assortment of artists including Joan Baez, Wynonna Judd, Cyndi Lauper, Trisha Yearwood, Maura O\u2019Connell, Mary Black and Dianne Reeves and has also collaborated, on record and/or on stage, with the likes of Joan Baez, Shawn Colvin, Dolly Parton, the Indigo Girls and Tony Bennett.\n\nFollowing the January 2014 debut of the album with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at the prestigious Celtic Connections Festival in Glasgow, Carpenter will appear as a guest with orchestras in the U.S. and the U.K. throughout 2014.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1984 Bonita Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Bobby Black", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272093, 37.871966], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Back Room Music", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Following a sold-out appearance at The Back Room in March, Steel Guitar Hall of Famer Bobby Black returns with \u201cHawaiian Paradise,\u201d an enchanted evening of Hawaiian steel guitar, hapa-haole classics, and hula dances.

He\u2019s a folksinger in the classic sense: a singer, storyteller, and traveller, with a catalog of songs that bridge the gap between the past and present. On Folksinger Vol. 2, he acts as a modern interpreter of older songs, passing along his own version of the music that came long before him.\n\nSouthern gospel. Railroad songs. Delta blues. Irish fiddle tunes. Appalachian music. Folksinger Vol. 2 makes room for it all. Produced by David Rawlings, the album carries on a rich tradition in folk music: the sharing and swapping of old songs. Long ago, the 11 compositions that appear on Folksinger Vol. 2 were popularized by artists like Leadbelly, Reverend Gary Davis, Furry Lewis, and Bascom Lamar Lunsford. The songs don\u2019t actually belong to those artists, though. They don\u2019t belong to anyone. Instead, they\u2019re part of the folk canon, passed from generation to generation by singers like Watson.\n\nAnd what a singer he is. With a quick vibrato and rich range, he breathes new life into classic songs like \u201cSamson and Delilah,\u201d one of several songs featuring harmonies from gospel quartet the Fairfield Four. He\u2019s a balladeer on \u201cGallows Pole,\u201d whose melancholy melodies are echoed by the slow swells of a four-piece woodwind ensemble, and a bluesman on \u201cWhen My Baby Left Me,\u201d accompanying himself with sparse bursts of slide guitar. \u201cDry Bones\u201d finds him crooning and hollering over a bouncing banjo, while \u201cTake This Hammer\u201d closes the album on a penitent note, with Watson singing to the heavens alongside a congregation of Sunday morning soul singers.\n\nArriving three years after Folksinger Vol. 1 \u2014 his first release since parting ways with the Old Crow Medicine Show, whose platinum-selling music helped jumpstart the 21st century folk revival \u2014 Vol. 2 expands Watson\u2019s sound while consolidating his strengths. Several singers and sidemen make appearances here, including Gillian Welch, the Punch Brothers\u2019 Paul Kowert, and Old Crow bandmate Morgan Jahnig. Even so, Watson has never sounded more commanding, more confident, more connected to the music that inspires him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to prove any point here,\u201d he insists, \u201cand I\u2019m not trying to be a purist. There\u2019s so much beauty in this old music, and it affects me on a deep level. It moves me and inspires me. I heard Leadbelly singing with the Golden Gate Quartet and it sounded fantastic, and I thought, \u2018I want to do that.\u2019 I heard the Grateful Dead doing their version of \u2018On the Road Again,\u2019 and it sounded like a dance party in 1926, and I wanted to do that, too. That\u2019s the whole reason I ever played music in the first place \u2014 because it looked and sounded like it was going to be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nNodding to the past without resurrecting it, Willie Watson turns Folksinger Vol. 2 into something much more than an interpretation of older songs. The album carries on the spirit of a time nearly forgotten. It taps into the rich core of roots music. It furthers the legacy of American folk. And perhaps most importantly, it shows the full range of Willie Watson\u2019s artistry, matching his instrumental and vocal chops with a strong appreciation for the songs that have shaped not only a genre, but an entire country.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4444 Railroad Ave, Pleasanton, CA 94566", "Artist": "Todd Morgan", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8852114.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.873553, 37.661082], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Rock, Blues, Jazz, Funk, Rockabilly", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Firehouse Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Todd Morgan joins Pleasanton\u2019s own trumpeter Jeff Bordes at the Firehouse for his annual holiday show!

Chasing Summer is the third project to date from the R&B impresario born Sir Darryl Farris, and marks his first release under the partnership between Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) and RCA Records. This album follows his 2018 debut LP November \u2014 which also served as his coming-out party on the roster of TDE, a stacked lineup that counts fellow musical luminaries like Kendrick Lamar and SZA in its midst \u2014 SiR is wasting no time in expanding his lovingly languid and sensual sound. Even in the constantly-innovating genre of R&B, SiR has stood head and shoulders above his peers, and Chasing Summer showcases the artistry that elevated him to the position he currently holds.\n\nAfter the release of November, SiR hit the road hard on a back-to-back-to-back tour schedule that saw him reaching audiences far and wide more than ever before. \"We didn't have any time to do anything but perform, shake hands, and kiss babies,\" he marvels. \"We had a lot of fun, and I learned a lot about myself and people in general.\" And the thematic inspiration for Chasing Summer came from those experiences on the road \u2014 SiR's interactions with others around the world, as well as what he learned about himself in the aftermath. \"It's about the duplicity that's my life,\" he explains. \u201cI walk through some of the situations I've encountered and talk about some of the things that have happened to me.\"\n\nTravel is the name of the game here, from the bag tags featured on Chasing Summer's front cover to the passport-styled imagery on the back \u2014 not to mention the album's marking of the latest stop in an artistic journey that SiR's continuing to take. \"It's an evolution,\" he states regarding the album's sound and style. \"I have my own sound that's been locked in for the last five years, but I take a lot of risks from what I'm saying and how I transition from song to song. There's a lot of growth.\"\n\nThere's a yearning at the center of Chasing Summer as well \u2014 the type of internal conflict that all ages relate to, as the seasons change and hearts become more carefree: \"I thought I was gonna find freedom on the road\u2014the freedom to do what I wanted. It's the lifestyle of summer\u2014kids think of being out of school, and adults think of taking vacation and doing what they want. It's the lifestyle they dream of\u2014where they can enjoy life and not have to worry so much about the everyday grind. On the road, I felt like I was chasing summer for sure.\"\n\nWork on Chasing Summer took place over the last four years in SiR's personal studio (\"I'm hands-on with everything\"), with some songs dating well before the auspicious debut that was November. \"We re-cut and re-mixed songs to make everything sound cohesive sonically,\" he explains on the effort to keep things fresh. Along with SiR's deft studio hand, production was contributed from TDE heavy-hitters like Kal Banx, Taebeast and Sounwave, along with notable producers such as Boi-1da, Michael Uzowruru and LordQuest; on the features end, a wide range of music's finest adds some spice to the broth, from Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne to Jill Scott, recent TDE signing Zacari, Sabrina Claudio, Smino and Kadhja Bonet.\n\nLamar features on the opening track and first single \"Hair Down,\" a butter-smooth cut featuring SiR's distinctive vocals that was written on the road with the TDE crew. \"I was having a tough time adjusting to what was going on,\" he explains regarding his mindset behind writing the song. I write as my therapy, and I needed to write a record to instill confidence in myself. I wanted to write a record that I knew the fans could enjoy that also had a message behind it, which is to be comfortable about being yourself.\"\n\nOver the muted squall and knocking drums of \"You Can't Save Me,\" SiR details the type of complicated encounter that inspired much of Chasing Summer: \"I wanted the cake, but I definitely couldn't eat it,\" he laughs while explaining the lyrical inspiration. \"It's about a young man who wants what he can't have. There's a mutual respect there, but also a hint of disappointment and regret about how things turn out. It paints a beautiful picture on both sides.\"\n\nThen there's the aqueous \"Still Blue,\" which features Scott in an artistic reunion years after SiR co-wrote for the R&B icon earlier in his career. \"At first, it was just gonna be an interlude, but everyone loved it so much that we were trying to figure out what to do to extend it,\" he explains. I decided to send her music and let her know I wanted to be part of the project, and she accepted. Her work ethic is crazy. It was an honor to have her pull up and bless this project.\"\n\nAmidst the helping hands, however, Chasing Summer is pure, unadulterated SiR \u2014 a true reflection of where he is in the here and now, as well as an impressive expression of musical and personal reflection. \"A lot of times, artists will say one thing and mean a whole other thing,\" he ruminates. \"On this album, I was just telling my truth. I try to leave things up to interpretation at times, but now I want my fans to know I'm not holding back when it comes to who I am.\" And Chasing Summer proves that continuing to dive into SiR's unique mindset is its own reward.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Zane Carney", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8425178.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Blues, Songwriter, Jazz, Rock, Folk Rock, Singer, Pop", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "Zane Carney is a world-class guitarist, singer, and songwriter, most known for his work with John Mayer, CARNEY, and Broadway's \"Spider Man -Turn Off The Dark.\" Zane's astonishing talents have made him one of the foremost young guitar players in the world with credits that include performing alongside Stevie Wonder, Keith Urban, and Roy Hargrove, appearing on Oprah, Ellen, and David Letterman, opening for U2, Fergie, and The Black Crowes, and working with esteemed artists such as Bono & The Edge, David Foster, and Don Was. Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

Making their presence well-known with heavy footprints and sonically indelible marks are San Jose-based Earth shakers ZED. A sound based on core principles of the blues, heaviness, groove, and feel this San Francisco Bay Area quartet is the genuine article, Ladies & Gentlemen. The sound is as organic as it is raw. No bell bottoms, wizard sleeves, or hip huggers for this crew. It\u2019s a barrage of head-bobbing, air-guitaring, hip-shaking, blues-driven rock as delivered by the bastards of rock & roll. With equal appeal to the fuzz-box mercenaries, stoner-rockers safety meeting in a \u201974 Chevy van, and horns-thrusting metalheads pressed against the stage, this band refuses to conform or brandish a manufactured label. Showing the maturity and confidence to explore the full gamut of their influences and what inspires them internally, ZED is set to offer their third full-length album \u201cTrouble In Eden\u201d with an August 26th release date on Ripple Music. \u201cTrouble In Eden\u201d is a literal collection of blood, sweat, and tears crafted together with raw, personal, relative lyrical content. Tales touching on religious-fueled tragedy, societal reflection, struggles with mental anguish, loss, and perseverance, this album is one for all to relate to. Drop the needle, push play, crank the knob, push the volume high and prepare to be intoxicated by the potion ZED is offering. \u2013 Dylan Dominguez-Waltz Blasting onto the San Francisco Bay Area rock scene in 2007, ZED quickly made a name for themselves with their crushing live shows and incessant grooves. Having played together in various projects since 1998, including releasing an album with the band Stitch for Prosthetic/Metal Blade Records, Guitarist/Vocalist Peter Sattari, drummer Rich Harris and bassist Mark Aceves joined up with guitar wizard Greg Lopes to create a sound that was uniquely their own, a sound whose sole purpose was to rock, with no concern for genres, labels, classifications or rules. Drawing from their varied influences ranging from classic \u201970s rock, punk/hardcore, metal and old school funk, ZED writes music that grabs you, throws you around and grooves you all at once. The band has been likened to \u201ca pissed off Led Zeppelin with Chris Cornell meets Ian Astbury on vocals,\u201d ZED writes songs that linger in your head long after you listen to them. ZED independently released their sophomore album Desperation Blues in May of 2013, which garnered critical acclaim as well as charting on CMJ throughout the summer. Supporting the album up and down the west coast, ZED has played consistently through the fall of 2014 when they began focusing on writing their follow up to Desperation Blues, Trouble In Eden, which is also their debut for Ripple Music. ZED is excited and proud to be a part of the Ripple Music family and look forward to making heads bob and asses shake in 2016 and beyond. ZED is Heavy. ZED is Heavier.

So it\u2019s testimony to their craft to say that Gravity The Seducer, the fifth album from the electro-pop provocateurs, is vintage Ladytron \u2014 because, like each of the four preceding albums, it\u2019s not quite like anything the quartet has done before. Gravity The Seducer (out Sept. 12 in the UK and Sept. 13 in the US) comes on the heels of March\u2019s career-spanning retrospective, Best Of Ladytron: 00-10 and represents a remarkable evolution in the evocative yet precise pop fashioned by Daniel Hunt and bandmates Reuben Wu, Helen Marnie and Mira Aroyo. The new album finds the foursome framing the indelible vocal melodies of twin sirens Aroyo and Marnie with painterly soundscapes that shape-shift like cloud formations above the narratives\u2019 stark, vivid imagery. Hunt jokingly calls this metamorphosis of Ladytron\u2019s sound \u201cbaroque \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d but whatever the term, it\u2019s dreamy. Gravity The Seducer has emerged as the quartet\u2019s most cinematic work to date. \u201cThere is a strong lyrical thread of playful illusionary imagery of dreamlike scenarios and surreal landscapes that runs through the new album,\u201d Aroyo says. \u201cI think it\u2019s our most coherent, in terms of moods and themes\u201d But that wasn\u2019t necessarily the intent when Ladytron convened in the Kent countryside during the summer of 2010 to record the album with co-producer Barny Barnicott, who worked on Ladytron's own Witching Hour. \u201cWhen we began there was quite a bit of mischief involved, but often the things that start that way end as defining moments,\u201d Hunt says. That sensibility is embodied by the first track (and lead single) \u201cWhite Elephant,\u201d a bouquet of keys, harpsichord and strings that features Marnie\u2019s satiny vocals. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s the seed of the record,\u201d Hunt says. And, grouped with the ensuing songs, the insistent, catchy \u201cMirage\u201d and the ethereal, foreboding \u201cWhite Gold,\u201d it speaks to Gravity The Seducer\u2019s most formidable quality: a work whose sonic strata match its layers of meaning. There is a dramatic arc that holds the album together \u2013 musically, lyrically and thematically. \u201cScenes that are set up in \u2018Mirage\u2019 return and reflect in \u2018Melting Ice.\u2019 A few of the songs, such as \u2018Moon Palace,\u2019 takes the listener on a Lynchean journey, where as \u2018Ambulances\u2019 takes us into darker waters,\u201d says Aroyo. The album\u2019s title comes from a track later in the album, \u201c90 Degrees,\u201d another of Gravity The Seducer\u2019s defining moments, a desert-sky hallucination.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3140 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Corazon Serrano", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/236466.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419282, 37.747238], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Latin", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Roccapulco", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Rock Ko Fol", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.463777, 37.783225], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Neck Of the Woods", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rock Ko Fol at Neck of the Woods"}, {"Address": "1748 El Camino Real, San Carlos, CA 94070", "Artist": "Halamay Entertainment", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9491557.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.245361, 37.494091], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Office Bar & Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Halamay Entertainment LLC\nEntertainment Booking Agent: Let Halamay Entertainment help you find the talent for your next event, festival, club, private party & corporate event!\nwww.halamayentertainment.com", "otherInfo": "BAYFIRE\nwww.bayfireband.com\nRock/Soul/Funk"}, {"Address": "456 Castro, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Hard", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8689754.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.435431, 37.761602], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Hdm Hard Dance Music, Hard Rock, All Forms Of Tough Music", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Q Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Denim, sweet riffs, and leg kicks.\n\nDaniel Sowards\nCody Balaschak\nThomas Sweat\nBrady Gomillion", "otherInfo": "\"Hard\" w/ DJ Haute Toddy"}, {"Address": "1453 Webster St, Alameda, CA 94501", "Artist": "Mother & The Boards", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8829955.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.277118, 37.772994], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fireside Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Mother & the Boards is a fierce blend of folk, funk and experimental rock with a message to incite and inspire you.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "2925 Woodside Rd, Woodside, CA 94062", "Artist": "Dutch Uncle", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8446138.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.250378, 37.428942], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Classic Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Pioneer Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "The members of Dutch Uncle have been playing 1970\u2019s classic rock for most of their lives and have perfected the sound and feel of this incredible era of music.

Like other eager beaver politicians-in-training, he went to every political fundraiser under the sun \u2026 but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming, lackluster, loud and un-neighborly. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world \u2013 crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop \u2013 and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the \u201clittle orchestra\u201d Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for progressive causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education and parks.\n\n\u201cPink Martini draws inspiration from the romantic Hollywood musicals of the 1940s or \u201850s \u2026 with a more global perspective. We write a lot of songs \u2026 but we also champion songs like Ernesto Lecuona\u2019s \u201cAndalucia\u201d or \u201cAmado mio\u201d from the Rita Hayworth film \u201cGilda\u201d or \u201cKikuchiyo to mohshimasu (My name is Kikuchiyo)\u201d made famous in the 1960s by the great Japanese group Hiroshi Wada & His Mahina Stars. In that sense we\u2019re a bit like musical archeologists, digging through recordings and scores of years past and rediscovering beautiful songs.\u201d\n\nLauderdale met China Forbes, Pink Martini\u2019s \u201cDiva Next Door\u201d lead vocalist, at Harvard. He was studying history and literature while she was studying English literature and painting. Actually neither of them really studied, they socialized \u2026 and late at night, they would break into the lower common room in their college dormitory and sing arias by Puccini and Verdi \u2013 and the occasional campy Barbara Streisand cover \u2013thus sealing their creative collaboration. Three years after graduating, Lauderdale called Forbes who was living in New York City, where she\u2019d been writing songs and playing guitar in hew own folk-rock project, and asked her to join Pink Martini. They began to write songs together for the band. Their first song \u201cSympathique\u201d \u2013 with the chorus \u201cJe ne veux pas travailler\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want to work\u201d) \u2013 became an overnight sensation in France, and was even nominated for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at France\u2019s Victoires de la Musique Awards.\n\n\u201cBoth China Forbes and I come from multicultural families,\u201d says Lauderdale. \u201cAll of us in Pink Martini have studied different languages as well as different styles of music from different parts of the world. So inevitably, because everyone has participated at some point in the writing or arranging of songs, our repertoire is wildly diverse. At one moment, you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a samba parade in Rio de Janeiro, and in the next moment, you\u2019re in a French music hall of the 1930s or a palazzo in Napoli. It\u2019s a bit like an urban musical travelogue. We\u2019re very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad \u2026 and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent \u2013 through our repertoire and our concerts \u2013 a broader, more inclusive America \u2026 the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world \u2026 comprised of people of every country, every language, every religion.\u201d\n\nPink Martini has twelve musicians performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia and New Zealand and North America. Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with over 25 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center and the BBC Concert Orchestra in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year\u2019s Eve over the past 15 years; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in NYC; the Governor\u2019s Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; and the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia.\n\n\u201cThe overarching goal is to create a cohesive body of beautiful songs with beautiful melodies. And then it all just extends outward from there. Because the interests of the band are so diverse \u2013 two percussionists who spend a lot of time in Brasil; another percussionist who grew up in Cuba; a German speaking trombone player who studied with all the brass section of the Chicago Symphony and likes Miles Davis; an African American singer who studied French and Italian and sings in 14 different; languages; a cellist who speaks Mandarin \u2013 because of this diversity inside the band, there are endless ideas. On a bad day it can just seem all too dizzying. But hopefully in the larger picture, it is a more accurate representation of America in 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cPink Martini represents all that Toronto aspires to \u2013 sophistication, cosmopolitanism, and a type of delight that sometimes involves dressing up and carousing \u2026 with its heterogeneous tastes and facility in languages, the pop orchestra might have sprung from our own diverse metropolis, but hails instead from Portland, Oregon.\u201d -- Toronto Star, March 2008\n\nThe band has collaborated and performed with Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Henri Salvador, Jane Powell, Chavela Vargas, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, DJ Dimitri from Paris, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Hiroshi Wada, DJ Johnny Dynell and several drag queens from New York City, among others.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "915 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Nikki Glaser", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9078320.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414334, 37.802895], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "9:45 PM", "Venue": "Cobb's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Stand up comedian.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "424 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Hella Tight", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.429362, 37.772531], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Underground SF", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Hell'a Tight!\" w/ Lindsay Slowhands"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "George Lopez", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7984057.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Sat Dec 14 2019", "EventDate": "2019-12-14", "Genre": "Genres: stand up comedy , comedy, Other", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "George Lopez\u2019s multi-faceted career encompasses television, film, standup comedy and late-night television.

With their original tracks this year seemingly ubiquitous across Beatport charts and clubland alike, their rise to success has been swift and unrepentant. Staying current whilst building year-on-year in today's music climate takes diversity, focus and raw talent, something that has earned Prok & Fitch the right to join a prestigious list of electronic music household names hailing from the UK's hedonistic city of Brighton. 2015 was a standout year for the pair, culminating in being crowned one of the top selling Tech House acts on the infamous Beatport DJ store at this years Amsterdam Dance Event, following 4 consecutive Top Ten releases. Support has risen rapidly, with regular coverage across Radio one's full spectrum of dance shows; notably Pete Tong, Annie Mac and Danny Howard airing pretty much everything that comes from their Brighton studio, and DJ\u2019s like Nic Fanciulli, Carl Cox, Joris Voorn, Loco Dice, Joseph Capriati, Hot Since 82, Mark Knight & more all professing to heavy rotation of their addictive club cuts in their sets. This hype and consistency has earned them the respect to grace some of the finest Dancefloors and festivals in the world including Space Ibiza, Sankeys, Amnesia, Ministry of Sound, Spy Bar Chicago and Ultra Music Festival, EDC, Sunburn, BPM Mexico and Sensation White. Their journey began as 2 vinyl junkies crate digging for hidden house gems, they share a mutual love of house music that has spawned the infectious trademark groove they've become so renowned for. Their debut production 'Outro Lugar' was picked up by Roger Sanchez's legendary Stealth imprint and branded an Ibiza weapon 2 summers running. That barged the flood gates open to a wave of triumphant remixes: notably Cevin Fisher's classic 'Burning up' and Golden Girls Kinetic, both quickly securing dance floor anthem status the world over, and racking them up credible list of collaborations and remixes which includes the likes of Green Velvet, Ben Westbeach, Moby, Dosem, Todd Terry, Roger Sanchez, and Mark Knight. Meanwhile their explosive studio output has generated yet more demand for forthcoming EP's on heavyweight labels Suara, Relief, Lapsus, Stereo Recordings and they're only just scratching the surface. Working their magic with Mark Knight in the studio and mixing the Toolroom live albums has made them favourites among the label die hards selling out their events worldwide.
