With an atmosphere treading the periphery of pop, the duo\u2019s tangible vocal presence overlays hypnotic electro pulsations in a combination that teases out details of last night\u2019s otherworldly dreams and tempts the waking state to return to its astral analog.\n\nNot quite definable by conventional genres, their avant-garde sensibilities will appeal to an audience seeking a respite from the pedestrian daily grind and typical expectations. There\u2019s an enchanting quality that pervades the work of this singing and songwriting combo. Their lyrics explore themes of love and desire; understanding oneself and one another beyond surface qualities; and questioning the status quo. With every track, they\u2019re suggesting we take another, closer look, because what we think we see and hear just might deserve inspection.\n\nWhile it remains unclear where these two have been, it\u2019s evident enough that they\u2019re here now. She triggering a MIDI mixing board, he on guitar, their vocals intertwine with a shadowy fluidity that invokes notions of another time; perhaps the middle of next week. They sense you wondering what you\u2019re doing then, and invite you back to the present with a wink.\n\nA tale of two spirits unravels curiously from the seams of F I N K E L\u2019s new singles. Their ethereal synthetic textures and rich vocal harmonies produce an aesthetic that grabs attention and gives it a nudge. The result somehow distills the mood of a strange day\u2019s fleeting moments into a potent, lingering hex.

Her work is reflective of transitions, the wilderness, and its navigation. Sometimes she plays banjo, other times acoustic guitar. Often, she plays a Telecaster fronting her band, The Home Team, featuring pedal steel (Tim Marcus), drums (Nick Cobbett), bass (Oscar Westesson), and various other Bay Area musicians.\nDuring her ten years in San Francisco, McFarling has released five independent recordings: studio albums, Distractible Child (2010) and Ridgeline (2013), an EP of cover songs, Others (2013), and two live albums, Live at Pirate Ship Laguna (2009) and Live at Eddie\u2019s Attic (2011). She has toured behind her own projects as well as performing with bands like Y La Bamba and Goodnight Texas, and is one-third of the all-female folk trio Glittersnatch with Megan Keely and Wolf Larsen. Over the years, McFarling has shared the stage with artists such as Shovels and Rope, Sean Hayes, Chris Pureka, Jolie Holland, and has made a home for herself in the San Francisco music community.\nWater Dog, McFarling\u2019s latest release, is her most intimate and folk-leaning record to date. She recorded the album in seasonal segments of 2016. The songs were first demoed with Allen Rothschild in his bedroom in Asheville, NC, where the creaks of his wood floor and the sounds of summer winding down made their way onto the recordings through open windows and live takes.The demos became the foundation of the record, and McFarling took them back to San Francisco, where Avi Vinocur of Goodnight Texas produced and engineered the majority of the record at his home in the Sunset District. \u201cRecording at Avi\u2019s house gave us the time to let the songs breathe and evolve.\u201d McFarling said of the process. \u201cIt gave us space to make decisions at our own pace. I\u2019ve never made a record like that, and it was a really special time. These songs were written in quiet spaces that were lived in. It made sense to record them in that way.\u201d\nThe album is a reflection on inward motion; on the way that water and its movement dominates our lives and bodies. It\u2019s about love, trust, and how we come to know the things we know. Above all, it\u2019s about the cycles of nature that have the power to be both grounding and destructive. \u201cWhile I was writing these songs, I was thinking a lot about family, stability, and love; and I was simultaneously starting to spend more time in and around the ocean. I was getting in the water a lot, and it opened a conversation about the nature of flow; learning to move with changes, instead of against them.\u201d\nIn addition to producing, Vinocur also plays on most of Water Dog and his work is prominent on signature tracks, like \u201cBoth.\u201d \u201cThat song was totally different when I brought it in. Avi simplified the groove, and made it more compelling.\u201d says McFarling. Vinocur also helped complete the writing of \u201cCaney Fork Overlook,\u201d one of the record\u2019s more classic country tunes. \u201cThat song had been half written for years. I wrote it in my van while on a road trip on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it was one of those songs that I never had expectations for. I wasn\u2019t sure it would be on the record. Avi helped get it to a place where it shines.\u201d In other more stripped down songs, McFarling often played live in one take. \u201cThe Storms are Getting Stronger,\u201d \u201cSpring Clean\u201d, and \u201cBox\u201d are songs that have been played in many different arrangements, mostly upbeat with a full band. For the recordings, I wanted them to go back to what they were when they were first written. Simple, quiet folk songs.\u201d\nAlthough Vinocur and McFarling play the bulk of the instrumentation on the record, they also tapped several trusted Bay Area musicians to explore additional layers of sonic texture. Water Dog features Tim Marcus on pedal steel and dobro, Graham Patzner on fiddle, Andrew Laubacher on percussion, Andrew Brennan on guitars, Oscar Westesson on upright bass, and John Elliott on piano. Austin-based band Whiskey Shivers also makes an appearance singing backup vocals on \u201cCaney Fork Overlook.\u201d\nWater Dog is a first for McFarling in many ways. It is the first record she has made without a band, the first time she approached recording without a deadline, and the first time she has explored stripped down instrumentation. \u201cFrom the beginning, the idea was always to let the songs speak for themselves and try not to get in the way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "General Admission."}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Angie Stone ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8676911.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "R&b, Soul, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "Angie Stone (born Angela Laverne Brown in January 30, 1961, in Columbia, South Carolina) is a Grammy Award-nominated American R&B, hip-hop, and neo-soul singer and actress. Stone's music possesses a clear old school soul music influence, and her singing vocals recall those of Aretha Franklin.\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, Stone (as 'Angie B'), was a member of The Sequence, the first major female hip-hop group. They had a hit in 1980 with \"Funk You Up\". She then worked with Mantronix, before teaming up and performing vocals and saxophone for Lenny Kravitz.\n\n\nAngie Stone emerged during the 1990's as part of hip-hop/R&B trio Vertical Hold which released the popular single \"Seems You're Much Too Busy\" as well as two albums: A Matter of Time (June 1993) and Head First (1995).\n\nIn 1996, she teamed up with Gerry Devaux (Lenny Kravitz's brother) and together with Charlie Mole they formed Devox. One album received a Japanese-only release including Stone-penned or co-written material.\n\nAngie Stone shared song-writing credits on D'Angelo's first two studio album's (1995 - Brown Sugar and 2000 - Voodoo) as well as providing backing vocals on tour with him.\n\nShe released her first solo album, Black Diamond, released on 28 September 1999 via Arista Records. She has since also released, via Clive Davis' J Records, Mahogany Soul on October 16, 2001 and Stone Love on July 6, 2004.\n\nMuch of Angie Stone's solo material has a significant hip-hop influence and features notable samples. For example, her first solo single, 1999's \"No More Rain (In This Cloud)\" samples Gladys Knight & The Pips' 1972 \"Neither One Of Us (Want To Be The First To Say Goodbye)\", and 2002 \"Wish I Didn't Miss You\" samples The O'Jays' 1972 \"Back Stabbers\".\n\nAngie Stone sings the theme song for the UPN sitcom Girlfriends.\nShe has two children, a daughter and a son. The son is the child of neo-soul singer D'Angelo, whom she dated during the 1990's.\n\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.angiestoneonline.net", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Angie Stone"}, {"Address": "3223 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Pure Hex ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9495237.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419787, 37.745082], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Alternative, Rock, Shoegaze", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Knockout", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "6780 Depot St, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "The Musers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8182687.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.821304, 38.403181], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Sebastopol, California", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Fern Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Free Range folk from Sonoma County\nThe Musers are Anita Bear Sandwina, and Megan McLaughlin both Multi-instrumentalists and award winning song-writers, accompanied by Tom Kuhn on stand up Bass.

She is a passionate artist who puts herself wholeheartedly into everything, and she always smashes it\u201d\n- Declan Byrne to Richard Kingsmill for the Triple J 2019\n\nLife-changing serendipity happens only to a chosen few, and that moment took musician-artist Deena Lynch by surprise while playing an Iggy Pop tribute night in her native Brisbane, Australia. After witnessing the unhinged performance of a guy emulating Iggy, she knew she had to up her game. \u201cSo, I cracked down two tequila shots,\u201d she recalls, and then transformed into a bona-fide banshee. \u201cEverything I ever suppressed came spilling out. My shame and inhibitions broke down. I wasn\u2019t afraid.\u201d After that primal performance, she earned the nickname-turned-stage name Jaguar Jonze.\n\nSigned to Nettwerk Records, Jaguar Jonze has released \u201cYou Got Left Behind,\u201d \u201cBeijing Baby,\u201d and \u201cKill Me With Your Love\u201d from her 2020 debut EP. At home in Australia, Jaguar Jonze has garnered the attention of The Music, Fashion Journal, Industry Observer and Tone Deaf, who writes \"to sum up the creative explosion that is Deena Lynch into a neat little elevator pitch would have even the most qualified of journalists in tears.\" Jaguar Jonze was named by Cool Accidents as an \u201cArtist To Watch\u201d for BIGSOUND 2019 and was also named in Richard Kingsmill\u2019s (Triple J) \u201cTop 5 Artists from BIGSOUND 2019.\u201d Deena is also a Triple J \u201cUnearthed Feature Artist,\u201d and made her performance debut on \u201cLike A Version\u201d for a cover of Nirvana\u2019s \u201cHeart-Shaped Box,\u201d alongside friends Hermitude. Jaguar Jonze also competed in Eurovision Australia Decides 2020 with her own original song \u201cRabbit Hole.\u201d Abroad, after features on Spotify and Apple Music playlists, FLAUNT Magazine deemed her \u201cnothing short of a manifold visionary.\u201d\n\nJaguar Jonze\u2019s music is multi-dimensional, representing her multicultural roots with her Taiwanese mom and her Australian Dad. Ultimately, Jaguar Jonze\u2014and its adjacent projects, her narrative illustration project Spectator Jonze and her gender-subverting photography project Dusky Jonze\u2014would become powerful ways in which Deena could process her most intimate vulnerabilities and traumas, while also using it to empower those around her to do the same. Her art in all facets, whether it be her music, visual art or photography is a logical extension of these vulnerabilities with each project mining depths of her personality.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything without meaning,\u201d she says of her visual artwork via Spectator Jonze. Through bold pop art that dabbles in surrealism, she destigmatizes mental-health issues by interviewing her subjects before drawing them. Deena\u2019s 50th portrait came after a year into the project confronted her own PTSD stemming from her unstable, unsafe childhood. \u201cI realized when I stepped out of hiding, I could actually move forward, feel less isolated. I want other people to unburden themselves from the wasted extra energy spent pretending and hiding.\u201d Sometimes she finds her subjects; other times, they find her. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl in the States; she\u2019s still one of my favorite drawings. She reached out to me, having come to terms with her psychosis, depression and anxiety. The level of awareness and openness she had really moved me because I was oblivious to the stigma I still held over the mental illnesses I hadn\u2019t yet been exposed to,\u201d Deena says. \u201cWe still have this pen pal relationship with each other. We\u2019ve never met in person, but I think she\u2019s one of the biggest supports in my everyday life.\u201d\n\nDusky Jonze, Deena\u2019s most recent endeavor uses photography to subvert gender roles and highlight toxic masculinity through intimate portraits. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about toxic masculinity enough. So, I thought it\u2019d be funny to just shoot male photographers,\u201d she says of the evocative nude portraits. \u201cAnd they were open to it. They\u2019d say, \u2019You know what? This makes me a better photographer.\u2019\u201d Consequently, the photo project has grown and become a more fluid effort to undo insecurities and taboos of both the male and female body, within the engendered eye of the photographer. As dramatic as the photos can be, they can also be quite funny. For example, when Deena obscures male genitalia with a banana. \u201cI wanted it to be crass and crude.

JEFF The Brotherhood embody and exemplify on their Warner Bros. Records debut LP, Hypnotic Nights. Brothers Jake and Jamin Orrall have been playing together since they were little kids and formed the group when they were in high school. The boys grew up with a voracious appetite for any music they could get their hands on. The band incorporates a DIY ethos in everything they do, including their raucous live shows. JEFF have been touring tirelessly for the past 10 years, playing any and all conceivable venues\u2014from basements and backyard sheds to Bonnaroo and The Bowery Ballroom. The duo clocked in over 400 shows in the past two years alone and have shared bills with Best Coast, Fucked Up, Pentagram, The Kills, The Greenhornes and more. When it comes to creating their desired sound, JEFF believes that less is more. This idea is reflected in Jake\u2019s decision to play a guitar with only three strings. Jake explains, \u201cWhen we started the band, I didn\u2019t know how to play guitar,\" he remembers, \u201cI thought, in order to teach myself, it would be easier to play if I simplified it. I started with two strings, but you can\u2019t really play any chords that way, so I added a third string [which added] this interesting limitation that forced me to create my own style and approach to the instrument.\u201d These musical intricacies all come together on Hypnotic Nights, which was co-produced by Jake, Jamin and musician/producer Dan Auerbach (Dr. John, The Ettes). The album was recorded in Nashville at Dan\u2019s Easy Eye Sound Studio in early 2012. JEFF entered the studio focused and prepared with a clear vision for the album they wanted to make, completing Hypnotic Nights in only one week. For any other band, completing an album in seven days would seem like a challenging feat, but for JEFF those seven days felt like a luxury when compared to the amount of time spent on making 2009\u2019s Heavy Days and 2011\u2019s We are The Champions, which were released on the band\u2019s own label Infinity Cat Recordings. Each took only three days to make. \u201cWe\u2019ve never worked with a producer before, so this was the first time we\u2019d ever had any outside input,\u201d says Jamin. \u201cIt was Dan\u2019s first co-production, too, and it really worked. He just hung out, let us do our thing and helped when we needed it.\u201d Adds Jake, \u201cWe write songs without anyone else in mind, so Dan brought in this idea of, \u2018Well, you guys do what you do and I\u2019ll present it so everyone else will understand.\u2019\u201d The result is Hypnotic Nights, an album that uniquely blends elements of indie, punk, garage, and psychedelic rock. The first single, \u201cSixpack,\u201d is a fuzzed-out rocker driven by reverb-heavy riffs and propulsive drumbeats. Songs like \u201cLeave Me Out\u201d and \u201cDark Energy\u201d venture into new musical territory for JEFF, but the band isn\u2019t afraid of experimentation. After all, it\u2019s this imagination and ingenuity that makes Dan Auerbach plainly say, \u201cJEFF The Brotherhood are the next big name in showbiz.\u201d In the end, Jake and Jamin just want to write great songs, play great shows and inspire fans to rock along with them. For JEFF The Brotherhood, blood is thicker than water\u2014and music runs through the band\u2019s veins.

After an extensive touring career of over 20 years with luminaries like Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Al Jarreau, Stan Getz, David Sanborn, Joe Sample, Cassandra Wilson, Clark Terry, Dianne Reeves and more, she returned to her hometown where she was appointed professor at her alma mater, Berklee College of Music. Terri Lyne also received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 2003.\n\nAfter studying under full scholarship at Berklee, with the encouragement of her mentor, Jack DeJohnette, Carrington moved to New York in 1983. For 5 years she was a much in-demand musician, working with James Moody, Lester Bowie, Pharoah Sanders, and others. In the late \u201880s she relocated to Los Angeles, where she gained recognition on late night TV as the house drummer for the Arsenio Hall Show, then again in the late \u201890s as the drummer on the Quincy Jones late night TV show, VIBE, hosted by Sinbad.\n\nIn 1989, Carrington released a GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated debut CD on Verve entitled Real Life Story, which featured Carlos Santana, Grover Washington Jr., Wayne Shorter, Patrice Rushen, Gerald Albright, John Scofield, Greg Osby, and Hiram Bullock. Other solo CDs include 2002\u2019s Jazz is a Spirit, which features Herbie Hancock, Gary Thomas, Wallace Roney, Terence Blanchard, Kevin Eubanks, and Bob Hurst, and 2004\u2019s Structure, a cooperative group which features Adam Rogers, Jimmy Haslip and Greg Osby. Both CDs were released on the Europe-based ACT Music label and enjoyed considerable media attention and critical acclaim in the European and Japanese markets.\n\nCarrington\u2019s production and songwriting collaborations with artists such as Gino Vannelli, Peabo Bryson, Dianne Reeves, Siedah Garrett, Marilyn Scott have produced notable works as well, including her production of the Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated CD, That Day, as well as Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD, Beautiful Life, in 2014.\n\nCarrington has performed on many recordings throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s thru today. Notable examples of her work include Herbie Hancock\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD Gershwin\u2019s World, where she played alongside Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder. She has toured in many of Hancock\u2019s musical configurations (from electric to acoustic) and is featured on his Future2Future DVD.\n\nAfter a hiatus from the U.S. recording scene as a solo recording artist, Carrington returned in 2008 with More To Say... (Real Life Story: NextGen). Joining her was an impressive all-star cast of jazz and contemporary jazz instrumentalists, including George Duke, Everette Harp, Kirk Whalum, Jimmy Haslip, Greg Phillinganes, Gregoire Maret, Christian McBride, Danilo Perez, Patrice Rushen, Robert Irving III (who also serves as co-producer), Chuck Loeb, Dwight Sills, and legendary vocalists Les McCann and Nancy Wilson.\n\nCarrington released The Mosaic Project in 2011, her fifth recording overall and first on Concord Jazz. The critically acclaimed CD, which won a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, gathered a myriad of voices and crystallized them into a multi-faceted whole that far outweighed the sum of its parts. She produced the 14-song set which included some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades: Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sheila E., Nona Hendryx, Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen and several others. Carrington said the emergence of so many great female jazz instrumentalists over the last couple of decades is what made an album like The Mosaic Project possible.\n\nIn 2013, Carrington released Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue, her much anticipated homage to Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Max Roach, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of their iconic 1963 Money Jungle album. The recording featured Gerald Clayton and Christian McBride, with guests Clark Terry, Lizz Wright, Herbie Hancock and others. Carrington made history when she became the first woman to win a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Carrington releases The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL. Like its predecessor, the album presents Carrington leading a rotating cast of superb female instrumentalists and vocalists that includes Oleta Adams, Natalie Cole, Paula Cole, Lalah Hathaway, Chaka Khan, Chant\u00e9 Moore, Valerie Simpson, Nancy Wilson, Jaguar Wright and Lizz Wright, as well as saxophonist Tia Fuller, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen; bassists Meshell Ndegoecello and Linda Oh; and keyboardists Geri Allen, Patrice Rushen and Rachel Z.\n\nOn The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL, Carrington juxtaposes her salute to female artists by paying homage to various male artists who have either influenced her professionally and/or informed her musicality, such as Nick Ashford, George Duke, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Luther Vandross and Bill Withers. \u201cWhenever I do something that celebrates women, I never want it to feel like it\u2019s something that excludes men,\u201d she explains. \u201cOn this record, I consciously wanted to celebrate the various relationships women have with men either through original songs of mine or cover songs by male composers and song writers.\u201d The male presence and perspective on The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL is even more realized by Billy Dee Williams, who contributes insightful spoken-word interludes through the disc.", "otherInfo": "This evening celebrates the centenary of one of the most innovative and influential artists in modern musical history, but rather than imitating the original, it explores new perspectives on Parker's signature style.\n\nCo-directed by Terri Lyne Carrington and Rudresh Mahanthappa."}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Rudresh Mahanthappa ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8170528.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "SFJazz Center", "moreBioInfo": "Few musicians share the ability of Rudresh Mahanthappa to embody the expansive possibilities of his music with his culture. The saxophonist/composer hybridizes progressive jazz and South Indian classical music in a fluid and forward-looking form reflecting his own experience growing up a second-generation Indian-American. Just as his personal experience is never wholly lived on one side of the hyphenate or the other, his music speaks in a voice dedicated to forging a new path forward.\n\nThe current manifestations of that trajectory include his latest project Bird Calls (2015), which was named #1 album of the year by both Downbeat and NPR Music\u2019s Jazz Critics Poll. This 21st Century tribute to Charlie Parker, which Downbeat Magazine recently named Best Album of 2015, includes a stellar band of pianist Matt Mitchell, bassist Franc\u0327ois Moutin, drummer Rudy Royston, and 20-year old trumpet prodigy Adam O\u2019Farrill. The 2013 album Gamak featured guitarist David \u201cFuze\u201d Fiuczynski, whose own microtonal vocabulary opened new possibilities for Mahanthappa\u2019s compositional imagination, alongside bassist Francois Moutin and drummer Dan Weiss. The 2010 release of Samdhi (ACT Music + Vision), a multi-cultural ensemble that advances Mahanthappa\u2019s blend of jazz and Indian music with modernist electronic music, was described by JazzTimes as \u201ca landmark convergence of styles that didn't lend itself to easy analysis... new music of this caliber hasn't been attempted before.\u201d Other recent projects run the gamut from the cross-generational alto summit Apex featuring Bunky Green; trios MSG and Mauger; the quintet Dual Identity co-led with fellow altoist Steve Lehman; and Raw Materials, his long-running duo project with pianist Vijay Iyer. Mahanthappa also continues to partner with Pakistani-American guitarist Rez Abbasi and innovative percussionist Dan Weiss in the Indo-Pak Coalition, while giants in both jazz and South Indian music have recognized his success: he was enlisted by Jack DeJohnette for the legendary drummer\u2019s new working group, while a collaboration with the renowned Carnatic saxophonist Kadri Gopalnath resulted in Mahanthappa\u2019s critically- acclaimed 2008 CD Kinsmen (Pi).\n\nHailed by the New York Times as possessing \u201ca roving intellect and a bladelike articulation,\u201d Mahanthappa has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, two New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowships, and numerous commissions.

According to Miami-based music writer Karl Ross, \"Guallando\" marked the first time U.S.-born Dominican performers began to mine their musical roots for inspiration. The addictive, resulting sound appeals as readily to rap fans and world music aficionados - and to many in between. Boston Globe music writer Elijah Wald called Fulanito's sound \"fresh and hip, completely different from the mechanical beat of most house fusions\". The word \"Fulanito\" means, roughly, \"Little John Doe\" in Spanish slang. The roots of the word lie in West Africa, where Spaniards kidnapped men and women to be brought to Spanish colonies in the New World. Among the people brought to the Spanish Caribbean were those of the Fulani nation, known in Africa as great merchants. They brought their skills of commerce with them, and eventually it was known in the Caribbean that if you wanted something done, you went to the Fulani, or business guy.\n\nVargas, who is proud of his African lineage, was born in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, one year after his parents immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and grew up in a home saturated with tradition Latin sounds, including his mother's favorites: merengue and bolero.\nIn the early 1990s Vargas scored an international dance/house music hit in English with \"Wiggle It\", recorded by his first organized group, 2 in a Room. The single sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. Vargas formed a follow-up group, the 740 Boyz, with Winston de la Rosa - Arsenio de la Rosa's son.\nWhile hanging out at the de la Rosa household, Vargas was treated to many impromptu concerts by the elder de la Rosa, and was reminded of how excited Dominicans got when they heard the traditional old merengue sounds. Having shunned his parents' music for most of his life, Vargas suddenly became intrigued by the idea of combining rap, hip-hop and perico ripiao. He asked the elder de la Rosa if he would mind experimenting a bit. Soon, the accordionist and the rappers were recording \"Guallando\".\nThe song was completed in 1996, and Vargas played it for friends and family to test the waters. \"They loved it\", he says. \"They went nuts\". He approached several large Latin labels, and was rejected by all. \"They said they didn't think it would sell anywhere outside of New York and the D.R.\"\nFinally, Vargas convinced his house/dance label, Cutting Records, to press a Fulanito CD in 1997. The resulting half million in sales astounded everyone in the Latin music industry, where a mere 50,000 sold represents a gold album.\n\nFulanito's second album, \"El Padrino\" \"(The Godfather)\", was released in 1999. On it, the group experimented even more, incorporating the sounds of samba and other Latin rhythms. Vargas raps about his life, about people he has known, and about having a good time. He was sorry to see the title cut from \"El Padrino\" misinterpreted by some as glorifying gangster life, saying his intention was just the opposite. \"The gangster dies at the end\", he says. \"Sure, he had a lot of money, cars, women, but none of it mattered because he was dead\". Vargas says he wrote it with some of the young men he'd grown up with in mind. Another song on the album, \"Mother's Day,\" shows a softer side of Vargas, as he pays tribute to his mom.\n\nThe group's third album, The Remixes, was released in March of 2001, and contains three new songs. Their fourth album is expected in the fall of 2001. With a solid tour schedule that takes the group from North Carolina to Japan in the span of a month, Fulanito shows no signs of slowing down. In the coming months, Vargas and others hope to more people on the West Coast and in the mainstream U.S. market to their music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Jose, CA", "Artist": "J.

Nabozny \u2013 who has since adopted the artist name CYN \u2013 grew up in Michigan, outside Detroit. After her parents' divorce, CYN, her younger sister and her mom moved to a small house near the lake, a few miles from her dad. CYN's suburban life encouraged her to be a good student, embarking on a path to getting a decent steady job that pays the bills. Certainly something a career in songwriting could not guarantee. \u201cI wanted the typical American life,\u201d she says today. \u201cI didn't know I'd have certain opportunities back then.\u201d\n\nBorn into a humble and hardworking middle class background, CYN is the classic Midwestern gal; her electrician father works midnight shifts at Ford Motor Company six days a week, and neither of her parents' travels have led them far beyond the North America shores. Manifesting her dreams of travel, CYN has undertaken many \"first's\" for her family. Most recently, she can cross visiting Paris, Rome, and Milan off her to-do list. \u201cI'm obsessed with The Louvre,\u201d she laughs. \u201cObsessed.\u201d Despite her small town, conservative upbringing, her dreams have no limit. CYN packed her bags and headed to Hollywood in pursuit of her ultimate aspirations.\n\nGrowing up, CYN pored over the American Songbook. CYN spent a lot of time with her grandmother listening to Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and Carole King. The voices she grew up on were far subtler than some of the belting pop vocals of today. They didn't overpower, and could often be light-hearted in their message.\n\nDuring her teenage years, CYN performed in talent contests, uploaded covers on YouTube, and auditioned for lead roles\u2014all of which failed to produce ideal outcomes. She was rejected by a music school in Chicago, placing her face to face with an unfavorable reality. Opting for a degree in Management Information Systems at the city's DePaul University, she kept making music but never shouted about it and quietly took inspiration from her new city\u2019s surroundings. \u201cI have a big imagination,\u201d she says, wide-eyed. \u201cWhenever I leave my house I want to be able to feel like I'm going on an adventure. I love moving through people, I like to romanticize my life and be a character. I often refer to cities as adult playgrounds \u2013 that's what it feels like hopping on and off the subway, looking at giant buildings, wondering what they are.\u201d\n\nThe name CYN itself is tongue-in-cheek, an evolved Lolita playing on the word 'sin'. She cuts a cute figure, radiating timeless youth like a grown Shirley Temple. Yet she holds herself with a self-assured poise, like something's bubbling under her porcelain surface. \u201cSome men act shocked when they hear that I'm called CYN,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI have a lot of fun challenging people's perceptions.\u201d This girl-next-door would rather run with the boys than be their pin-up. Growing up she was picked on by local kids. She sought recognition from bullies for too long. At last, no more. Hoping that one day she can inspire other small town girls through her music, she contemplates what she wishes she would have known as an adolescent\u2026\n\n\u201cThat I would turn into a girl that I like,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI didn't like my hair, I felt insecure about my body, I had depressive thoughts. Then one day I had a dream that there was this girl on a beach. She had beautiful golden hair wrapping around her and the sun was setting. I woke up feeling so whole because I felt like I knew that girl, and that if I wanted to be that girl I could be.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Tuesday, March 16, 2020"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Tyl ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "ASEPTIC + D.O.L.

That music usually isn\u2019t played in the club. Nurko wants to change that.\n\nJack Leech always knew he would be making music, it just took a while for him to find the perfect fit. Growing up in New Jersey in a family with generations of artists, he was encouraged to be creative since birth. Picking up both drums and piano as a child and studying music in college, he applies his classical knowledge of music and music theory to buzzing genre blending sounds as Nurko.\n\nGrowing up on the internet, Nurko experimented by producing music within the trending sub genres of the time, starting with Moombahton, moving to Dubstep, and eventually playing around with Trap, Melodic Trap, and Future Bass. Inspired by both the mature sounds of Amon Tobin and Flume, the pop approved melodies of Jack U, and the fandom inducing energy of Bassnectar, Nurko makes songs that make you remember where you were when you first heard them.\n\nWanting to create a sound he hadn\u2019t heard yet, Nurko decided to channel his emotions into a style of electronic music uniquely him, starting with his first big track, \u201cGoodbye,\u201d in 2015. Since then, his next release \u201cYour Embrace,\u201d continued to give his fans what he likes to call, \u201cthe feels.\u201d They loved it, enough to listen over 2 million times. \u201cYour Embrace\u201d was featured on YouTube channels like MrSuicideSheep, Chill Nation, and was included in \u2018Neptones,\u201d JC Caylon\u2019s compilation that reached number one on the iTunes dance chart.

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit.

Not only is Clare amazing on the fiddle, but she can sing all the parts better than the rest of the band put together. Also from New Jersey, the man responsible for keeping the band in time and bringing the funk, is bass player and singer Jim Toggweiler. Helping to keep the band moving is mandolin player Tj Carskadon, from WI. Tj\u2019s harmony singing and driving backbeat help to define The High Water Line\u2019s unique rhythmic feel. Last, but certainly not least, is our amazing guitar player all the way from Monroe, Georgia, Joel Cofield.

Made in collaboration with Swedish soul singer/songwriter/phenom Magnus Tingsek, Stone\u2019s latest batch of songs capture the warm energy of that creative connection and transport the listener to a higher and more exalted plane.\n\nCulled from several dozen songs penned through a year and a half of constant writing and refining, Radius bears a title that reflects both its scope and intimacy. \u201cThe radius is that line extending from the center of the circle to its exterior,\u201d says Stone, \u201cand in a lot of ways this album is about getting out things deep inside\u2014whether it\u2019s love or insecurity or joy or frustration about things going on today.\u201d Along with immersing himself in a songwriting approach that involved unflinching examination of \u201csome very dark and negative moments in my life,\u201d Stone shaped the sound and feel of Radius by pushing himself to \u201cget past the boundaries of what I felt comfortable with, so that I could progress into a whole new level of creativity.\u201d Despite that sometimes-daunting process, Radius wholly reveals Stone\u2019s easy grace in blending everything from edgy soul-pop and earthy folk-rock to throwback R&B and Parliament-inspired funk.\n\nRadius first began to come to life back in the fall of 2013, when Stone headed to Sweden to join in a writing session with Tingsek. \u201cHis musicality is so outside-the-box, and it really stretched me as an artist,\u201d says Stone, who\u2019d tapped Tingsek as one of his opening acts for an 85-date headlining tour in 2012. \u201cWe just kept on throwing a wrench into the works and tried to create something that\u2019s the complete antithesis of what you\u2019d expect from pop music.\u201d After recording the bulk of the album in Sweden, Stone rounded out Radius\u2019s production at his own studio in the woods of northeast Washington and in L.A.-based sessions with producers like Benny Cassette (who\u2019s previously worked with Kanye West) and Malay (a co-producer on Frank Ocean\u2019s channel ORANGE).\n\nLike many of his own musical heroes\u2014Stevie Wonder chief among them\u2014Stone pulls off the near-magical feat of channeling a weight-of-the-world sensitivity into his songs while still radiating hope and promise. And though that depth of consciousness feels transmitted from a more golden era, Radius continually hones in on issues both timeless and of-the-moment, with Stone\u2019s breezily poetic lyrics touching on topics ranging from rampant materialism (on the tenderly string-accented, harmony-soaked \u201cAmerican Privilege\u201d) and the toxic takeover of technology in art (on the gutsy and groove-heavy \u201cFake Future\u201d). \u201cThat song\u2019s mainly about how technology\u2019s infiltrating music in a way that\u2019s making it less and less human and taking all the heart out of it,\u201d Stone says of the latter track, a soul-pop powerhouse peppered with playfully cutting lines like \u201cRock stars pushing buttons/Few actually play/City wasn\u2019t ever built on lights and Special K.\u201d And as evidenced by Radius\u2019s lush yet raw sonic landscape\u2014wherein the only hint of synth comes from a Moog analog synthesizer\u2014Stone stayed true to his pledge to \u201ckeep fakeness completely out of this record\u201d and rely entirely on live instrumentation.\n\nEqually introspective and outwardly searching, Radius also finds Stone exploring intensely personal matters, such as depression on the stark and lovely, acoustic-guitar-woven ballad \u201cCircle\u201d (\u201cThat one was written at a pretty dark time for me,\u201d Stone points out. \u201cIt\u2019s about how depression can put you into a kind of circle, where you\u2019re just trying to find a way out but it keeps on leading you back inside\u201d). Showing his skill at crafting a killer love song as well, Stone looks at heartbreak and regret on the aching, electric-piano-infused \u201cI Know That I Wasn\u2019t Right,\u201d slips into hopeless romanticism on the dreamy R&B pastiche \u201cBarbwire,\u201d and unleashes some starry-eyed affection on the dancefloor-ready \u201cSymmetrical\u201d (a sample lyric: \u201cThe angle of your spine/Is sending lightning bolts down mine/When those molecules combine/It\u2019s astronomically divine\u201d). And in tracks like the ultra-catchy album-opener \u201cPerfect World\u201d and the fiery, horn-laced \u201cFreedom,\u201d Radius unfolds into epically joyful anthems that show the full range and power of Stone\u2019s vocals.\n\nStone started working those vocals as a kid, thanks largely to his parents\u2019 influence. \u201cMy father was a minister so I spent about half my childhood in church, watching my mom and dad sing together and lead the congregation in song,\u201d he recalls. By the time he was 11 he\u2019d picked up a guitar and written his first song, and soon began self-recording demo tapes to pass along to classmates. Although Stone enrolled in bible college after high school, he quickly dropped out to move to Seattle and kickstart his music career. \u201cI had an \u201987 Buick and I\u2019d drive up and down the west coast, playing any gig I could get just to try to put my music out there,\u201d he says.\n\nAt age 22, Stone self-released his debut album, 2010\u2019s Last To Speak. But it was his self-titled follow-up (on which he joined forces with former Miles Davis keyboardist Deron Johnson) that ended up earning him serious recognition. Along with entering the top five on iTunes\u2019 R&B/Soul chart after its digital release, Allen Stone prompted him to score appearances on such late-night talk shows like Conan and grace the pages of publications like the New York Times (whose chief popular-music critic Jon Pareles praised Stone for possessing \u201ca tenor voice with the eagerness and frisky syncopations of [Stevie] Wonder\u201d). And upon partnering with ATO Records for a physical release of his self-titled album in 2012, Stone soon turned up on the likes of the Late Show with David Letterman and landed a gig as the opening act for soul legend Al Green. In the midst of all the buzz, he also took up a grueling touring schedule, tearing through nearly 600 shows in just two years.\n\nFor Stone, all that time onstage went a long way in preparing him for the many creative breakthroughs he\u2019s made on Radius. \u201cI think you really grow as a musician when you\u2019re playing right in front of people, and for me constantly growing and progressing and getting better is really the most important thing,\u201d he says. Ruminating on the emotional undertones of his new album\u2019s title and noting that \u201cthe center of me is my heart,\u201d Stone says he also hopes that Radius will ultimately help listeners shed new light on their own struggles. \u201cThere\u2019ve been times in my life when records were my saving grace and really helped me to figure out who I am, and I\u2019d love for my music to have that kind of impact on a kid who\u2019s looking for his or her own place in this life,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I absolutely believe that if you\u2019re going to stand at a microphone and say something, you need to recognize that as a privilege. You\u2019ve got to be incredibly careful about it, and really put all your heart into the message that you\u2019re sending out into the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "20 Cosmo Pl, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "David Byrd and Byrds of a feather ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.41236, 37.788395], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "LE COLONIAL", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "David Byrd and Byrds of a Feather at Le Colonial: Recalling Vietnam during the time of French colonization, the upscale Le Colonial restaurant features a gorgeous, palm tree-lined interior.

Speaking to the struggles we all face as working people, Kiss the Ground sends a positive message while acknowledging real hardship in a society that expects far too much. \u201cWe think of this as our ode to the working people,\u201d says Grant, whose song, \u201cGet in Line,\u201d discusses the high price we pay for things we want in life. Kiss the Ground explores real and mythological connections to the human struggle and pays homage to the \"Working Class Hero,\" an archetype famously described by John Lennon.\nPrevious Grant Farm albums include a 2012 self-titled debut and a 2014 follow up, Plowin' Time, which reached #2 on JamBand Radio Charts and charted on Americana Radio. In 2014, the band also released the Meeting on the Mountain EP, an inspired collaboration with the group Fruition.\n\nThe band has also created the acclaimed Meeting on the Mountain LIVE, a collaborative, live webcast concert experience featuring Grant Farm as the house band and Tyler Grant as host.

The LP\u2014produced entirely by Rick Vargas\u2014featured The Grouch & Eligh and Zumbi of Zion I.\n\nAfter taking some personal time following both the death of his mother and the birth of his daughter in the Summer of 2013, the sudden passing of his best friend and rap partner Maynee in January of 2014 galvanized Vocab to get back in the studio to create and record more and more music.\n\n\u201cI took that pain and poured it into my music.\u201d\n\nVocab has since released 3 projects the Somethin' Slick EP, The Issues and Episodes LP and The Day After Yesterday EP on 07/07/17", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $15 Adv & $19 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "DJ True Justice ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8960373.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Adult Contemporary Hip Hop", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "True Justice, aka The Man of Steel, has been a pioneer in the Bay Area Hip Hop scene since 1989. In an era where real deejaying skills have become scare, True Justice holds the torch, and is known for tearing clubs down in every city and every town. No stranger to hustle and showmanship, he comes from the era of constantly packing the vinyl crates and being out on the road!\n\nTrue's ambition is to showcase the amount of talent that he has amassed in the last 25 years in Northern California, better known as The Yay Area. While still in high school, True Justice was a hip hop dancer for the Oakland, CA super-group A.P.G. (Action Packed Gangstas), and at the age of 16, he found himself doing concerts with the likes of Digital Underground, Capital Tax, Paris and K-Cloud -- while witnessing first hand the birth of the independent hip hop game in the culturally rich Bay Area.\n\nFrom 1989-91, True studied A.P.G.'s master DJ J-Cutt as he amazed crowds night after night with his show-stealing solo routines with two turntables, a mixer, and two copies of the same record. When he arrived in Berkeley in 1993, True Justice (then known as DJ Skillz), traded his patent leather shoes for two Technic turntables and a Gemini mixer. For years you could see True selling cassette tapes on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, CA alongside favorites of today: Living Legends, Saafir, and the Hobo Junction.\n\nIn 1997, True formed the All Purpose DJs with Lord Takim, DJ Styles, and DJ Lex. That same year he began a career of show deejaying, first with Dream Nefra, and then later with Mic T, AceyAlone & Abstract Rude, Aesop and Planet Asia. As a duo True Justice and DJ Lex released Volume 1 in 1997, Aural Sex Volume 2 in 1998, AP2K in 2000, and Pound Fa Pound in 2004. All releases quickly became local classics. The All Purpose DJs have excited crowds with icons such as Slick Rick, Biz Markie, Notorious B.I.G., Xzibit, Phife, Keak Da Sneak, Above The Law, and E-40.\n\nIn 2004, True and Lex toured in Osaka, Japan, garnering legions of fans of their dexterity on the wheels of steel. A bonafide student of showmanship, True continued to hone his craft, and in 2007, True Justice dropped his self-titled debut album and joined forces with The Bayliens -- \"Aliens from The Bay\" -- and dropped the CD Crop Circles in the same year.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2015, True Justice toured worldwide with The Bayliens, Living Legends, Cali Agents, Mistah F.A.B., Zion I, Paris, The Alkaholiks, Jeru The Damaja, Lords Of The Underground, The Beatnuts, Onyx, Redman and EPMD.\n\nIn 2014, True founded the popular annual Slap Frost Tour with Vocab Slick and Z-Man. In 2016, he dropped his sophomore effort, The Man Of Steel on Guerrilla Funk Recordings.\n\nPress Kit:\nhttp://www.guerrillafunk.com/truejustice/manofsteel_press_kit.html", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $15 Adv & $19 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Mike Marshall ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9787778.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Country, Bluegrass", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Cornerstone Craft Beer & Live Music", "moreBioInfo": "Michael Marshall is an R&B soul singer, from Berkeley California, with a love for hip-hop.

With D-Loc, DJ Darryl, and JED, Rich crafted a Bay Area classic called 41Fivin', which sold well around the region and spawned a Richie Rich solo album, Don't Do It. As the group was ready to sign a major-label contract with Priority in 1990, however, Richie Rich was arrested for possession of cocaine. 415 released its next album and faded from the scene soon after, while Rich sat in jail; he was released a year later, and began appearing on tracks by the Luniz and 2Pac before forming his own label Oakland Hills 41510 and releasing 1/2 Thang. By 1995, Richie Rich had become the first Bay Area rapper to sign with New York's Def Jam Records, and his major-label solo debut, Seasoned Veteran, was released in late 1996. This CD had some of his most memorable classics; \"Lets Ride\" and the Tupac tribute \"Do G's Get To Go\". The two most famous songs he did with Tupac are; \"Rather be your Nigga\" & \"Aint Hard To Find\" which featured other Bay Area artists.

Clearly Jody Wisternoff is a man whose personal dictionary doesn\u2019t contain the term \u2018tread water\u2019.\nJody has indeed been pushing the envelope his entire career, which started at the very early age of 13 years when he and brother Sam prodigiously reached the finals of the DMC HipHop Championships. This success was compounded two years later when they found national fame as Tru Funk, landing themselves on the pages of cult magazine The Face and Tim Westwood\u2019s Radio 1 playlist. \u201cObviously it was a different genre to what I\u2019m known for now,\u201d explains Jody, \u201cBristol\u2019s always been renowned for the calibre of its dub scene and the artists that have come out of it. In the late 80\u2018s and early 90\u2018s I was very much a part of that movement, which provided me with an invaluable foothold in the world of dance. I soon found myself DJing to thousands at fondly remembered festivals such as Universe and Fantazia. It was a crazy time.\u201d\nThese formative years were influential too, for it was this background that underpinned the ethos of Way Out West, which Jody founded with Nick Warren following a chance meeting in a local record shop. Fusing Bristol\u2019s dub roots with club beats Way Out West captured a sound unlike any other at that time and burst onto the mid-nineties dance scene with\nseminal hits such as \u2018Ajare\u2019 and top ten smash \u2018The Gift\u2019, which they even performed on Top of the Pops (RIP). When not appearing on nationally treasured TV programmes they could be found remixing the likes of Roni Size, M-People, Orbital, Tiesto, Sasha, BT, UNKLE, James Holden and Fatboy Slim\u2019s Freak Power alter ego; touring the world alongside dance titans Faithless and The Prodigy and collaborating with Trevor Horn, arguably one of Britain\u2019s most successful and revered producers. How many can boast a CV like that?\nBut perhaps most remarkable of all is that, in this highly disposable world of dance, Way Out West continues to this day. Currently working on their fifth album, Jody explains the key to their longevity, \u201cIt\u2019s because we don\u2019t live in each others pockets and take long breaks between WOW projects. In other words, we keep it fresh. It\u2019s a cycle of about 4 years focusing on solo stuff, followed by a year back together, which is great because we bring all our new experiences from this time apart time and feed it back into the band. It\u2019s not something we planned, or rather, do plan, it\u2019s a schedule and process that\u2019s developed over time and works.\u201d\nSo what of Jody\u2019s solo endeavours? Well, if you think these are fallow periods living off the echo of past Way Out West achievements, you\u2019d be very, very wrong indeed. Once again Jody\u2019s incomparable ability to succeed with production and DJing has seen him climb to the highest heights of Beatport (and we\u2019re talking THE overall, not genre chart here) and iTunes;\nremix Above & Beyond, Robert Babicz and more; tour the UK alongside 808 State legend Graham Massey; maintain a monthly show \u2018Intensified \u2019 on Frisky radio, now in it\u2019s eighth(!) year; take on an A&R development role for Anjunadeep signing acts such as Lane8 and Lancelot and, as if all of that weren\u2019t enough, release his own solo album, \u2018Trails We Blaze\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fitting to end this biog as I began,\u201d concludes Jody, \u201cI really am busier now than ever, which is a blessing. Whether I\u2019m in the studio, playing to 5\nthousand alongside A&B at the Ally Pally or touring the world, I\u2019m still as excited by what I do now as I was when I began.

This soon caught the attention of Grammy-Nominated Songwriter Jaret Reddick of Bowling For Soup, who saw an opportunity to work with a promising and exciting new band - something vocalist Liv describes as a \"pinch me moment\" working alongside one of her musical heroes.\n\nThe superstar collaboration opened up exciting new doors - a SOLD OUT Tour with Bowling For Soup, followed by a slot on the final Cross Country Vans Warped Tour which saw its founder Kevin Lyman declaring them 'The future of women in rock or just rock in general' and earned NOT UR GIRLFRENZ the title of \u2018the Youngest Touring Band in Warped's 24 year history'! \"You look into the crowd before a show and see some of your biggest influences staring back at you!\" reveals Maren about the Warped experience.

The Dollyrots have gone from young up-and-comers to basically the parents of the punk scene - literally, as lead singer/bassist Kelly and guitarist Luis have a duo of \"dollytots\" that happily tour with their punk rock parents. Many original fans have followed the same trajectory as the band (live, you'll see a refreshing mix of \"cool dads\" and young punks). Not a whole lot of good came out of the early 2000s, but the Dollyrots sprung forth as an in-your-face pop punk trio and haven't let the years soften their sound or force them into a more practical life of day jobs. Over the last two decades, The Dollyrots have perfected their craft: relatable lyrics, soaring guitars, tight songwriting that keeps songs punchy. Even with two kids, the band hits the road often and keeps the new tunes flowing. And their hard work has paid off: the band has played with Black Flag, put an album out on Joan Jett's Blackheart label as well as Little Steven Van Zandt's Wicked Cool label, and is besties with Bowling For Soup. Even though the band has finally returned to their home state of Florida, The Dollyrots are still the beloved flag bearers for the \"kiss or kill\" California sound of yore - and if their past touring schedule is a clue, they'll be visiting their adopted home pretty often. \u25cf The kids truly are alright!

Sui Zhen\u2019s third album, Losing, Linda, pairs her signature inquisitiveness with a surreal electronic pop that possesses a dreamlike quality: vivid, uncanny, and upon close examination, revealing of deep emotional and personal truths. It\u2019s an album that examines loss on multiple levels \u2014 from the death of our loved ones, to our widespread societal tendency to disappear within the ones and zeroes of modern life's tech-driven rush.\n\nLosing, Linda is the latest chapter in Melbourne artist Becky Sui Zhen's musical journey, which has, to date, included involvement in the Red Bull Music Academy, and spanned collaborations with dance and electronic artists like NO ZU, Retiree and Tornado Wallace (featuring on the producer\u2019s standout \u201cToday\u201d from 2017\u2019s Lonely Planet). She\u2019s also been commissioned for scoring and composition work in the ambient sphere, such as creating a \u201cspatially aware soundtrack\u201d to an exhibition at the Art Gallery of NSW, and providing the live score for Chris Marker's 1983 documentary Sans Soleil. This year alone will include performances at Dark Mofo, Meredith Festival, and Inner Varnika, plus collaborations with M\u00f8zaika and a track on an upcoming compilation for Munich\u2019s Public Possession label.\n\nSui Zhen released her debut album, Two Seas, in 2012. Beguiling and enchanting, the record proved to be an early indication of her fascinating melodic structures and compelling lyrical themes \u2014 but it was 2015's Secretly Susan that would be her breakthrough. Drawing on dub, lounge, and bossa nova influences, Secretly Susan presents as a synth-pop simulacrum, exploring digital life's myriad intersections with the real. \u201cBrilliant and uncanny,\u201d Pitchfork writes, the album \u201cradiates humor and charm.\u201d\n\nThe story of Sui Zhen\u2019s latest album, Losing, Linda, began in August of 2016, when she took up an artistic residency in Sapporo, a Japanese city on the northern island of Hokkaido. Sui Zhen originally came to the residency equipped with demos conceived in the wake of Secretly Susan \u2014 but real-life tragedy intervened, as her mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Sui Zhen\u2019s family insisted she continue with the residency as planned, but the experience proved indelible and she abandoned the demos to start anew.\n\nIn the process, a sense of overall mortality was unmistakably infused into the thematic structure of Losing, Linda. It\u2019s apparent across the lyrical sentiments of the swingy, bossa nova-laden \"I Could Be There,\u201d as Sui Zhen sings with straightforward zest, \"When you show me that you know all that's left to be/ That's the only way you knew to raise our family.\" It\u2019s a powerful sentiment turned askew, delivered with lightness over pitter-patter drums and rubbery bass lines; a characteristic duality of Sui Zhen\u2019s work. Elsewhere, \u201cMountain Song\u201d describes a traumatic and potentially fatal hiking expedition on Mount Asahidake \u2014 a memento mori, subtly and stealthily rendered with a bossa nova lilt and soft orchestration.\n\nAfter the residency came to a close, Sui Zhen's band members \u2014 instrumentalists Ashley Bundang (Zone Out, Hot Palms, Ciggie Witch) and Alec Marshall (Hot Palms, Emma Russack) \u2014 joined her in the Tokyo-adjacent city of Matsudo to track full-band demos for the material she'd written back in Sapporo. The new locale also inspired the gentle oscillations of \"Matsudo City Life,\" a throbbing synth-pop slice of effervescence that practically sounds like steam rising off of a nocturnal city street.\n\nSui Zhen eventually returned to Australia to be with her family, with work on the album becoming more sporadic as her mother's health declined, leading up to her passing in February 2018. \u201cLooking back it was pretty intense,\u201d Sui Zhen says. \u201cThere\u2019s moments that occurred that haunt me still. And some of those moments have been recreated in my video project \u2013 turned into art, memories of memories.\u201d\n\nAfter some time away from the album, Losing, Linda was completed near the end of 2018. \"I finally felt ready to return to the album,\" Sui Zhen explains. The resulting record pushes the fascinating sounds and ideas of Secretly Susan further and deeper, drawing equally from the plush realms of Sade, Japanese city pop, the early electronic music of the 1980s, and the mournful swing of Tracey Thorn's early work. Sui Zhen cites a range of forward-thinking artists from past and present as inspiration, from Lizzy Mercier and Laurie Anderson to Holly Herndon and Suzanne Ciani. The lush body-moving pop of \"Being a Woman,\" for example, finds Sui Zhen's personal experience colliding with her own self-investigation, as she sings about her relationship and struggles with femininity: \"When I grew up/ I thought I had to be/ Somebody's mother/ Or somebody's daughter.\" It's a striking example of the personal, political, and societal themes at the center of Losing, Linda, packaged as an infinitely listenable pop song.\n\nMuch as Secretly Susan was constructed around a titular character, on Losing, Linda Sui Zhen takes the theoretical form of \"Linda,\" a digital doppelga\u0308nger and avatar invoking the e-learning channel Lynda and its founder Lynda Weinman, as well as the humanoid robot BINA48. The character of Linda is personified on the album's cover by choreographer and colleague Megan Payne, whose literal embodiment of Linda interrogates the disembodiment of online life, and calls into question the possibility of death in the digital age. \"It\u2019s an album about missing people after they are gone and trying to pre-empt loss \u2014 not only loss of life, but memory and information,\" Sui Zhen explains. \"I see it mirrored in our increasing need for data storage. Why are we collecting and documenting so much, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a simple ghost story about being haunted by our other versions and our past selves,\u201d she continues. \u201cOur mothers, fathers, ancestors \u2014 that possibility that another may exist, intangible in the physical realm, but ever present in memory, so long as memory functions.\"\n\nThe album will also be accompanied by a digital ecosystem, aiming to create an online world for listeners where they can interact in real time with Linda. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere between a ghost, a memory, and a digital assistant\" Sui Zhen explains. In other words, a perfect evocation of what Losing, Linda represents thematically and musically: a trip through the real and the uncanny. Losing, Linda is a lovingly personal and humanistic document of our ever-changing world, the things we lose along the way, and the insights we gain from loss itself.", "otherInfo": "Banoffee & Sui Zhen LIVE at Cafe Du Nord on Thursday, April 2nd, 2020!\nThis show is 18+ with a valid ID.

From his early years playing under the tutelage of bluegrass patriarch Bill Monroe, and following his stint in Old & In the Way with Jerry Garcia and subsequent breakout as both a solo performer and bandleader, Rowan has built a devoted, international fan base through his continuous stream of original recordings, collaborative projects, and constant touring.\n\nBorn in Wayland, Massachusetts to a musical family, Rowan first learned to play guitar from his uncle. He spent his teenage years absorbing the sights and sounds of the Boston music scene, playing bluegrass at the Hillbilly Ranch and discovering folk and blues across the Charles River at the legendary Club 47 on Mt. Auburn Street in Cambridge. \"I could sit in with the Lilly Brothers at the Hillbilly Ranch and then catch the MTA and be in time for Joan Baez's last set at the Club 47. Bluegrass appealed to me. It was callin' me\u2014the harmonies, that high and lonesome calling-sound. Don Stover had played banjo with Bill Monroe, fiddler Tex Logan too, before they joined the Lillys. Mandolinist Joe Val taught me all the Blue Sky Boys and the Louvin Brothers songs. I would play a \"sock-hop\" with my rockin' group, The Cupids, and then make a beeline for the clubs. Sonny Terry and Brownie Magee, Josh White, Muddy Waters- they all came to town! \"\n\nFollowing three years in college, Rowan left academia to pursue a life in music. Rowan began his professional career in 1964 as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist for Bill Monroe and The Bluegrass Boys, living in Nashville and playing with Monroe on the Grand Ol' Opry every week. \"One thing I liked about the Monroe style was that there was a lot more blues in it than other styles of bluegrass,\" reflects Rowan. \"It was darker. It had more of an edge to it. And yet it still had the ballad tradition in it, and I loved that.\" Rowan stayed with Monroe and his Bluegrass Boys, touring constantly both in the United States and in England, for two and a half years. \" We went from old-timey places way down south to the colleges up north, we played to all ages, long-time fans of Bluegrass and the college kids my own age.\"\n\nThe late '60s and early 70's saw Rowan collaborating with musical compatriots in a number of rock, folk and bluegrass combinations: Earth Opera with David Grisman, Sea Train with fiddler Richard Greene (himself a graduate of Monroe's band) Muleskinner with both Grisman and Greene, former Bluegrass Boy banjoist Bill Keith and the great Clarence White. From the ashes of Muleskinner, Rowan and Grisman went on to join Jerry Garcia, Vassar Clements, and John Kahn, forming the legendary bluegrass band Old & In the Way. It was during this time that Rowan penned the song \"Panama Red,\" a subsequent hit for the New Riders of the Purple Sage and a classic ever since. Other time-honored compositions by Rowan include \" Moonlight Midnight\", \" In The Land of the Navajo\" and \"Lonesome L.A. Cowboy\u201d. Jerry Garcia himself recorded Rowan's \"Moonlight Midnight\" and the haunting \"Mississippi Moon\". The 1970\u2019s also saw Peter Rowan playing and recording alongside brothers Chris and Lorin Rowan as the The Rowan Brothers. Their three albums for Elektra-Asylum featured original songs highlighted by the three siblings soaring harmonies.\n\nRowan subsequently embarked on a well-received solo career in 1978, releasing such critically acclaimed records as Dustbowl Children (a Woody Guthrie style song cycle about humanity's spirituality in relationship to the earth), Yonder (a record of old-time country songs and Rowan originals in collaboration with ace dobro player, Jerry Douglas) and two extraordinarily fine bluegrass albums, The First Whippoorwill and Bluegrass Boy, as well as High Lonesome Cowboy, a recording of traditional old-time cowboy songs with Don Edwards and guitarist Norman Blake. Rowan's recent releases- Reggaebilly, a wonderful blend of reggae and bluegrass and Quartet, a recording with the phenomenal Tony Rice, coupled with a relentless touring schedule have further endeared Peter Rowan to audiences around the world.\n\nOn the road, Rowan performs internationally as a solo singer-songwriter, while stateside he plays in three bands: the Peter Rowan Bluegrass Band, a quartet featuring Jody Stecher, Keith Little, and Paul Knight; The Peter Rowan & Tony Rice Quartet; and his rocking band, The Free Mexican Air Force.", "otherInfo": "Berkeley Bluegrass Festival - 4-Day Pass"}, {"Address": "1030 Main St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "3 on a Match ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Thu Apr 2 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-02", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Napa", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Full Food and Bar Menu Available in all sections3 on a Match is an authentic Dylan-to-Delta blues and folk vintage American music group that debuted in the Wine Country in 2006.

Particularly in the beneath-the-radar substreams of American folk music and bluegrass, it is bestowed more by whispered word-of-mouth, over years and decades, than by the hurried hype and ballyhoo of the pop mainstream. You can't measure Laurie Lewis's 30-year career with the usual commercial yardsticks. She has won a Grammy (\"True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe,\" 1997), and twice been named Female Vocalist of the Year by the IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association).\n\nIf you listen down the backroads of acoustic Americana, however, you'll soon realize this soft-spoken, sweet-singing California fiddler, singer and songwriter is something very special. \"Judging by the respect she has among fans and peers in the industry,\" says IBMA executive director Dan Hays, \"Laurie is one of the pre-eminent bluegrass and Americana artists of our time. She spreads her talent over several genres - bluegrass, folk, country - and with the recognition she has within all those fields, I would certainly say she's one of the top five female artists of the last 30 years. And she continues to make great music.\" This measure of respect is all the more remarkable given what a groundbreaking revolutionary Lewis has been, the first bona fide bluegrass star who was a woman born outside the music's native southland. It is hard to tell whether her being a woman or a Californian impacted the music more, but what is clear is that she is a pivotal figure in transforming the music from a regional genre into a truly international musical language. \"She's opened a lot of doors for our music,\" says Hays. \"There were certainly female artists in bluegrass before her, but to do what she's done with her own unique style, as opposed to mimicking her male counterparts, she's been a real pioneer in that regard. It goes beyond her just being a woman, though she's set a wonderful example for female artists. Her whole approach to music has had a positive influence throughout the country.\"\n\nSam Bush is such a pivotal figure in the modern bluegrass revival that the subgenre of progressive bluegrass was nicknamed after the band he founded in the 1970s, the Newgrass Revival. He warns against making too much fuss about Lewis being influential simply because of her gender or where she hails from. \"She is newgrass in the truest sense of the word, in that she uses bluegrass instruments to create new original music: it's music for now,\" he says. \"Laurie is very genderless to me. I know that's not the right way to put it, but I just think of her as an artist: a great singer, terrific fiddle player, fine songwriter, and one very good band leader. As a fiddler, she could be from the 1940s or from 2010; it's timeless,\" he says. \"As a singer, she knows the rules of bluegrass and how to sing in her own voice. She's probably one of the few female singers who really knows the nuances of the Ralph Stanley vocal style.\"\n\nThe Sacramento News called her \"as fine a singer as anyone on the acoustic music circuit, anywhere in the world.\" Billboard praised her ability to \"successfully walk the high wire above esoteric country, combining elements of bluegrass and pure country to form her own seamless mix.\" Or as American folk icon Utah Phillips put it, \"Whatever country music is supposed to be, she's at the center of it.\" Her songs have traveled as widely as she has, but it is revealing to see who has recorded them: Kathy Mattea, Patsy Montana, Jeannie Kendall, Prudence Johnson - all revered as supreme stylists and song-finders.\n\nLaurie fell in love with American folk music as a teenager, at the sunset of the '60s folk revival. It was the vastness, the realness, the melodicism, and welcoming accessibility that drew her. \"Oh, it was so exciting,\" she says of the Berkeley Folk Festivals where she first caught the folk bug. \"Every night there were concerts, and during the day you'd be in a eucalyptus grove listening to someone making music with nothing between you and them. Every day I'd hear something new, Doc Watson or the Greenbrier Boys. Something about it just invited me to start playing it.\" She began plunking out simple songs on the guitar, then the fiddle. After high school, she drifted away from the music, but always kept her fiddle under her bed, though she didn't know why. In her early 20s, she discovered the Bay Area bluegrass scene. To her, it was \"like opening that door all over again. Here were all these people making music together, and I could immediately see myself as part of it. It woke up all that excitement I felt as a teenager, and I knew this was what I wanted to do with my life.\"\n\nThe bluegrass scene of Northern California was a powerful mix of the region's historic progressivism and ardent devotion to musical tradition. Nobody minded that young Lewis was a woman, a non-southerner, or a novice. They did mind if she didn't want to learn, chapter and verse, the gospels of Bill Monroe and Ralph Stanley. It gave her a rock-ribbed foundation in the rudiments of American roots music. \"It really was a different deal coming to bluegrass in the San Francisco Bay area,\" she says. \"There weren't a lot of cutting contests; it was all about making music together, a focus on interdependency rather than individual prowess.\"\n\nLewis never intended to kick in any doors, but she detested anything that excluded anyone from the music she loved. In the mid-70s, she helped found the Good Ol' Persons, an all-female ensemble that was soon headlining major folk and bluegrass festivals around the country, cheerfully breaking gender barriers that had kept women serving primarily as vocalists in male-dominated bands. She began writing her own songs then, inspired by bandmate Kathy Kallick, with whom she has collaborated many times over the years. It was in Lewis's next band, Grant Street, which she fronted, that her writing came to the fore. Her songs reflect everything she loves about folk music. No matter how quick-tempo, they never seem crowded, either melodically or lyrically. She does not sing inscrutably about her own life, but looks outward from an intimate perspective, in ways that let us see our own lives reflected back at us.\n\nHer songs helped shape the template for the modern bluegrass-pop style. She loves to play off the rhythm, helping to free the genre from its barnburning tick-tock cadence, and giving her songs a sweet sense of space that makes them at once inventive and warmly familiar.\n\nLewis's performing companion is ace mandolinist-singer Tom Rozum. Their 1996 CD, \"The Oak and the Laurel,\" was nominated for a Grammy. \"I love to have a partner to sing with, crave it deep down inside,\" Lewis says. \"And Tom's the same way. He's a very conversational mandolin player, always responding to what's going on at the moment.\"\n\nLewis's stage shows are renowned for their musical virtuosity and front-porch friendliness. Coming of age in such a convivial music scene, she has a keen gift for inviting audiences into her music. As with everything she plays, the point is sharing, not strutting.\n\nThat may not be the recipe for big-time stardom in this myopic, hype-happy age, but it remains the recipe for timeless music, and for careers like hers that are built not to dazzle but to last. And it remains the real stuff of legend, at least in the quiet corners of our culture where American roots music still thrives.", "otherInfo": "Berkeley Bluegrass Festival - 4-Day Pass"}, {"Address": "1799 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Joey Avery ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9508261.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419723, 37.768401], "Date": "Thu Apr 2 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-02", "Genre": "San Francisco, California", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "SUBMISSION: Cocktails & Comedy", "moreBioInfo": "After starting his career in Cape Town, South Africa Joey Avery brought his positive and energetic brand of comedy to San Francisco and received the Jimmy Gunn award for Best Newcomer to the Bay Area comedy scene.

We love music.\u201d\n\nIt all started back in 2005 when Daniela was five and Paulina was three years old and had their first experience with music when attending a summer camp with music and theatre activities. They liked it very much and started attending regularly to music and drama classes and about a year later they both enrolled in piano lessons. They listened from children\u2019s songs and lullabies to straight up rock and roll AC/DC and new stuff like Muse.\n\nFast forward a couple years later in 2007 when Daniela turned 8 and Paulina 6 and the most popular video game in the world was ROCK BAND. This was a huge influence on which instruments the girls would start playing next. Daniela, since she always grabbed the toy guitar used on the video game, thought it would be a great idea to take on the strings without quitting her piano lessons. Paulina felt it was a total injustice that her older sister could start playing another instrument and she wasn\u2019t. Again, thanks to ROCK BAND, her parents noticed she had a great sense of rhythm and coordination, so they enrolled her in drum lessons where she could play on a real drum set.\n\nAlejandra, being the youngest, had a whole different approach to music. She had to wait until she was five years old to enroll in piano and music lessons. Being raised in a house full of music and the role models that her older sisters came to be for her always kept her motivated to take a leap into music properly. It took her a lot of music-video-binging for her to realize she wanted to try out bass guitar, because she really loved the sound it made.\n\n\u201cMany people assume our parents are musicians, but they are not. They just share with us our love and passion for music.\u201d\n\nThe girls never planned to form a band, especially since Alejandra was really small (in age and size, still plays a smaller scale bass). The girls just liked playing music. It was a Christmas Holiday\u2019s school festival where Daniela and Paulina decided to play together a song that they had been working on separately. Of course, they needed a bass guitar to complete the power trio and thought it would be a great idea to have Alejandra play with them regardless of her being smaller. The girls played even better than they expected and Alejandra could handle the bass lines as if she had been playing for years.\n\nThey satisfaction and enjoyment of that first musical experience on stage was so big that they started practicing more songs together, setting higher goals for each on their instrument, goals that they saw and heard in music from the rock and roll bands they loved listening to.\n\nThey started videotaping those rehearsals and uploading them to their YouTube channel, where they had a few followers and with time started gaining more. But it wasn\u2019t until they uploaded a cover for the song \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d by the band Metallica. This one broke the internet.\n\nIn just a few days it went viral and millions of people from all around the world became hardcore fans of THE WARNING, setting of a series of events that would kick the girls into the musical scene in a way nobody expected.\n\nIn January 2015 they recorded their first EP with songs written and performed by them. Playing and experimenting through different styles and genres they found that hard rock and metal was the kind of music they loved playing.\n\nBy this time, the sisters had a dream: attending a five-week summer course at Berklee College of Music. They created a GoFundMe campaign to raise the money they needed to go attend the summer course. The Ellen DeGeneres Show found the girl\u2019s viral video online and invited them to appear in the show for an interview and performance. Thanks to the huge support that Ellen showed to the girls and the significant fan base they had gained in their social media, they raised the money to attend to Berklee, where the talk show also followed and documented the girl\u2019s experience during their summer course for EllenTube.\n\nInspired by THE WARNING\u2019s achievements by this time, the American video game developers Harmonix Music Systems were aware that their Rock Band video game had been the catalyst for this online phenomena, so they reached out to the girls, invited them to visit their facilities and included their single Free Falling in the latest version of the game, Rock Band 4.\n\nFUN FACT: During their visit at Harmonix they were asked by the developers to play their own song on the new Rock Band 4 console.\n\nBy this time they started receiving offers to play in different venues around the U.S.A. and M\u00e9xico. These are a few of their shows up to 2017:\n\n\u2022 Musak Festival (California, USA)\n\u2022 Pal Norte Festival (Monterrey, MX)\n\u2022 Gibson Guitars Showcase (Beverly Hills, USA)\n\u2022 House Of Blues (Anaheim, USA)\n\u2022 SXSW Music Fest 2015 (Austin, USA)\n\u2022 TEDx Talks 2016 (Reno, USA)\n\u2022 Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 (Boston, USA)\n\u2022 Sunshine Festival (Texas, USA)\n\u2022 SXSW Music Fest 2016 (Austin, USA)\n\u2022 Caf\u00e9 Iguana (Monterrey, MX)\n\u2022 Nirvana Rock Joint (Monterrey, MX)\n\u2022 TEDx Talks 2017 (Reno, USA)\n\nDuring the time of these shows and different stages they started the songwriting process for their first LP. During 2016 they worked in the recordings, editing and mixing of 13 songs written by them and included in their first studio LP: XXI CENTURY BLOOD.\n\nXXI CENTURY BLOOD is to be released on March 27th, 2017 along with a music video for their first single also titled \u201cXXI Century Blood\u201d. The band will be rehearsing and working on a series of concerts soon to be announced around the U.S.A. and M\u00e9xico.\n\n\nYOU\u2019VE BEEN WARNED.", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30 // Show 8 // ALL SALES ARE FINAL"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Tony Trischka ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7054778.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Thu Apr 2 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-02", "Genre": "Country, Bluegrass", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse", "moreBioInfo": "The avant-garde banjo sylings of Tony Trischka inspired a whole generation of progressive bluegrass musicians; he was not only considered among the very best pickers, he was also one of the instrument's top teachers, and created numerous instructional books, teaching video tapes and cassettes.\n\nA native of Syracuse, New York, Trischka's interest in banjo was sparked by the Kingston Trio's \"Charlie and the MTA\" in 1963. Two years later, he joined the Down City Ramblers, where he remained through 1971. That year, Trischka made his recording debut on 15 Bluegrass Instrumentals with the band Country Cooking; at the same time, he was also a member of Country Granola. In 1973, he began a two-year stint with Breakfast Special. Between 1974 and 1975, he recorded two solo albums, Bluegrass Light and Heartlands. After one more solo album in 1976, Banjoland, he went on to become musical leader for the Broadway show The Robber Bridegroom. Trischka toured with the show in 1978, the year he also played with the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nBeginning in 1978, he also played with artists such as Peter Rowan, Richard Greene, and Stacy Phillips. In the early 1980s, he began recording with his new group Skyline, which recorded its first album in 1983. Subsequent albums included Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas (solo, 1983), Stranded in the Moonlight (with Skyline, 1984) and Hill Country (solo, 1985). In 1984, he performed in his first feature film, Foxfire. Three years later, he worked on the soundtrack for Driving Miss Daisy. Trischka produced the Belgian group Gold Rush's No More Angels in 1988. The following year, Skyline recorded its final album, Fire of Grace. He also recorded the theme song for Books on the Air, a popular National Public Radio Show, and continued his affiliation with the network by appearing on Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion, Mountain Stage, From Our Front Porch, and other radio shows. Trischka's solo recordings include 1993's World Turning, 1995's Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection and 1999's Bend. New Deal followed in 2003.

While still studying at the Juilliard School, Mike joined Yo-Yo Ma\u2019s Silk Road Ensemble, with which he has toured extensively throughout the world, and won a 2017 Grammy Award for Best World Music Album. Mike is also an active recording artist of original material, folk music, cross-cultural collaborations, and he has an ongoing project to record all of the Bach cello suites in acoustically glorious bathrooms of famous concert halls, via BachInTheBathroom.com. As one of the first wave of cellists to adopt a strap in order to stand and move while playing, Mike was the first standing cellist to perform at Carnegie Hall, using a cello strap of his own design, called the Block Strap, a performance which the NY Times called \"Breathless ... Half dance, half dare.\"\n\nAs a music educator, Mike is passionate about emphasizing creativity and collaboration, leading to the founding of the Mike Block String Camp in 2010. MBSC provides players of all backgrounds the opportunity to learn from a world-class faculty in a variety of styles, and supports the exploration and development of the artistic voice of each student. Mike is also the founding Director of the Silkroad Global Musician Workshop, bringing together musicians from around the globe, and he created the online Multi-Style Cello School at ArtistWorks.com, with an extensive library of instructional videos. In 2012, Mike was appointed Associate Professor at the Berklee College of Music.

When still living in New York City, Mike regularly subbed on Broadway as on-stage cellist for the Pulitzer Prize winning musical, \"Next to Normal\", and he also worked as Music Consultant on the 2012 film, \"A Late Quartet\". Mike was the subject of a 2011 feature article in the Wall Street Journal for his Artistic Directorship of the GALA BROOKLYN Music Festival, featuring cross-cultural collaborations among locally-based musicians.\n\nMike attended college at the Cleveland Institute of Music, where he studied cello with Richard Aaron, and received the Jim Hall Prize for Undergraduate Achievement. Mike also earned a Master\u2019s Degree from the Juilliard School, where he studied with Darrett Adkins and Joel Krosnick.

Speaking to the struggles we all face as working people, Kiss the Ground sends a positive message while acknowledging real hardship in a society that expects far too much. \u201cWe think of this as our ode to the working people,\u201d says Grant, whose song, \u201cGet in Line,\u201d discusses the high price we pay for things we want in life. Kiss the Ground explores real and mythological connections to the human struggle and pays homage to the \"Working Class Hero,\" an archetype famously described by John Lennon.\nPrevious Grant Farm albums include a 2012 self-titled debut and a 2014 follow up, Plowin' Time, which reached #2 on JamBand Radio Charts and charted on Americana Radio.

Larrieux left the group for a solo career in 1999 and was replaced by Mekada Davis. The new line-up also signified a dramatic change in style for the group which took a more contemporary R&B approach for their second album, The Answer. Despite moderate success of the first single \"4 Sure\" and a remix featuring Mya and Jagged Edge, The Answer went unreleased and the group stopped recording. Since, Wilson has appeared in the movie 'Beauty Shop' starring Queen Latifah, and he and Davis continue to write together for other artists like Beyonc\u00e9 and Amerie.", "otherInfo": "\"Groove Theory\" w/ DJ Natural"}, {"Address": "424 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Bubble ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8065051.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.429362, 37.772531], "Date": "Thu Apr 2 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-02", "Genre": "Psytrance, Psy Trance, Goa Trance, Electronic", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Underground SF", "moreBioInfo": "Follow Bubble www.soundcloud.com/bubble-music www.youtube.com/bubblexmusic", "otherInfo": "\"Bubble\" at Underground SF: This small, dark, and unpretentious Lower Haight spot attempts to inject a subversive element back into the nightclub scene - and, for the most part, it succeeds.
