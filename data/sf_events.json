The project enlivens a style of patchwork storytelling in an experimental electronic environment as fronted by vocalist Tamar Kamin, and engineered by sound designer Scott Taylor. Recordings involve many other musicians, notably including bass guitarist Tom Altes who toured with the project from 2007-2013.\n\nThe project started in 2007 with a 20-song debut \u201cMeal Ticket to Purgatory.\u201d This home-recorded, lo-fi album includes vocalists Tamar Kamin & former member Martine Mancini. Steeped in a twisted, awkwardly wry lyrical nostalgia for 1960's girl group pop a la Burt Bacharach/Phil Spector, the album received strong critical and underground approval. An invitation to play with Stereolab and Atlas Sound catalyzed the members to create a live band capable of pulling off a heady concept.\n\nIn 2009, the sophomore album \u201cSuperpowerfragilis: Or How I Learned To Stop Caring And Love The Drug\u201d was an evolution further into the sphere of pop social commentary, grabbing the complementary attention of Julian Cope at Head Heritage. In support of this record the members embarked on a visual vessel that would cut a new jib to their productivity in media. Two self-produced music videos were released for the songs \u201cLovely In Akron\u201d and \u201cOut To Lunch\u201d in 2010.\n\nVisual accompaniment would become a permanent addition to the live show as Scott Taylor became the group\u2019s sound designer and engineer. Once they had refined a live concept, they began touring more frequently and between national performances the group continued with home recordings. Fluctuating between psychedelic arias, grandiose cinematic scores, off-kilter jazz and swirling breakbeats, the \u201cSongs\u201d EP (2013) received international reviews from The Wire Magazine. Opportunity surfaced for another full-fledged video production in The Knox Building - at the time, a vacant commercial space in Youngstown, OH - now a thriving hub of activity in the area. This music video for the title track \u201cSongs\u201d premiered on the Decoder Magazine blog.\n\nThe 3rd LP \"Heaven On A Branch\" (2014) is a continuation of patchwork production, using manipulated turntable channels that are chopped up and reconstructed to conform to chord structures of instrumentation. Vocals work as another unique instrument in themselves with a soulful delivery. The quirky bubble-gum pop single \u201cOne On The Board\u201d is calculated psychedelic ride with an array of switches in production style. The third video from the album \u201cAfternoon Walk Of Shame\u201d premiered at The Manor Theater in Pittsburgh - December 2016.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "399 9th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Cognitive Dissonance", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6595901.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.409983, 37.772814], "Date": "Sun Jan 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Stud", "moreBioInfo": "Our goal is to produce the highest quality records possible for people who still believe that punk and hardcore is about music with a message.", "otherInfo": "\"Cognitive Dissonance\" at The Stud: Although small and cramped when packed, the Stud rules over other gay clubs with some of the best local DJs, innovative club nights, wild drag queen performances, and overall atmosphere.

Unlike other pastichists, who tend to duck passion, Mr. Frisell plays up the pleasure in the music and also takes on another often-avoided subject, tenderness.\"\n\n\n\nFrisell\u2019s recordings over the last decades span a wide range of musical influences. His catalog, including over twenty recordings for Nonesuch, has been cited by Downbeat as \u201cthe best recorded output of the decade.\u201d It includes original Buster Keaton film scores to arrangements of music for extended ensemble with horns (This Land, Blues Dream); adaptations of his compositions originally written as sound-tracks to Gary Larson cartoons (Quartet); interpretations of work by other classic and contemporary American composers (Have a Little Faith) ; and collaborations with the acclaimed rhythm section of bassist Viktor Krauss and drummer Jim Keltner (Gone, Just Like a Train, Good Dog, Happy Man). Other releases include an album with Nashville musicians (Nashville), the solo album Ghost Town, an album of his arrangements of songs by Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach (The Sweetest Punch), a trio album with jazz legends Dave Holland and Elvin Jones, and a collection of American traditional songs and original compositions inspired by them entitled The Willies. The Intercontinentals, nominated for a Grammy in 2004 is an album that combines Frisell\u2019s own brand of American roots music and his unmistakable improvisational style with the influences of Brazilian, Greek, and Malian sounds. His 2004 release, entitled Unspeakable, produced by Hal Wilner, won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. East/West is a two CD set, featuring his two working trios recorded in concert on both coasts. Bill Frisell, Ron Carter, Paul Motian features two jazz legends that Bill considers among his true mentors and musical inspirations. His collaborative project Floratone (Blue Note) with drummer Matt Chamberlain and producers Lee Townsend & Tucker Martine, was described by All About Jazz as \u201ca modern masterpiece.\u201d History, Mystery was nominated for a Grammy award in Best Instrumental Jazz category, featuring an octet of strings, horns and rhythm section with some of his closest music collaborators exploring a fuller palette of compositional colors and timbres than any he has previously written for. \u201cThe whole album stands as yet another testament to the man's place at the very epicenter of modern American music.\" - BBC. The recent collection titled The Best of Bill Frisell, Vol 1: Folk Songs is the first in a series of compilations, this one drawn from Frisell's catalog spotlighting his idiosyncratic excursions into country and traditional folk. His latest album, \u201cDisfarmer\u201d, was inspired by the photographer Mike Disfarmer. It was described by the Houston Chronicle as follows: \"Frisell's pacing is magnificent, and the album sweeps along with purpose like a gorgeous, spacious epic. It is full of sounds that suggest settings and characters, including the mysterious eccentric who inspired the recording.\"\n\n\n\nBeginning in 2008, a trilogy of Frisell\u2019s music DVD\u2019s was released. First was Solos, shot in Toronto in high definition. Following in 2009, were the long awaited Films of Buster Keaton, Music By Bill Frisell featuring Frisell\u2019s original trio, Kermit Driscoll on bass and Joey Baron on drums as well as Live From Montreal, shot at the Montreal Jazz Festival in 2002 and featuring Matt Chamberlain on drums, Billy Drewes on alto saxophone, Curtis Fowlkes on trombone, Ron Miles on cornet and Greg Leisz on steel guitars. It showcases the music of Frisell\u2019s celebrated album, Blues Dream.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Frisell was named a USA Rasmuson Fellow and became a recipient of a grant offered by United States Artists, a privately funded organization dedicated to the support of America's finest living artists.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Elizabeth Moen", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8826937.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Sun Jan 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-26", "Genre": "Genres: Folk-rock, Indie, Indie Pop, Indie Rock, Soul, Folk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Bottom Of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "With a sultry and intoxicating voice, Elizabeth Moen lures you in. Paired with introspective lyrics that echo both bitter and sweet, her music will captivate you then stay with you. \u201cMoen is one of those rare artists whose voice, from the first moment you hear it, consumes your entire being, doing away with all previous thoughts and concerns, and leaving you short of breath (The Culture Trip).\u201d\n\nOn her sophomore LP A Million Miles Away, Moen tackles the complexities that coincide with the basic need for growth. At points lighthearted and somber, and even wry, her lyrics mirror what it's like to be alive: to wake up each day and attempt to balance the myriad of emotions that go along with being human. In \"Triple Scoop\" this all perfectly comes together in relation to the age-old problem of sweet, melting ice cream meeting concrete (\"Triple scoop sorbet splattered on the sidewalk / Bit of cherry pie hanging off your lip / Why wipe it away, it's just you and me talking? You're the cherry on top of my double chocolate chip\"). Throughout the album's eight songs, you are reminded that it's possible (and ok!) to feel broken and carefree, nostalgic and hopeful, to be utterly content but still have an incredible sense of longing.\n\nHailing from the small town of Vinton, Iowa located in the middle of the heartland, Moen taught herself how to play guitar as a teenager. It was peer pressure that caused her to write her first song and shortly thereafter, she immersed herself in the writing community of Iowa City while finishing up her studies in French and Spanish at the University of Iowa. Inspired by a mix of modern artists such as Alabama Shakes, Sharon Van Etten, Angel Olsen and Lake Street Dive (who she has supported), and older influences like Stevie Nicks and Joni Mitchell, Moen isn\u2019t locked into a single style.\n\nOn A Million Miles Away her songs shift fluidly; Opener \u201cRed\u201d and \u201cBest I Can Do\u201d portray the soulful side of her voice while \u201cTriple Scoop\u201d and \u201cMatilda\u201d recall folky, summer pop. \u201cDon\u2019t Say I\u201d and \u201cBad to Myself\u201d pull in heavier tones, augmented by her 1968 Gibson ES-340, while the final tracks, \u201cTime is a Shitty Friend\u201d and \u201cPlanetarium,\u201d act as closing arguments for the album. The two tracks encapsulate aspects of each preceding track, at times both heavy and soft - equal parts whimsy (\u201cCuz I\u2019m high and I\u2019m reading about stars and shit\u201d) and sadness (\u201c...and it\u2019s feeding / My thoughts about us together in some other universe\u201d), while the echo of a longing to be \u201ca million miles away\u201d plays out.\n\nA Million Miles Away follows Moen\u2019s 2016 (self-titled EP) and 2017 (That\u2019s All I Wanted LP) releases that took her on tour throughout the Midwest and Western United States alongside Europe. During this time she has acted as direct support for Lake Street Dive, Margaret Glaspy, Lucy Dacus, Houndmouth, William Elliott Whitmore (featured on her 2017 LP), and has had her music placed in films including the Netflix original movie \u201cCandy Jar.\u201d In support of her new album, Moen will embark on her first national headlining tour with dates in major cities including Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Denver, and Nashville. The tour will kick off with a live set for Iowa Public Radio, the state\u2019s NPR affiliate.\n\nDue to release September 1, Moen\u2019s new album is a testament to its theme: growth. A Million Miles Away is a moving, passionate exploration of internal and external change. In Moen\u2019s own words, \u201cthe base of the eight tracks revolves around the idea that there needs to be and will be growth. That can be for someone you love, for yourself, for a new relationship, or for closure from an old one. I\u2019ve grown a lot writing these. I hope that these songs will make you feel that way or another too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoen transfigures folk into an experience in the totality of instruments. But her vocals never shy away from the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d -Little Village\n\n\u201cElizabeth is armed with a jaw-dropping singing voice, tasteful guitar playing, and songs that stay in your head for days.\u201d -IPR (NPR)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1350 3rd St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Big Head Todd and The Monsters", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8268907.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.287516, 38.296479], "Date": "Sun Jan 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-26", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Uptown Theatre Napa", "moreBioInfo": "Big Head Todd and the Monsters are not that big on anniversaries, so there won\u2019t be any big hoopla over the fact that the band is officially crossing the three-decade mark this year. Thirty years would seem like something to commemorate, especially with the same core lineup, an achievement few other name-brand bands can boast of. Yet right now they\u2019re less about celebrating stability than volatility, in the form of their eleventh studio album, New World Arisin\u2019, which makes good on its forward-facing title with what might be the brashest rock and roll of their career. The old world can\u2019t rest on any laurels, and neither will they. \u201cWe\u2019re in a real exciting part of our career right now,\u201d says co-founder Todd Park Mohr. \u201cWe\u2019re a viable band with a great audience and we\u2019re able to work at a very high level. It\u2019s a career that\u2019s getting more and more interesting, rather than less, which is remarkable,\u201d he says, chuckling at the unlikelihood of anyone being this cheerfully all-in, this far in. \u201cI mean, 30 years into it, I really feel like: Wow, this is getting fun. I\u2019m learning more about music and about my instrument, and it\u2019s just really engaging in every way. We also dovetail well with the times, I think; I feel like we have something to say.\u201d That desire to communicate and connect is very much reflected in a new album that explores a variety of subgenres, from the funky (\u201cTrip\u201d) to the unexpectedly punky (\u201cDetonator\u201d), with stops along the way for raging country-rock (\u201cDamaged One\u201d), expansive storytelling in the Van Morrison/early Springsteen mode (\u201cWipeout Turn\u201d), a Jimi Hendrix cover (\u201cRoom Full of Mirrors\u201d), and, in the title track, \u201cNew World Arisin\u2019,\u201d a Charley Patton-inspired tune that ended up having what Mohr describes as \u201ca heavy metal/gospel feel.\u201d He doesn\u2019t feel these musical zigzags will give fans musical whiplash. \u201cThe fact is, most people, like myself, listen to multiple genres of music, so I don\u2019t think people have a problem with variety. I love it.\u201d But if there\u2019s a dominant musical motif to New World Arisin\u2019, it\u2019s \u201cstraight-up rock-pop,\u201d says Mohr. That contemporary approach might come as a slight surprise to hardcore fans that saw the Monsters take a seriously rootsy turn or two in the last 10 years. The band embarked on a side project, dubbed Big Head Blues Club, that saw them paying homage to Robert Johnson and bringing in venerable guest collaborators like Charlie Musselwhite and the late B.B. King. The heavy blues influence that dominated their alter-ego band carried over some into the last actual Big Head Todd and the Monsters album, 2014\u2019s Black Beehive. That element isn\u2019t altogether missing in New World Arisin\u2019; you\u2019ll certainly hear it recur in \u201cLong Coal Train.\u201d But this time the blues take a definite back seat to the unapologetically mainstream instincts that had Big Head Todd going platinum in the mid-\u201990s with the album Sister Sweetly, which spawned the rock radio hits \u201cBroken Hearted Savior,\u201d \u201cBittersweet,\u201d and \u201cCircle.\u201d \u201cCommercial success is still a goal for me and for our band,\u201d Mohr says, \u201cas far as the sense of communicating to, or striking a chord with a large number of people. We feel like we have something to say and something to offer the culture.\u201d Plus, a true confession: \u201cI\u2019m interested in the pop song! And I think \u2018Damaged One,\u2019 for one, is a classic pop song. Our label would have killed for that song, back then,\u201d in the wake of those mainstream radio hits that established the band. \u201cThey begged me to write it! So there\u2019s a lot of irony in our coming back to that.\u201d The history of the group actually stretches farther back from the 1987 point at which they took their name. The core members came together at such an early age that it\u2019s hard to know exactly how many candles to put on their collective cake. \u201cIt\u2019s murky,\u201d Mohr says, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve been playing with Brian (Nevin, their drummer) since junior high school, so the two of us go back to 1982. Brian and I played a talent show with Rob (Squires, the bass player) in 1983, and then we continued to plug at it, at a kids\u2019 pace,\u201d he laughs. They began playing original music in earnest in a nascent Colorado music scene that then consisted almost entirely of cover bands. A debut album, Another Mayberry, arrived in 1989, though it would be another four years before Sister Sweetly made them a national phenomenon. The only personnel change in these three decades has been the addition of a fourth member, putative \u201cnew guy\u201d Jeremy Lawton, in 2004. While they enjoy a robust fan base around the country, their success is outsized in Colorado, where they\u2019re practically the unofficial state band. That\u2019s evident in their ability to sell out Red Rocks, the most revered amphitheater in the nation, where they\u2019ve headlined 19 times. It also comes into play when the band gets asked to be a part of commemorative moments: Mohr recently sang the national anthem at a Rockies game, and the entire band took part in the parade through Denver after the Broncos took the Super Bowl. Their honors extend beyond their home state and even home country\u2026 into space. In 2005, they released the single \u201cBlue Sky,\u201d a tribute to the space program, written at the behest of crew members taking to the heavens aboard the space shuttle Discovery; it was performed years later as a live wake-up call to the astronauts on the shuttle. The song had enough appeal back on earth, too, that it was picked up by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008 and used to introduce her keynote speech to the Democratic convention. That campaign usage didn\u2019t come about as a result of any desire on Mohr\u2019s part to take the band in a political direction. He\u2019s not so interested in getting Big Head Todd and the Monsters caught up in that particular fray as looking at the smaller and bigger pictures, wanting to keep the material topical in some far deeper fashion. \u201cOur audience is America, and I\u2019m guessing it breaks down to the same percentages the country itself has,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve never gotten in the business of polarizing people politically. But at the same time, as artists, it\u2019s our job to observe and to hopefully find some insight. I\u2019ve always been interested in the human condition more than politics. Politics are a part of it, but I always look at conflict as personal before it\u2019s political. And I would consider conflict my dominant lyrical theme now\u2014 how people are trapped in it, and how conflict relates to intimacy and pleasure.\u201d A Big Head Todd show, in any case, is a place where those conflicts might resolve, or dissolve. \u201cIn talking about our apolitical-ness, I think unity is an important thing,\u201d Mohr says. \u201cBeing a human being, you have a lot in common with other human beings, and why not maximize those things? Music has an incredible capacity to convey other cultures and times, and to create a lot of empathy and togetherness. There\u2019s harmony in it, and it implies oneness \u2014 the root.\u201d There\u2019s an economy to the songs on the new album, most of which clock in around four minutes, and sometimes even closer to three. You\u2019d think this would make Big Head Todd and the Monsters the farthest thing from a jam band. Yet they have a fervent following among that subset of rock fans, lack of noodling notwithstanding. Maybe it\u2019s because of the changing nature of their set lists, since the Monsters are known to take requests, both in person and online. \u201cOur focus has always been on serving the song,\u201d Mohr says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t historically been that jammy. Which isn\u2019t to say that we don\u2019t have an occasional six-minute number -- we do. But having said that, I have a great respect for that audience, which I think is just a music-loving audience. You know, one year I got invited to the Jammies at Carnegie Hall, and I got in a discussion with somebody: \u2018Well, how do you define a jam band?\u2019 And he told me, \u2018A jam band doesn\u2019t repeat a song for three shows in a row.\u2019 That was the only way that he would define it. I could almost follow that rule, except there are probably four songs I have to play every night. So I guess those four songs are what\u2019s keeping us from ever being a jam band,\u201d he laughs. What\u2019s clear is that Big Head Todd is one multi-headed rock monster, easily traversing the most accessible hooks and the heaviest grooves. It\u2019s not surprising that they would appeal to any audience or sub-audience that values durability over flavors of the moment. But Mohr has to laugh when he thinks about how little the possibility of long-term perseverance was on the members\u2019 minds 30 years ago. \u201cWhen you form, I think your goal is to make it through the party on Saturday night,\u201d he points out. \u201cIn art, longevity isn\u2019t the goal. It\u2019s a happy accident if it happens, and I think ours was one of those convenient accidents that led to a happy marriage. But we happen to get along really well and love being with each other and playing music for a living.\u201d Simple as it may sound, that\u2019s a profound recipe for endurance in both the old world and the new.

With the NGDB he has played over 8,500 shows - and performed 2500+ solo in addition to that - and flown 3 million miles to do it. McEuen has performed on over 300 television shows. At the end of the 50th NGDB tour John left the group to fill the demand for his own shows and solo work.\n\nHis recent Made in Brooklyn album on the prestigious Chesky Records - with many star performers sitting in - was Stereophile Magazine's Record of the Month.\n\nOne of his particular points of pride has been performing on the Grand Ole Opry - featured numerous times solo, and as a guest with several other Opry member acts; he brought Steve Martin there in 2010 for the Opry debut of The Crow. But his highest point on the Opry was playing it with sons Jonathan and Nathan, which they have done twice .\n\nIn 1971 John initiated what Rolling Stone called 'the' most important record to come out of Nashville, and what the 2004 ZAGAT survey called the most important record in country music, \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken.\" Asking both Earl Scruggs and then (10 days later) Doc Watson if they would record with the band was followed by his brother Bill lining up Merle Travis. This started the ball rolling and shortly Louise Scruggs then helped line up, at their request, Jimmy Martin, Maybelle Carter, and Roy Acuff..Earl Scruggs secured Vassar Clements and Junior Huskey, and the NGDB went to Nashville in August of '71 to make what would become an historic album, released on United Artists Records in spring of 1972.\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist (banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle) and solo entertainer, John McEuen plays to the boomer/'old hippie' crowd and the traditional/bluegrass and folk audience, as well as the older country audience... and now the younger group is showing up to see 'where it all came from'.\n\nJohn has made over 40 albums (six solo) that have earned four platinum and four gold recognition awards, Grammy nominations and awards, CMA and ACM awards, Western Heritage Award, Emmy nomination, and IBMA record of the year award. In addition, John has performed on another 25 albums as guest artist. As 'a presenter', McEuen has produced over 250 concerts (his first one was Bob Dylan in 1965 at a long Beach high school).\n\nJohn has known and worked with Steve Martin since high school years to the present. They both worked in Disneyland's Magic Shop as teenagers. John scored Steve's television specials, and arranged his music; Recently, John's production of Steve's album The Crow - New Songs for the five-string banjo won the Grammy for Best Bluegrass album.\n\nJohn's own XM Satellite radio show, Acoustic Traveller on The Bridge, runs twice a month and is in its 10th year.\n\nMcEuen created the music scores for 14 film/television projects, including the Emmy nominated 10-hour mini-series for Warner Bros. 'The Wild West.'\n\\\nJohn is also CEO of SyndicatedNews.Net\n\nJohn has also raised his six kids (five boys and a girl) ages between 38-48, and a 34-year-old stepson.\n\nSome of the artists John McEuen has performed or recorded with include: Dolly Parton, Steve Martin, Willie Nelson, Bill Wyman, Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash, Jerry Garcia, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Phish, Jerry Jeff Walker, Kevin Nealon, Alison Krauss, Bill Cosby, Stephen Wright, Mark OConnor, Tommy Lee Jones, Sissy Spacek, Linda Ronstadt, Leon Russell, Maybelle Carter, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Steve Vai, Doc Watson, Jimmy Buffett, The Smothers Brothers, Rowan & Martin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Bobby Sherman, Jose Feliciano, Allman Brothers, John Denver, Roy Acuff, Earl Scruggs, Jack Benny, Glen Campbell, Steve Goodman, Waylon Jennings, Robin Williams, Little River Band, Marshall Tucker Band, Doobie Brothers, Andy Williams, Merle Travis, Vassar Clements, Dizzy Gillespie, The Osmond Brothers, Everly Brothers, Crystal Gayle, Gary Morris, Doug Kershaw, Michael Martin Murphey, The Doors, Donovan, Lee Marvin, Ramblin Jack Elliot, David Amram, Arlo Guthrie, America, Bill Monroe, and Asleep at the Wheel and dozens more...\n\nA large percentage of his performances now include multi-media, as he goes out as described below:\n\nMcEuen - brings his banjo, guitar, fiddle, and mandolin - to share his music and memories of his 55-year life in music.

In 2008, while continuing his training as a healer, Jimmy set out to find the right players for The Love Dimension.\n\nIn January 2009, Jimmy played a solo acoustic show as The Love Dimension at a dive bar in San Francisco. Local club gigs followed with a rotating line-up supporting Jimmy (guitar/vocals), Celeste Obomsawin (vocals/percussion/flute) and Raphael Wayman Davis (bass). During its first two years, the band recorded its first album, In Between Lives (2011) and several EPs and singles. Then tragedy struck with the untimely death of bass player Raphael. The next few years saw several different band lineups and the release of several recordings including albums Forget the Remember (2012) and Create and Consume (2014).\n\nThe Love Dimension\u2019s core lineup is Jimmy L.

Chad has toured across the globe as a soloist and with many esteemed jazz artists, including Arturo O\u2019Farrill and Clarence Penn.\n\n\n\nA native of Elmira, New York, Chad established himself as a jazz prodigy at age 11, performing throughout New York State under the mentorship of local jazz hero, George Reed, who was known for backing legends like Teddy Wilson, Buddy Tate, and Marian McPartland.\n\n\n\nChad went on to pursue a formal education in the arts at the Brubeck Institute, a prestigious fellowship program created by jazz legend Dave Brubeck. While studying at the institute, he performed regularly with Brubeck and was a member of the Brubeck Institute Jazz Quintet.\n\n\n\nChad received many accolades during his scholastic career, including 15 DownBeat Magazine Student Music Awards for categories such as \"Best Jazz Soloist\" and \"Best Original Song.\"\n\n\n\nSince graduating from the Brubeck Institute, Chad has performed throughout four continents, and has appeared at venues including Carnegie Hall, the Super Bowl, and Madison Square Garden.

The award-winning independent singer-songwriter, mixer, and producer downloaded a trial version of Ableton, taught herself the program and hand-stitched every note of her 2019 third full-length Garden.\n\nAs part of her vision, swaths of shimmering nostalgic eighties synths offset a decidedly 21st century take on heartache that proves both entrancing and empowering.\n\n\u201cI never realized how much more I could really say with my music by producing,\u201d she explains. \u201cNow, I have all the creative power. If something doesn\u2019t have the right color,\u201d the singer says, referencing her synesthesia, \u201cI can change it. The music I\u2019m creating feels like the most me it\u2019s ever been because I rejected how everyone else said I\u2019m supposed to do things.\u201d\n\nA \u201csad\u201d childhood in her hometown of Bozeman, Montana, marred by conflict and chaos at home, bullies at school, bouts with hypochondria, and years of therapy thrust Charlee into the arms of music. Post-high school, she spent six months in Nashville before moving back to Montana after self-producing and releasing the These Veins EP in 2014. Relocating to Los Angeles, the Bright White Trims LP followed during 2015 and the Saints Until Fridays EP arrived a year later. In the aftermath of her \u201cfirst real breakup,\u201d 2018\u2019s Sad Girl Music turned heads as her total streams passed 1 million on Spotify, and she staked out real estate on coveted playlists such as \u201cNew Music Friday.\u201d\n\nIn addition to acclaim from Alternative Press, Earmilk, EDM Sauce, she landed syncs on shows across Bravo and E!. Gaining newfound confidence by taking the reins as producer, she laid the soil for Garden embracing formative influences ranging from The Secret Garden to Tears For Fears and the soundtracks to Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved gardens,\u201d she says. \u201cIn England, gardens are overcast and rainy. Every color is dark, moody, ambient, versus the usual bright and in-your-face Alice in Wonderland trope. Life isn\u2019t like that. It gets really depressing at times and I felt like an English moor better mirrored all the aching I was feeling and all the flowers I was growing. But growth is subtle--healing is subtle. Much like planting the seeds for a garden, it\u2019s slow, it tests your patience, it makes you question everything and then it blooms all at once. I don\u2019t know where the 80s thing came into it. The 80s romanticized such simple things like a mailbox in golden hour, paper routes in the morning, drinking on the lake. I wanted to write an album that magnified the beauty of suburbia and sounded like the soundtrack to a young adult novel\u2026adapted into a NETFLIX movie. I wanted to write the sounds you\u2019d hear while you watched some young heroine riding her bike in a miraculous coming-of-age story. \u201d\n\nThis sound crystallizes over the course of Garden. She initially teased out the record with the glimmering and glitchy \u201cHeartbreak Daily\u201d where warm synths entwine with sweeping vocal transmissions. The follow-up \u201cPortland\u201d paired lithe acoustic guitar with Pacific Northwest road trip recollections of \u201ctwo broken hearts in a rented car.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the single \u201cPretty Genius\u201d blossoms from cavernous keystrokes into a declaration of purpose as our narrator \u201cembraces her superpowers instead of hiding them to make insecure men feel better.\u201d Then, there\u2019s \u201cNothing Blooms Quite Like Heartache.\u201d Airy percussion and booming synths directly \u201ctie into the garden theme where growth requires patience and sadness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve been preaching forever is it\u2019s okay, and actually important, to be sad,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cDetach yourself from emotions that don\u2019t serve you, like guilt or shame, and marry the ones that do. Happiness is an internal thing. It\u2019s something you can obtain only when you go below the surface and look inside of yourself to see what\u2019s there holding you back.\u201d", "otherInfo": "18+\n\nDoors @ 7:15\n\nCome help Charlee and Melanie celebrate the releases of Charlee's upcoming LP, \"Garden\" and Melanie's debut EP, \"Context.\""}, {"Address": "2174 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "King Willow", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7539639.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.430418, 37.766622], "Date": "Wed Jan 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-29", "Genre": "Genres: Indie pop, folk, rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Du Nord", "moreBioInfo": "Sisters Amanda and Julianna Salguero make up the twin chambers of King Willow\u2019s wistfully beating heart.

At the age of eight, Gipcia enrolled Ariel and his brother Sandro in, \"La Casa De La Cultura\" (Cultural House) where he developed his artistic vision through painting. Sandro on the other hand, began with music. For 7 years \"La Casa De La Cultura\", provided the venue for Ariel to compete in various art shows and contests. At the age of fifteen, Ariel\u2019s dreams of becoming the next Picasso were thwarted when he was rejected by the national art school, \u201cInstituto de Arte, San Alejandro.\u201d He stopped painting\u2026\n\nOne day Ariel woke up inspired and asked Sandro to teach him some songs; Sandro did. After a near obsession with perfecting scales and melodies, Arioel began composing original score. At twenty two Ariel had about 20 songs. Eager to create a space where young artists could share their passions, Ariel co-founded the, \u201cPe\u00f1a de la Trova\", at his church. This forum was a weekly open mic for dancers, singers and artists to practice perform and share with the community. From 2000 until 2002, Ariel broadened his scope of audience to various cafes, and became a member of the \" Asociaci\u00f3n HERMANOS SAIZ,\u201d thereby becoming a member of the Novisima Trova Movement.\n\nIt was during those years, Ariel had the opportunity to record his first album, \u201cNo Quiero Morir,\u201d(2001) in one of Habana\u2019s best theaters, Amadeo Roldan. He gathered the best musicians he knew, Cuban and international alike.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

While attending college, Tim began to experiment with guitar. He became especially fascinated with song-writing and recording. He began co-writing and recording and producing with the New Jersey based band Dog Show Blues. During this time he also worked on what would later become his debut album.

His bedroom demos have earned substantial play on vanguard public radio station KCRW 89.9 FM, he\u2019s recorded and played throughout North America and Europe, and he performed for several thousand people over dozens of sold out London residency shows in partnership with the singer Laura Marling. In fact, while recording a live EP with Marling in 2013, he realized that the way to make a record was to strip the process down, to get at essence of the song. And now he\u2019s finally releasing his debut album that does just that. It\u2019s a stunning 10-song set that handles his world-wise observations as sacred, profound texts. The wait was worthwhile. \u201cIt does feel like an eternity of building up and having this stuff, waiting,\u201d Berman admits. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief.\u201d That protracted process hasn\u2019t made Berman\u2014or his music, at least\u2014impatient in the least. Instead, his perfectly tempered tenor winds through these austere arrangements, his assured fingerpicking providing the backbone for supporting piano and sighing lap steel, pillow-soft harmonies and blossoming trombone. Recorded by producer and former Rilo Kiley multi-instrumentalist Pierre De Reeder in his Los Angeles studio Kingsize North, Berman and his supporting cast cut these tunes in only two days. The tight timeframe didn\u2019t give them time to overthink the arrangements or to fret over every point of possible imperfection. These tunes, then, feel lived-in and human\u2014ever appropriate, as they are stark and honest examinations of the impulses, neuroses and desires that push each of us from one day and into the next. \u201cSome of my favorite records are recorded that way\u2014people sitting in a room, capturing what they capture. There\u2019s going to be a creaking chair. A solo isn\u2019t going to be perfect. You\u2019re not going to sing that line the way you\u2019d planned it. But I love that,\u201d says Berman. \u201cWhy would you overcomplicate these things?\u201d The obvious lure comes early in the record with a slow-motion take on \u201cLike a Rolling Stone.\u201d It\u2019s Berman\u2019s follow-up duet with Marling after they delivered a devastatingly seductive take of Springsteen\u2019s \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d on his anticipation-baiting Blood & Rust EP. Berman\u2019s voice trickles like a leaky faucet of worry, bending the anxiety and indignation of Dylan\u2019s words into an existential, intimate crisis. But Marling lifts him up, buoying his worry with generous harmonies. It\u2019s a stunning reinvention of a standard, the rare cover that acknowledges the original\u2019s intent but unabashedly augments it. Berman and Marling had planned on recording an obscure cut, a Bonnie \u201cPrince\u201d Billy B-side. While working on it, though, the pair stumbled into this take while Berman was teaching himself to write in a new guitar tuning. \u201cI asked Laura to sing one of the verses, because if she doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s just six-and-half minutes of me singing Dylan,\u201d Berman says. \u201cThat\u2019s not so enchanting.\u201d The result is enchanting, but it\u2019s also just the start, a premonition of the wisdom and reckoning that Berman wraps into his own songs. During \u201cHamlet, Accidentally,\u201d for instance, Berman makes woe seem graceful, even necessary, as he extends his most magnetic chorus over stretched accordion chords and lilting picking. \u201cPolyhymnia\u201d is a yearning plea for inspiration, a secret transmission from a seeker in search not only of some universal truth but also for a way to share what he\u2019s found. The brimming and bracing \u201cAvalon\u201d extols the uncertainty of that shared, lifelong quest. All of those feelings funnel into closer \u201cWherever We Go,\u201d a song about survival in spite of the elements and one another\u2019s misdeeds. Berman\u2019s band backs him with gospel-like antiphony, and the tune becomes a hymn for solidarity. \u201cHow you gonna sail/safely through the storm?\u201d he asks, the ensemble repeating him before joining for the triumphant answer. \u201cHand in hand, we\u2019ll keep each other warm.\u201d And that\u2019s the promise and the delivery of Berman\u2019s long-in-the-making debut. It\u2019s an album that asks difficult questions about life, frames them with the smarts and experiences of someone who\u2019s lived and learned and worked, and ultimately suggests a way forward. \u201cI am inextricably bound to this thing, to writing and playing these songs,\u201d Berman explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away from it, and that\u2019s not necessarily easy. But that\u2019s what fed these songs.\u201d Eddie Berman releases his debut LP on October 21, 2014. Eddie\u2019s band currently consists of: Eddie Berman (Gutiar/Banjo/Vocals), Gabe Feenberg (Accordion/Lap Steel/Horn/Piano), Sarah Pigion (Harmonium/Piano/Vocals), Gabe Davis (Upright Bass), Polly Hall (Fiddle) Before The Bridge - 2017 OUT NOW!

The triple-guitar attack and rhythmic dexterity of Periphery has won them devoted adherents across underground subcultures, regardless of whether those fans were weaned on the passion-fueled sounds of the Vans Warped Tour or the progressive rock of Rush. A clear contender for \u201cBreakthrough Band\u201d at Metal Hammer\u2019s 2013 Golden Gods Awards and frequent tourmates of Meshuggah, Dream Theater, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Animals As Leaders and other ultra-shred-happy friends and contemporaries from across the spectrum of loud rock, Periphery have earned their reputation onstage and off through a combination of undeniable chops and upbeat charisma. The Clear EP represents the sum total of Periphery\u2019s unrivaled achievement and the promise of what\u2019s to come courtesy of seven tracks most bands would be extremely grateful to see comprise a full LP. Periphery II: This Time Its Personal made Guitar World\u2019s 2012 \u201cBest Of\u201d list. Clear is undoubtedly destined to turn heads, as well. Born in an era where cookie-cutter musical constructs and fame-driven scene pretenders dominated the album and touring landscape, Periphery immediately rose to the fore with their dedication to unique artistry, musicianship and melody. The band steadfastly refuses to submit to the humorlessness that often plagues metal, particularly metal bands whose players possess such massive skill. They\u2019ve put serious focus on their music, enabling them to share a laugh in presentation. \u201cIcarus Lives!,\u201d \u201cMake Total Destroy,\u201d \u201cScarlet\u201d and like-minded Periphery jams have racked up millions of YouTube views and digital downloads, inspired massive amounts of air-guitar and air-drumming in clubs and theatres around the world and driven attention to the band\u2019s instant genre-classic pair of full-length albums. Periphery and Periphery II: This Time It\u2019s Personal galvanized a new generation of heavy music fans, many of whom have been as likely to scramble for guitar tabs to decode the inscrutable polyrhythms as they are to bruise themselves in the moshpit. Initially the brainchild of producer, solo artist and Guitar World cover star Misha Mansoor, the Washington D.C. based musical collective has since grown into a wild beast that belonging to their fiercely dedicated group of fans as much as to the band. Mansoor is joined by fellow axe wizards Jake Bowen and Mark Holcomb; viciously proficient bass slinger and production minded maestro Adam \u201cNolly\u201d Getgood; monstrous SickDrummer.com staple Matt Halpern; and Spencer Sotelo, who singularly manages to make heads or tails of Periphery\u2019s mindboggling music, inviting newcomers into the band\u2019s world via counter-intuitively catchy vocals. The broader populace is joining the party, too. Periphery debuted at #2 on Billboard\u2019s \u201cHeatseekers\u201d chart, with the follow-up album breaking into Billboard\u2019s Top 50 just two years later. Periphery II: This Time It\u2019s Personal introduced Holcomb and Getgood to the world at large and boasted guest appearances from Dream Theater co-founder John Petrucci, English guitar virtuoso and YouTube star Guthrie Govan (The Aristocrats, ex-Asia) and labelmate Wes Hauch (The Faceless). Like \u201cThe Big 4\u201d of Thrash, the Floridian death metal merchants, early Metalcore pioneers, mathcore inventors and deathcore standard bearers, Periphery\u2019s influence is so pervasive that they are often identified as the singularly most important band in the \u201cdjent\u201d subgenre. The group has taken this distinction in humorous stride (see \u201cDjent Reznor\u201d; \u201cLeague of Extraordinary Djentlemen\u201d; etc.), but to saddle them with one particular genre description would be a great disservice to all Periphery has to offer. Boundary pushing experimentalism, nuanced mathematical cacophony and complex grooves that are alternately engaging and innovative are just the tip of the iceberg for the six-piece monstrosity, who are truly only now getting started.

Can a song be so intensely personal that it somehow manages to reach beyond itself towards something universal?

Having won numerous songwriting awards from industry mainstays like the Kerrville Folk Festival and American Songwriter Magazine, and garnered nods and admiration from both Miranda Lambert and her fellow writers in the Nashville underground, Caroline has delivered a record to meet the expectation: Quite simply, 11 songs of gorgeous Americana that remind us of why we fell in love with the genre in the first place.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s is a rare but unmistakable authenticity and emotional resonance that can't be faked, all delivered from a voice that somehow manages to be both ethereally pristine and yet profoundly raw and human-- a disarming union of self-assuredness and vulnerability that runs throughout the record. Under the guidance of Producer Neilson Hubbard, \"Spades and Roses\" strips away all of the sonic barriers that might stand between Caroline and her listener, allowing her fragile melodies and first person confessionals to do their work-- reaching out and empathizing, providing a soundtrack to our own hidden stories. Every song on the record--whether pop or meditative, glib or heartbreaking-- asks the essential question of whether or not the listener can recognize himself.\n\n\n\nWhether it\u2019s a song like \"Southern Accident,\" a strikingly personal and heartbreaking account of the lingering effects of her parents divorce on her own search for love and commitment, or \"Softball,\" an extended anthemic metaphor for the all-to-real injustices of the gender gap in modern life, Spades and Roses is Caroline's unflinching testimony and reminder as to why songs are important: It\u2019s about paying attention. It's about whether you can take a handful of chords and find those still points of peace and clarity and joy amidst the basic confusion, struggles, and emotional wreckage of our everyday lives.

In between tours, Sweeney was working on the songs that would make up the album Peace Meal from an apartment overlooking the Pacific Ocean as well as Faraway Sound in Brooklyn, NY. The goal was to make this record quickly, before questions on the meaning of it all could reach him. Then, on a fateful night in April 2018, just as the final mixes for the album were being completed, an astrological grip intercepted Sweeney\u2019s life when he awoke to find his infant daughter no longer breathing and the toughest of life\u2019s questions falling all around him.\nA \u201cpillar of San Francisco's garage-psych community\u201d (TheBayBridged), Luke Sweeney has been a working musician for over a decade, playing with a wide variety of cohorts such as Tim Cohen (Fresh & Onlys), Tyson Vogel (Two Gallants), and Healing Potpourri. His personal output has always sparked interest among the interesting - an artist\u2019s artist, so to speak - as he \u201cconfounds aural expectations and puts the knock on reverence\u2026 with time-worn allusions to psychedelia, bubblegum, glam, and mellow Seventies balladry\u201d (Austin Chronicle) and \u201ca kaleidoscopic whoosh of psych-pop, indie-folk, lo-fi soul and futuristic blues\u201d (Bend Bulletin). Now, while those muses are still very present in his approach, the arrival of Peace Meal feels like something of a rebirth. Perhaps the songs were the fruit of a communicative collaboration between this plane of existence and another; Sweeney says the lyrics to \u2018Great Wide Ocean\u2019, written on the studio floor long before his daughter Rishi was conceived, came to him as if sent from another realm.\nMeanwhile, breezy melodies and buoyant beats soundtrack what is musically Sweeney\u2019s most pop-oriented album to date: \"It is easy to hear why this album has a healing quality for Sweeney; Peace Meal digs deep and balances a strong introspective slant with melodies reaching out for listeners and inviting them into its musical world. It deserves consideration as his finest work yet\" (Too Much Love). Moving forward and getting back on the proverbial horse, Sweeney had these words to offer - \u201dWhen the wheel stops spinning and the gears fall apart, the consciousness of the artist comes alive and puts a beat back into our collective heart.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Tony Hannah\n&\nLuke Sweeney (solo)\nlive at Papermill Creek Saloon"}, {"Address": "23 Petaluma Blvd N, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "The King Street Giants", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.640098, 38.233411], "Date": "Thu Jan 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Mystic Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors 6:30pm // Show 7:30pm // All Ages // $12 Students & $20 Adults"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Covet", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8208616.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Thu Jan 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-30", "Genre": "Genres: Instrumental Rock, Progressive Rock, Adventure Rock, Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "We a three friends that love to travel and make music!\n\nYvette Young-Guitars\nDavid Adamiak-Bass\nForrest Rice-Drums", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Thursday January 16.

Don\u2019t get me wrong I love a solid heartbreak tune, but I had never written anything else.\" admits Brent Cowles, as he described the impetus for \"High to Low\", his brand new single available October 18th.\n\n\"I wanted to make people dance and smile\" he continued. So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll. Says Brent, \"It\u2019s a song about dancing like everyone is watching, and you don\u2019t give a damn.\"\n\nBlurring the lines between boisterous rock, R&B, and contemplative folk, Brent\u2019s infectious voice and knack for melody seem to swing effortlessly from quavering intimacy to a soulful roar as they soar atop his exuberant, explosive arrangements.\n\nGrowing up, Cowles first discovered the power of his voice singing hymns at his father\u2019s church in Colorado Springs. Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life. The Denver Post raved that the group created \u201csome of the most exciting original music in Colorado,\u201d while Westword proclaimed that their live show was a \u201cclinic in roots rock mixed with old-school swing and blues,\u201d and Seattle NPR station KEXP hailed \u201cCowles\u2019 Otis Redding and Sam Cooke inspired vocals.\u201d The band released two albums and toured nationally before they called it quits and amicably went their separate ways.\n\nThe parting was a necessary but difficult one for Cowles. In the ensuing months and years, he would find himself alone more than ever before, at one point living out of his Chevy Tahoe just to make ends meet. But rather than break him, the experience only strengthened his resolve. \"High to Low\u201d gives the listener a real sense of Brent\u2019s current mood. His songs are more evolved yet simpler, his lyrics are stronger yet fragile.

The Seattle-based trio\u2014Peter Richards on guitar and vocals, Claire England on bass and vocals, and Andrew Hall on drums\u2014is announcing itself with an album that couches its themes of anxiety and eroding mental health in rock tracks that amp up the sweetly melodic crunch of powerpop with massive distortion and bashed-to-heck drums. Sincerely is a loud, sweaty rebuke to those moments in life when it seems like nothing's working, a testament to the power of friendship, staring problems directly in the face, and finding solace in art.\n\nRichards, England, and Hall have been through a lot during their four years of playing together, and tracks like the speedy, dark \"Paralyzed,\" the Creedence-echoing \"Twin Moons,\" and the frustrated yet ebullient \"Something in The Way\" combines lyrics that play on the trio's travails with jumpy, riff-heavy distorto-pop. England handles lead vocal duties on the zinging kiss-off \"Tonight\" and the slowly grinding \"Love Is,\" the first time she's done so on a Dude York record. \"Times Not on My Side,\" an intimate farewell note sung atop jangling acoustic, caps the album.\n\nA first pass at a home-recorded version of Sincerely led to the band being told that there was \"drywall in every piece of [the record],\" says Hall, and they had to go back to the drawing board. Longtime Sleater-Kinney and Bikini Kill producer John Goodmanson and JR Slayer (aka The Blood Brothers\u2019 Cody Votolato) helped Dude York craft a record that captured the energy of their live show while finding new ways to expand upon its ideas.\n\nThe band\u2019s thoughtful approach to putting together Sincerely's songs echoes the album's overarching themes of almost-punishing inward focus.\n\n\"I feel like it's about losing perspective\u2014a spiraling-inward perspective despite what may be ready support networks around you,\" adds Richards. \"It's like, 'I don't need anybody's help. I should be able to do this myself, because it's just, like, living.'\"\n\nBringing England's straightforward drawl into the mix underscores that idea, and its contrast to Richards' excited yelp heightens the tension on Sincerely, a chaotic, yet ultimately triumphant album that's a vital tonic for these increasingly confused times.\n\n\"Your back's against the wall,\" says Richards, \"so all you can do is fight.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1317 San Pablo Ave, Berkeley, CA 94702", "Artist": "Army", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.295337, 37.880135], "Date": "Thu Jan 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-30", "Genre": "Genres: Reggae", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ashkenaz Music & Dance Community Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "More details coming soon!\nBerkeley\u2019s 7th Street Band has made its name backing some of the greats and new voices of reggae and running its own studio.

Their aim is to create soundscapes to tantalize the mind with the complexities of existence. They\u2019re genre unspecific. Their set can move from psychedelic instrumentation, to doom, to gypsy, to blues and anywhere in between.

She is a painter, a dreamer, a cat and coffee enthusiast, and lover of humans and their stories.\n\nRicky Woulfe offers the psychedelic electric guitar, rhythm and riffs spill out of his fingers and from his voice a siren sings.

Growing up in a family of musicians, Morgan was given his first pair of drumsticks at the age of six months, followed shortly thereafter by a drum set. By six, Morgan had his first saxophone. With his mother being a pianist and his father being a bassist, Morgan began playing piano and bass early on. His debut record \u201cThe Saga\u201d was released in 2016. It featured Guerin performing the majority of the instruments on the record. Since moving to New York in 2016 and attending the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, Morgan had the great fortune of joining Terri Lyne Carrington\u2019s band, \u201cSocial Science\u201d where he plays electric bass, saxophone and EWI in the group.\n\nThe Huffington Post named Morgan\u2019s first album, \u201cThe Saga\u201d one of the best Jazz albums of 2016 and Stereo Gum showcased his sophomore album, \u201cThe Saga II\u201d in their August article for their favorite albums. He has also been featured in Downbeat Magazine, New York Times and Burning Ambulance. In 2018, Jammcard selected Morgan as one of their \u201c20 under 20\u201d artists.\n\nMorgan now performs regularly with Terri Lyne Carrington and Social Science, Esperanza Spalding, Amina Figarova Sextet and Tyshawn Sorey.

It can also be the point of view of a story told in first person singular. When Norway\u2019s Immortal laid their instruments to rest in 2003 after seven full length albums and thirteen years as one of black metal\u2019s pioneering bands, the metal underground suffered a great loss. Disbanding on the grounds of purging themselves of burnout, the iconic and enigmatic Abbath Doom Occulta (Abbath for short; a.k.a. Olve Eikemo) can now admit to using the self-imposed hiatus for various noble causes. Although Abbath soon discovered that music was the element that could never be purged from his blood, it was during this period of personal growth that the icon became much more mortal. To maximize his time away from unhealthy old habits, he found a job in scaffolding, became more health-conscious, and spent more time with his son. Firing on all cylinders and seemingly rewarding himself for a job well done, he picked up his guitar again. Easing himself back into the music scene by way of a Mot\u00f6rhead tribute band named \u201cB\u00f6mbers,\u201d Abbath continued to write music on his own until the day he reached out to an old friend to lay down guitar solos over his rhythm tracks: current Enslaved guitarist Isdale (\u201cIce Dale\u201d). It was in this crucible of hard rock and black metal where I\u2019s creative fusion exploded. The inspiration was multi-faceted. Admittedly, the opening riff in \u201cThe Storm I Ride\u201d is a tribute to the KISS riff in \u201cLadies In Waiting\u201d from the Dressed To Kill album; the essence of live rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is plainly evident in \u201cCursed We Are\u201d; but above all else, Abbath insists the album\u2019s greatest musical influence is from Sweden\u2019s Bathory - thus, \u201cFar Beyond The Quiet\u201d is a tribute to the fallen mastermind Quorthon. Other muses include all seasons of Abbath\u2019s native Norway, and the peace-instilling properties of the countryside. \u201cAny backwards moves toward their roots are countered with climbing onto higher peaks of cleaner air and new kinds of frozen evil,\u201d cites Decibel Magazine, which scored Between Two Worlds a 9 out of 10. Featuring a super group line-up comprised of Arve \u201cIce Dale\u201d Isdal (Enslaved), ex-Gorgoroth bassist Tom Visnes (T.C. King), ex-Immortal drummer Armagedda, and showcasing the lyrical penmanship of ex-Immortal member Demonaz, Abbath wants to make the message clear that in the instance of this debut album, \u201cI\u201d denotes the Roman numeral \u201cOne,\u201d designating Between Two Worlds as the first of its kind in the new genre of rock-infused black metal.

As a teenager, though Drake was focusing on acting, he continued to play music and write songs on the side, and after a program he was in, Nickelodeon\u2019s The Amanda Show, was canceled in 2002, and a spinoff, The Drake and Josh Show, was started (it first aired in 2004), Bell was able to finally show off his chops onscreen, writing the theme song, \u201cFound a Way,\u201d and playing an exaggerated version of his guitarist self named Drake Parker.\n\n\n\nHeavily influenced by the Beatles and the Beach Boys, Drake released his debut, Telegraph, independently in 2005; soon after he signed to Universal, who put out his sophomore record, It\u2019s Only Time, the following year. The live album, Drake Bell in Concert, appeared in 2008 and it wouldn\u2019t be until 2011 that Drake would release any new material, with the stopgap EP A Reminder.\n\n\n\nReturning to the studio some two years later with childhood hero Brian Setzer, Drake released his third album, the rockabilly-inspired Ready Steady Go! on Surfdog Records in 2014. With music being his first love, Drake made the most rockin\u2019 and exciting album of his career \u2013 a collection of melodic pop, and at the same time hard-hitting rock n roll.\n\n\n\nIn 2014 Drake took Mexico by storm when he performed at Exa FM\u2019s \u201cConcierto Exa 2014\u201d in Mexico City for an audience of more than 50,000 people. His song \u201cBull\u201d remained in the Top 10 on Mexican radio for several weeks.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Drake returns to Mexico to perform live again for all his fans, with shows in Monterrey, Mexico City and Guadalajara.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1030 Main St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Larry Carlton", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617578.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Fri Jan 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-31", "Genre": "Genres: Smooth Jazz, Jazz", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Napa", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Full Food and Bar Menu Available in all sectionsLarry Carlton: Performing The Crusaders Remembered and 1978 Album Steely DanPick which showtime below for which one you want to see, or see him twice! 1.31.19:6:30 Show: Larry Carlton 1978 Album/Steely Dan9:00 Show: The Crusaders Remembered2.1.19:6:30 Show: The Crusaders Remembered9:00 Show: Larry Carlton 1978 Album/Steely DanMEET AND GREET AVAILABLE FOR ADD ONMUST HAVE A TICKET TO SHOW, Sold Separately.M&G includes a Q&A, Guitar tips with Larry and a photo opportunity.6:30 Show: M&G is Pre- Show @ 4:00 pm9:00 Show: M&G will be After the show.Ages 8+BLUE NOTE NAPA is located on the 1st floor of the Historic Napa Valley Opera House at 1030 Main St. We are an intimate 144-seat Live Music club and Restaurant, where you can enjoy performances of world renowned and local Bay Area artists alike.

He constructs a unique world, defines it, and then burns it to the ground. Truly unique and absolutely brilliant.\u201d \u2013All Music Guide\n\nIt\u2019s the ease with which he delivers conversational lyrics and honeyed melodies, a natural magic that is the soul of Tom Freund\u2019s music. Though he\u2019s widely-traveled in a variety of genres\u2013 from hearftelt folk to buoyant pop to boho jazz to straightforward rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and beyond \u2013Freund is, simply put, a singer-songwriter with a defined and captivating presence.\n\n\u201cFreund clearly delights in enigma. His vocals could go from laconic to impassioned without such obvious trickery as cranking up the volume. His lyrics are full of curveballs.\u201d \u2013Washington Post\n\nFreund\u2019s latest disc \u201cTwo Moons\u201d on Surf Road Records draws roots sources for an urbane Americana sound, melding nostalgia with a raw and sharp-eyed views of life today. \u201cIf Two Moons, with its underlying message of hope in this messy world of ours, serves as an inspiring, encouraging soundtrack for listeners, then I can say to myself, \u2018ok, you\u2019re doing something right for the people out there\u201d, Freund says. He delivers this CD\u2019s main message in the standout track \u201cLemme Be Who I Wanna Be,\u201d in which he declares: \u201cI\u2019m basically hooked on this life/it\u2019s got a lot of problems/but it treats me real right/and you don\u2019t have to agree with me/but let me fly my freak flag.\u201d This oddly upbeat anthem of personal empowerment so impressed Canadian rock star Serena Ryder that she asked to sing on it. The opening track \u201cAngel Eyes,\u201d featuring vocals by Ben Harper, serves as Freund\u2019s take on Randy Newman\u2019s \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d motif, expresses his appreciation to his Southern California friends for always having his back. Notes of nostalgia play into Tom\u2019s self-declared favorite track \u201cMind of Your Own\u201d which delves into a deeply personal memory of the New York native\u2019s childhood home.\n\n\u201cIf you want to hear what California feels like, Tom Freund\u2019s new album is a good place to start\u2026\u201d \u2013 Acoustic Guitar\n\nFreund spent the mid-\u201990s touring with the indie rock cult faves THE SILOS and has been releasing solo albums since 1998. Tom has alternated between recording and touring behind his own discs, playing upright bass, electric bass guitar, and mandolin with the likes of British pub-rock great Graham Parker (who hailed Freund as one of the best singer-songwriters operating today), pop star Mandy Moore, groove-soul sensation Brett Dennen, Rock \u2018n Roll Hall of Famer Jackson Browne, and three-time Grammy winner Ben Harper. \u201cWhat really brought me to wanting to work with Tom in the studio is his songs,\u201d Harper concludes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to even go any further than that. As far as I\u2019m concerned, who wouldn\u2019t wanna work with him in the studio? Because the songs are there.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery year the mounting landfill of new releases that threatens to bury the working music journalists yields a few unexpected gems, and Tom Freund is one of them.\u201d\n\u2013New York Times\n\nMore recently, you can spot Freund playing with Parker in the Judd Apatow film, \u201cThis Is 40\u201d and featured on the hit TV shows \u201cParenthood\u201d, \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d and the recently premiered Pamela Adlon show \u201cBetter Things\u201d. He continues to tour North America, Europe and Japan playing with his band or doing solo shows.\n\n\u201cCalifornia-based troubadour Tom Freund sings of skate-boarding kids, impending doom and Happy Days lunch boxes on his new album, Two Moons.\u201d \u2014NPR WEEKEND EDITION http://bit.ly/1N1vuBI", "otherInfo": "Tom Freund & Friends\nft.

Purchase & Stream at https://mavisstaples.ffm.to/wegetby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the messenger,\u201d Mavis Staples says on the eve of her 80th birthday. \u201cThat\u2019s my job\u2014it has been for my whole life\u2014and I can\u2019t just give up while the struggle\u2019s still alive. We\u2019ve got more work to do, so I\u2019m going to keep on getting stronger and keep on delivering my message every single day.\u201d\n\nThat message\u2014a clarion call to love, to faith, to justice, to brotherhood, to joy\u2014lies at the heart of \u2018We Get By,\u2019 Staples\u2019 spectacular twelfth studio album and first full-length collaboration with multi-GRAMMY Award-winner Ben Harper. Backed by her longtime touring band, Staples breathes extraordinary life into Harper\u2019s compositions on the record, delivering roof-raising performances with both a youthful vigor and a commanding maturity. The arrangements here are spare but weighty, matched by Harper\u2019s suitably lean and thoughtful production, and Staples seizes the opportunity to showcase her remarkable and continued evolution as an artist, one still growing and exploring more than half a century into her storied career. \u2018We Get By\u2019 is undoubtedly a timely collection, arriving such as it does in the face of deep social divisions and heightened political tensions, but like everything Staples touches, it\u2019s also larger than any particular moment, a timeless appeal to the better angels of our nature that\u2019s universal in its reach and unwavering in its assurance of better things to come.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started reading the lyrics Ben wrote for me, I said to myself, \u2018My God, he\u2019s saying everything that needs to be said right now,\u2019\u201d Staples remembers. \u201cBut the songs were also true to my journey and the stories I\u2019ve been singing all my life. There\u2019s a spirituality and an honesty to Ben\u2019s writing that took me back to church.\u201d\n\nHailed by NPR as \u201cone of America\u2019s defining voices of freedom and peace,\u201d Staples is the kind of once-in-a-generation artist whose impact on music and culture would be difficult to overstate. She\u2019s both a Blues and a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer; a civil rights icon; a GRAMMY Award-winner; a chart-topping soul/gospel/R&B pioneer; a National Arts Awards Lifetime Achievement recipient; and a Kennedy Center honoree. She marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., performed at John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration, and sang in Barack Obama\u2019s White House. She\u2019s collaborated with everyone from Prince and Bob Dylan to Arcade Fire and Hozier, blown away countless festivalgoers from Newport Folk and Glastonbury to Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, performed with The Band at The Last Waltz, and graced the airwaves on Fallon, Colbert, Ellen, Austin City Limits, Jools Holland, the GRAMMYs, and more. At a time when most artists begin to wind down, Staples ramped things up, releasing a trio of critically acclaimed albums in her 70\u2019s with Wilco\u2019s Jeff Tweedy that prompted Pitchfork to rave that \u201cher voice has only gained texture and power over the years\u201d and People to proclaim that she \u201cprovides the comfort of a higher power.\u201d In between records with Tweedy, Staples teamed up with a slew of other younger artists\u2014Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon, Nick Cave, Valerie June, tUnE-yArDs, and M. Ward among others\u2014for \u2018Livin\u2019 On A High Note,\u2019 an album The Boston Globe called \u201cstunningly fresh and cutting edge\u201d and which first introduced her to Harper.\n\n\u201cBen wrote a song for that album called \u201cLove and Trust,\u2019\u201d explains Staples. \u201cWhen he said he that he wanted to produce me, I told him, \u2018Well shucks, if you write another song like that, count me in.\u2019\u201d\n\nHarper did more than write just another song, instead penning an entire album of emotionally riveting and spiritually uplifting tracks that hit Staples directly in the heart. The tunes fit her like a glove\u2014due in no small part to the decades Harper spent listening to Staples\u2019s music, both with The Staple Singers and as a solo artist\u2014and Staples found herself fighting back tears as she fell in love with the beauty and sincerity of those early stripped down demos.\n\n\u201cI come from a family of Mavis fans,\u201d explains Harper, \u201cso her music has been woven into the fabric of my life from the very start. When I got the call for this gig, it felt like my entire career, everything I\u2019d ever written, had been pre-production for this.\u201d\n\nLeading up to the recording sessions, Harper sat in the audience for several of Staples\u2019 concerts, approaching her performances now as a student more than a fan. As brilliant as Staples\u2019 studio output was over the years, Harper came to understand the stage as her home and her touring band as her family, and capturing as much of that spirit as possible seemed like the obvious approach for \u2018We Get By.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much soul and Muscle Shoals in that band,\u201d explains Harper. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a specific chemistry that I recognized instantly. When you have a guitar player like Rick Holmstrom, a bass player like Jeff Turmes, a drummer like Stephen Hodges, and a vocalist like Donny Gerrard all supporting the voice of the century, why would you ever want to go outside of that foundation?\u201d\n\nWith Harper at the helm, the band recorded everything live at Henson Studio in Hollywood, CA, capturing the kind of powerhouse energy and deep pocket grooves that have come to define Staples\u2019 legendary concerts. While Harper had a distinct vision for the sound of the record, he purposely kept his demos to skeletal sketches, leaving space for Mavis and the band to interpret and give flight to his songs in the inimitable way that only they could.\n\n\u201cThe more I\u2019ve produced over the years, the more I\u2019ve heightened my sensitivity to what different artists require,\u201d reflects Harper. \u201cEvery artist and every album is different. With Mavis, sometimes the most important thing you can do is press record and just get the hell out of the way.\u201d\n\nThe record opens with the stirring \u201cChange,\u201d which finds Staples proclaiming, \u201cSay it loud say it clear / Gotta change around here\u201d over a simmering, fuzzed-out guitar line. It\u2019s a song focused as much internally as it is externally, and after one listen, it\u2019s plain to see why Staples and Harper referred to the studio\u2019s vocal booth as the \u201cprayer room.\u201d Staples\u2019 performance is hypnotic, holy even, restrained in its delivery but relentless in its urgency, and it lays the groundwork for an album that insists on joy and communal celebration without pulling any punches or sugarcoating any ugly truths. The funky \u201cAnytime\u201d looks fearlessly to the future, while the rousing \u201cBrothers and Sisters\u201d is a call for action in the face of injustice, and the gritty \u201cStronger\u201d promises there\u2019s no power in this world greater than our love for one another.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to listen to a voice like Staples\u2019 without contemplating all she\u2019s been through in her life\u2014the album cover features a heartrending Gordon Parks photo that speaks to the casual cruelty of racial segregation in 1950\u2019s Alabama\u2014but it only serves to make her optimism and resilience that much more inspiring and contagious. There is darkness and doubt on the album to be sure (the spirit of Pops Staples informs the mournful \u201cHeavy On My Mind,\u201d which recognizes that some wounds never heal, while the poignant \u201cNever Needed Anyone\u201d stings with the pain of lingering regret) but it\u2019s consistently overpowered by hope and conviction. \u201cBeen holding on too long to let go / Running too hard to slow down / Believing too deep to not have faith,\u201d Staples confesses on the soulful \u201cOne More Change To Make.\u201d In that sense, the album\u2019s title is more than just an observation. When Staples and Harper join forces to sing \u201cWe Get By,\u201d it\u2019s a prayer, a promise, an invitation.\n\n\u201cI sing because I want to leave people feeling better than I found them,\u201d Staples concludes. \u201cI want them to walk away with a positive message in their hearts, feeling stronger than they felt before. I\u2019m singing to myself for those same reasons, too.\u201d\n\nEven the messenger needs a reminder every now and then.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2174 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Jean-Michel Blais", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8688921.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.430418, 37.766622], "Date": "Fri Jan 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-31", "Genre": "Genres: Classic", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Swedish American Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "444 Battery St, San Francisco, CA 94111", "Artist": "Chris Porter (Comedy)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9729800.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399943, 37.795514], "Date": "Fri Jan 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-31", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Punch Line Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "427 Mendocino Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95401", "Artist": "Clementine Darling", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9268259.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.715214, 38.441851], "Date": "Fri Jan 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-31", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Indie, Acoustic, Alt-Country, Americana, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Lost Church", "moreBioInfo": "lementine Darling is a folk singer-songwriter making waves in San Francisco\u2019s music scene.

Bring four fiercely individual players together, and a shared musical vocabulary emerges. This is exactly the dynamic of Walking Distance, the New York collective of Caleb Curtis (alto saxophone), Kenny Pexton (tenor saxophone), Adam Cot\u00e9 (double bass) and Shawn Baltazor (drums). Neighborhood is the band\u2019s debut release; a visceral and sincere celebration of finding home and a sense of belonging wherever you are. Two saxophonists intertwine in sound and concept, often blending seamlessly and engaging in a spirited interplay with the drums and bass. The band revels in a wide range of possibilities; from melodic swing and grooving rock, to free bop and soulful ballads, with a dash of terror-inducing chaos. The album features entirely original compositions with the exception of one American Songbook standard \u2013 a radically re-imagined \u201cI Could Have Danced All Night\u201d from My Fair Lady. Neighborhood was self produced by the band, recorded by Shawn Baltazor, and mixed by the Grammy Nominated Ben Rubin at the House of Cha Cha in New York. It\u2019s a wild ride through territory that jazz masters can call home, while remaining evocative and inspiring to the new listener.

Em maio de 2009, em Curitiba, o PHANTOM foi criado oficialmente com a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de seguir o legado do aut\u00eantico Heavy Metal, n\u00e3o somente reproduzindo seus cl\u00e1ssicos nos shows, mas, principalmente, criando novas m\u00fasicas. A maior parte dos m\u00fasicos nasceu na d\u00e9cada de 80 \u2013 em plena efervesc\u00eancia do Heavy Metal -, e t\u00eam como principal influ\u00eancia os grandes nomes da cena banger mundial, tais como: o guitarrista Dave Mustaine do Megadeth, que inspira o m\u00fasico Leandro Ramos na hora de compor os seus riffs mel\u00f3dicos, ou os vocalistas James Hetfield (Metallica) e Ozzy Osbourne (Black Sabbath), exemplos a serem seguidos por Rafael Valente, que usa e abusa de seus drives. O baixista Rafael Calmezini come\u00e7ou sua carreira no Metal ouvindo o bolach\u00e3o do debut \u00e1lbum do Metallica, e repetindo os acordes do Cliff Burton como autodidata. J\u00e1 Gregory Raphael come\u00e7ou a tocar bateria por influ\u00eancia familiar, levado pelos ritmos oriundos do Grunge e do Funk. Depois se aperfei\u00e7oou ao Metal, escutando bandas como Pantera, Gojira e Korn. Foi em junho de 2012 que a banda lan\u00e7ou seu primeiro EP, intitulado \u201cWhere There\u2019s Smoke, There\u2019s Fire\u201d, seguindo de alguns shows na capital e regi\u00e3o em seu suporte, resultando em boa repercuss\u00e3o diante da m\u00eddia e p\u00fablico local. 2013 foi um ano de mudan\u00e7as. Com uma nova forma\u00e7\u00e3o, o grupo passou a ter apenas uma guitarra, conduzida por Leandro Ramos, e Rafael Valente assumindo os vocais. O PHANTOM seguiu fazendo shows com o EP \u201cWhere There\u2019s Smoke, There\u2019s Fire\u201d e, em paralelo, trabalhando nas composi\u00e7\u00f5es visando o lan\u00e7amento do seu primeiro \u00e1lbum. Em 2014, houve mais uma mudan\u00e7a significativa na forma\u00e7\u00e3o da banda, desta feita no posto de baterista, com Gregory Raphael assumindo as baquetas, logo ap\u00f3s o lan\u00e7amento digital do seu primeiro \u00e1lbum, providencialmente batizado de \u201cPsycho Minds\u201d. Agora a banda se dedica na divulga\u00e7\u00e3o do referido trabalho, atrav\u00e9s de shows pelo Brasil, antes do lan\u00e7amento f\u00edsico do seu disco atrav\u00e9s da MS Metal Records, no m\u00eas de novembro de 2014.

Affectionately known as the \u201cIron Man of the Mask,\u201d Franc held the title of \u201cThe World\u2019s Longest-Running Phantom\u201d for more than a decade after bringing over five million theatre-goers to their feet in a 6-1/2-year run.\n\nBut that distinction only scratches the surface of an illustrious career spanning decades, including his portrayal of the opera-singing Anthony Corleone, son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton\u2019s characters in the seven-time Academy Award-nominated film Godfather III. Franc also sang the Academy Award-winning theme song \"Speak Softly Love\" for both the film and Original Motion Picture soundtrack, garnering over one million hits on YouTube. Paramount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search for the young Corleone, auditioning more than 2,000 artists over a one-year period before casting Franc in the role. He is the first and only person ever to sing Carmine Coppola\u2019s haunting Godfather theme in the film trilogy.\n\nFranc\u2019s performance of the song so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to study at Pavarotti\u2019s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously studied at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of \u201cTony\u201d in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow\u2019s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical.\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s BROADWAY: Songs from the Great White Way, and Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, along with tributes to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, including NBC\u2019s \u201cBrian Boitano\u2019s Skating Spectacular\u201d and \u201cThe 2005 Tribute to Music on Ice\u201d with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc\u2019s performance of \u201cMusic of the Night,\u201d as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening\u2019s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nIn May 2018, Franc was honored to receive a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival. He has released three successful solo CDs, one of which has the unique distinction as the soundtrack for Barry Manilow\u2019s daily workout.

The San Diego-native has earned a dusty mystique over the past few years as the center of the Desert Hearts movement and as a house and techno provocateur with a stage presence that suggests he will ride this wave all the way to the top. If there's one thing Mikey does well, it's get the party started.\n\nLion has brought the mothafuckin' ruckus to the stages of Lightning in a Bottle, the dustiest storms at Burning Man, and The Do LaB at Coachella, earning nods from Claude VonStroke, Jamie Jones, and Green Velvet in the process. In doing so, Lion and his signature top hat have developed a boisterous voice in the House & Techno scene with strong tribal, hip-hop, and psychedelic elements.\n\nBut it all started with Wu-Tang and Daft Punk. Lion first found his way behind the decks as a thirteen year old kid, scratching underground hip-hop records religiously after school. At Coachella as a seventeen year old, he witnessed that legendary Daft Punk performance on the same night he tasted his first dose of psychedelics. The show had such a monumental impact on him, he gave up Hip-Hop and became a House DJ the very next day.\n\nAfter honing his craft with weekly marathon DJ sessions at Sala Razzmatazz in Barcelona, Mikey was introduced to Burner culture at Lightning in a Bottle, 2011. It was at his first Burning Man in 2011 that he found a community calling and merged forces with his brother Porkchop, life long friends Marbs & Deep Jesus, and the inimitable Lee Reynolds to form The Desert Hearts Crew.\n\nIn November 2012, Desert Hearts began as a seedy, 200-person renegade gathering deep in the Mojave Desert. The intrepid crew barely survived a set of extreme weather conditions and unfortunate circumstances, but that first party sparked a fire. The entire point of that first Desert Hearts was to create as much love as humanly possible, and now that same gathering has evolved into the darling of the West Coast house and techno scene. The Bi-annual festival is capped at 3500 attendees in order to create the best possible vibe. Built upon beautiful people getting as weird as possible to deep and trippy house and techno, Desert Hearts has already achieved iconic status in the North American Festival Scene.\n\nDesert Hearts has given rise to a family of thousands and it's safe to call it a bonafide movement of love. And while Desert Hearts Records launched in 2014 as a totally-free record label, pushes the sonic aesthetic of the scene, the crew\u2019s busy international calendar of bookings has the DH message spreading far and wide.

Music balanced out the highly structured lifestyle of his military family, as his mother and siblings sang and played drums and piano, and his father was a writer, producer and the minister of music at church. He wrote and produced his first song at 12 years old,recording it in his basement on a 4 track tape recorder. A brief period of discouragement was tackled when Xavier Om\u00e4r decided to audition for American Idol Season 11 in Houston, TX.

GTA sets are musical joyrides with the guys at the wheel, as they speed from trap and hip-hop into booming electro, take unexpected detours with rock and R&B, and screech to a halt for\nmassive bass drops. Despite GTA\u2019s wild, unpredictable sets, everything the duo does \u2013 both on stage and in the studio \u2013 is unified by a simple mission statement: death to genres.\n\n\u201cA lot of people argue about the kind of music they listen to, what\u2019s cool and what\u2019s not,\u201d Mejia explains. \u201cBut for us, it\u2019s just about good music.\u201d\n\nThe duo\u2019s open-mindedness is closely tied to their Miami roots, as they were exposed urban, electronic rock and Latin sounds in equal measure. \u201cOur friends were into everything,\u201d Toth says. \u201cThat\u2019s how we grew up.\u201d They also got early starts in making their own music; Mejia played trumpet in middle school \u2013 he was part of a salsa band for a time \u2013 and later learned drums and guitar, and Toth taught himself to play guitar before attending audio engineering school.\n\nSlowly but surely, though, the guys found their way into Miami\u2019s dance scene. Toth attended Ultra Music Festival for the first time in 2008 and Mejia scored a job working in the festival\u2019s Carl Cox tent the following year. They also began to experiment with production and DJing. Matt had started as a solo act, Van Toth, catering to the Miami scene with Latinflavored tech house. Meanwhile, under the moniker JWLS, Mejia gained online notoriety with his trap and moombahton bootlegs. A mutual Facebook friend thought the two would hit it off, and made a virtual introduction in February 2010.\n\nThe guys had exchanged some messages and music online when Toth called Mejia for a spur-of-the-moment hangout. They connected instantly thanks to an unlikely shared interest: When Toth picked him up, Mejia remembers, \u201che turned on a System of a Down CD. He knew every song, I knew every song. That was how we became friends.\u201d\n\nThe next day, they became production partners, too. \u201cWe tried working together,\u201d Mejia says of their first studio session, \u201cand it just worked.\u201d They finished their first collaboration in a single sitting, and sent it off to a few labels for feedback. Much to their surprise, Toth and Mejia heard directly from Afrojack who wanted to sign the song to his Wall Recordings imprint. \u201cWe got the email and we freaked out,\u201d Mejia says. \u201cIt was literally a month after we met. That\u2019s how GTA got started. And ever since then it\u2019s just been constant.\u201d\n\n\u201cConstant\u201d is putting it lightly. In their three years as GTA, Mejia and Toth have kept the releases flowing while also touring nearly nonstop. They\u2019ve released cult-favorite tracks on some of the dance world\u2019s biggest labels \u2013 Diplo\u2019s Mad Decent, A-Trak\u2019s Fool\u2019s Gold Records, Tiesto\u2019s Musical Freedom and Calvin Harris\u2019 Fly Eye, for starters \u2013 and have done remixes for artists ranging from Kylie Minogue to deadmau5. Meanwhile, the guys have hit the road with Rihanna, opening for her 2013 Diamonds World Tour and ended the year with a bang as part of Calvin Harris and Tiesto\u2019s Greater Than Tour.\n\nAs they\u2019ve promoted their genre-free ethos, Toth and Mejia have become bona fide tastemakers to fans and fellow artists alike, proving that \u201cdance music\u201d is best defined as whatever makes you move. GTA\u2019s all-inclusive style is best exemplified in their \u201cDeath To Genres\u201d mixes, which resist classification and instead go for maximum energy.\n\nNow, the guys are prepping a barrage of new releases as part of a freshly-inked deal with Three Six Zero Music and Warner Bros Records. In true \u201cdeath to genres\u201d style, Toth says of the releases, \u201cwe have a little bit of everything, and we definitely won\u2019t hold anything back.\u201d\n\nGTA\u2019s first single under the deal \u2013 the Juyen Sebulba collaboration \u201cHard House\u201d \u2013 is an ideal taste of what\u2019s to come. It is one of the duo\u2019s most defiantly anti-genre tracks to date, and purposefully so. Mejia says, \u201cWe knew the first thing had to be in your face.\u201d\n\nWhether you prefer to say the powerhouse duo is killing genres or creating their own, one thing is clear: GTA is on a bold musical mission, and they\u2019re taking us along for the ride.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2369 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "ICandy", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.434352, 37.762839], "Date": "Fri Jan 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-31", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "I Candy at The Cafe: This long-running gay dance hotspot recently reopened after major renovations.

The Prohibition Mob Band released its third CD, \"My Heart Belongs To Satchmo\" on Blujazz in 2018. This record is devoted to the early music of Louis Armstrong, continuing the band's tradition of resurrecting both well-known and obscure vintage music. Previously, the group released \"A Little Sugar\" (2012) and \"Bathtub Gin\" (2015) on Motema. \"A Little Sugar\" spent 9 weeks on the Jazz radio charts, and \"Bathtub Gin\" was named one of the Best Albums of 2015 by DownBeat Magazine.\n\nAward-winning singer and composer Roberta Donnay has been performing and recording for more than two decades.

Roberta Donnay, the driving wheel behind Roberta Donnay and the Prohibition Mob Band, fits that description. - Music and More Arizona\n\nMusicians can take on the role of anthropologist, curious about what came before in music and how musicians reflected their world around them. Award-winning vocalist and songwriter Roberta Donnay is that rare species of musician who almost lives in another time, as she and her Prohibition Mob Band exist to revive the Jazz Age of America. -Motema\n\nDOWNBEAT MAGAZINE 4 stars **** Stylistic kind to flappers of the anything goes 1920s, Roberta Donnay has a silky, clean voice that is a small marvel of geniality, rarely dipping into touchy-feely cuteness.

All the while, the well-groomed, jazz-inclined Prohibition Mob Band motors along spiritedly.\n-DownBeat\n\nDonnay takes old school jazz, makes it new cool and most of all makes it fun.

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe. On the production and remix side of the musical pendulum, Jask has appeared on such notable labels as: Vega, King Street/NiteGrooves, I!Records, Swanky, Metaphor, K2/Vinylicious, Step Ahead, Erotic City, DeepTouch, Harlequin, SoulGroove, Soulfuric Deep, Soulfuric, Soufuric Trax, Catch 22, Deeplay, Solu, Om, Vino, Defected, Undo, Large Music, Salted, Sole Channel, Ultra, Rhythm & Culture, Transport & NeoDisco.

This was Jask's first original vocal track in which he wrote everything from the music to the lyrics with haunting lush deep vocals from his friend Jocie. It is a special release in which Jask has dedicated it to his late mother who passed away July 31, 2001. Due to the successful Jacks house night in Tampa and his music productions, Jask has had the luxury of performing/djing across the United States and beyond.

Both of these disparate strands filtered through a lifetime on the run and on the search for a universal truth from psychedelic Brazilian forests to US college campuses and further into his own unique vision. JL Stiles has a mind that sees music in a similar way to how J.S. Bach saw music, however, Bach never played the blues.\n\nFact # 1: JL Stiles is the John Nash of music.\n\nJL Stiles was born with hardwiring most only dream about, a brain that could look at the most basic picture and convert it to it's numerical basics. All through school in rural Connecticut it was clear where he was going to be, working at the cutting edge of mathematics, as he took to the abstract shapes and numbers as a duck would take to proverbial water, until, that is, a band wearing grease paint, Cuban heels, questionable body hair and several pints of fake blood rolled into JL's particular little town: Kiss. A 12 year old JL was hooked by the devils fishing rod that was rock and/or roll and when his brother brought home a terrible guitar from college and left it when he went back, JL had the tools to begin his assault on the world.\n\nHe began fashioning songs using the simple chunking and melody of Jimmy Reed and sub-Rush lyrics about the challenging political world as seen by a 13-year old kid. Quick introductions to the lyrics of Bob Dylan, the power and message of The Who and the space-age ass funk of Parliament, shaped his musical balloon in new ways and JL, taking his John Nash brain and applying it to the one piece of equipment he had at his disposal, a useless dime store guitar, realized pretty quickly that he better maximize the algorithmic potential of the pathetic instrument by learning to pick each and every string independently and simultaneously with the dexterity of a perfect machine and the re-incarnated soul of a genius blind bluesman who strangely disappeared in the early 1930's. That blind genius would be the little known 20's & 30's virtuoso, Blind Blake, who JL heard by accident, floating in from the radio of his father while studying late one night on a mathematical problem involving fourier transformations. He rushed to the transistor just quickly enough to catch the name and his future was born. (He also finished the problem that night in case you wondered).\n\nFact #2: JL Stiles is the freakiest white fingerpicking guitarist in this great country right now.\n\nStiles carried on in his twin disciplines, learning Banach spaces and homology at college by day and wearing out his Blind Blake records at night, studying under the tutelage of the great Laszlo Fuchs, pioneer of abelian group theory, whilst writing hundreds of songs, each one getting gradually better than the last. Both strands were equal to him as he searched for the big picture in whatever way he could.\n\nBut something began to happen; as the songs got better and began to get attention, especially from the ladies, and JL realized that, Fuchs aside, a lot of academicians can be big dicks with fragile egos, he began to drift toward the more standard methods of soul searching for a young guy in late 20th century America: LSD, pot and anything other.\n\nHanging out in the blazing heat studying with Chinese Mathematicians, drifting into oblivion on opium and psychedelics, JL knew the music was more than a sideshow to a brilliant career in the outer reaches of theoretical math. It was, in fact, his calling, and one where he could teach the beauty of what is so perfect about math and blues, the abstract.\n\nImagine a wild-eyed, half-crazed math prodigy with the most dexterous fingers on earth, channeling the spirit of a mysterious blind blues genius who unexplainably vanished, and you are approaching where JL found himself at this juncture in his life.\n\nFact #3: The search for the fundamentals is the same in music as it is in math: The fingerpicking guitar opens up infinite possibilities\n\nBut what would he do with this burden? He wasn't just a singer-songwriter with a cute heartbreak song and a big white smile; he was the walking soul of mathematical fundamental principles driven into the ground by the spirit of the blues. Where could a young boy like this go? To the home of voodoo, New Orleans.\n\nIn an out of the coffee houses and clubs of New Orleans and Mississippi, JL spooked the audiences up and down and left and right, he cut a solo set of songs, just him and a guitar, that rang as clear and true as Blind Blake had 80 years earlier and he knew he had to get out there and spread the theory around.\n\nHe traveled to Mexico and Brazil, Amsterdam and Scandinavia, he lived in the woods for weeks at a time, writing new songs and trying to define a unifying mathematical and musical theory in homological algebra, he went to the brink and stared at the abyss and then he came back with songs in hand to deliver the message back to us dear souls who hadn't made the journey.\n\nHe found a spiritual home in san Francisco and immediately picked up on the musical community there. He played with Etta James in front of 6,000 in front of the courthouse in Riverside, he opened for the great Keb Mo, Leon Redbone, JJ Cale, John Hammond, he knew he was in the right place at the right time, and so, here he is.\n\nFact #4: What JL Stiles is writing now is the best he's ever written and is closer to the fundamental truth of bringing the past together with the future into a musical singularity than he's ever gotten.\n\nFact #5: JL Stiles believes he has come up with the algorithm for the pure heart of music.\n\nJL Stiles is a unique animal (as we have stated before), he believes that the soul of 1920's blues, c.400 BC Greek mathematicians and 21st century artists like Animal Collective (get ready for JL's incendiary cover of AC's \"No More Runnin\") can all be unified into his singular vision. Can he do it? With his head for numbers, I certainly wouldn't bet against him.", "otherInfo": "Stiles solo con guitar and harmonica"}, {"Address": "6490 Washington St, Yountville, CA 94599", "Artist": "Dennis Johnson - Slide Guitarist", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8270194.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.359113, 38.400484], "Date": "Sat Feb 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-01", "Genre": "Genres: Roots Rock, Americana, Blues, New Orleans, Rock", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "Priest Ranch Wines", "moreBioInfo": "Dennis Johnson is one of the elite slide guitar players performing today.

Their introduction to folk music came later, when a close friend--who died young due to a tragic misdiagnosis--entrusted to them her collection of 1960s folk albums and her guitar (which has since been featured on all of their albums). Inspired by the grit and true-to-life experiences she heard in these traditional ballads, Hall was inspired to write the lyrics that later became her first songs, aided by Anderson\u2019s flair for musical arrangement. Soon afterwards, Hall released two solo albums, Sings! (1999) and Sunday Afternoon (2002), both produced by Anderson. In the winter of 2003, the duo quit their boring desk jobs, moved to the green hills of Vermont, and decided to pursue a full-time career as touring musicians.\n\n\n\nThey released their first CD, Hungrytown, in 2008; Any Forgotten Thing in 2011; and Further West in 2015.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Influenced by those early surroundings, songwriters Jamie and Kellen Coffis\u2019 blend of folk, blues, R&B and straight-ahead rock is evidence an upbringing spent listening to all of the right records from Tom Petty, Neil Young, and The Beatles.\n\nOn their third full-length album, Roll With It, The Coffis Brothers put that rock into overdrive, looking ahead to the good things coming and suffering no fools. First single \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Got the Heart\u201d is a barn burner and a fan favorite, having already been part of the band\u2019s live set for a couple of years. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of that sense of angst and that sort of \u2018I don\u2019t need this\u2019 attitude,\u201d says Kellen Coffis, \u201cbut don\u2019t overthink this one.\u201d\n\nNot that there isn\u2019t plenty to think about on Roll With It. Tracks like \u201cBad Luck\u201d and \u201cBetter Days\u201d reflect on how to live with and learn from rough times, while \u201cYou and Me\u201d is a testament to how people can make it through these things together. But on every song, The Coffis Brothers & the Mountain Men stay true to a rock sound that draws from Southern grit and California hills.\n\nRoll With It was recorded on analog tape over a week at Barefoot Studios in Hollywood with producer Andy Zenczak and engineer Cian Riordan. The band\u2019s near-constant touring throughout California and elsewhere has earned them not only devoted fans, but lots of critical praise as well:\n\n\u201cThe Coffis Brothers & the Mountain Men have developed a sound that has an easy rock vibe that\u2019s actually hip.\u201d \u2013 San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\u201cThe Coffis Brothers mix a blend of folk, country and rock with the intensity of personal lyrics into a gritty and often tender harmony of sound\u2026 a show that delivers one part Avett Brothers and one part early Neil Young for a full night of dancing and fun.\u201d \u2013 Santa Cruz Weekly\n\nJamie and Kellen are joined by Kyle Poppen on lead guitar, Aidan Collins on bass and Sam Kellerman on drums.

She emerged three days later with an independently recorded and produced cassette tape titled \"Cloudy Day On Mountain Lodge\". She handed it out to her grade school classmates, and had wired up third graders singing her songs on the playground. Born and raised in Woodstock, NY by a hippie mom who brought her kids up on brown rice and The Rolling Stones and a Jamaican born father whose mother traveled on the blues circuit playing piano in the south, it\u2019s no surprise that Simi Stone ne: Simantha Molly Lou Sernaker has since turned into a formidable power house fueled by a raw and edgy vocal style, virtuoso violin chops and enough charisma to burn down a house.\nAt seven, Simi took up the classical violin, and at ten was admitted to the New York Conservatory for the Arts, where she studied musical theatre, dance, and voice and all the while continued to write the songs of her own. Upon graduating high school, she moved to New York City, and pursued a degree in acting at Marymount College, performed in musical theater and off Broadway plays. Soon, Simi was using her well-honed theater skills to front a rock band. Along with her fierce electric violin and guitar playing, Simi was a draw for teenyboppers and seasoned musicians alike. She played on Conan and was featured in Cornershop and Metallica videos. She appeared on the cover of the Cornershop CD, Born for the Seventh Time. A piece about her appeared in Women\u2019s Wear Daily and Greg Tate in The Village Voice called her \u201cKurt Cobain in hot pants.\u201d Ink 19 Magazine said, \u201cWhen shredding the bow on her electric violin, she just plain looked badass.\u201d\nLater, after being part of the Afro-Punk Movement, she experimented with a more gritty rock \u2018n roll sound, forming Suffrajett with sideman Jason Chasko. They performed in numerous NYC venues including Bowery Ballroom, Irving Plaza and played several Summer Stage events with Joan Jett, the Roots, Erika Badu and others. With Suffrajett she released two records, Suffrajett and Black Glitter on indie labels In Music We Trust and Giant Step Records which garnered considerable critical acclaim from magazines such as Rolling Stone, Esquire and earned five stars in the press, The Chicago Sun Times. Suffrajett had their first major tour out of Chicago. She earned her stripes the old fashioned way, with numerous cross-country tours playing every club under the sun from Detroit to House of Blues in LA. Leading her band, she continued touring with acts like Local-H, Urge Overkill, Cheap Trick, Eagles of Death Metal, and Juliette and the Licks. Time Out Chicago said of Suffrajett: \u201c This New York via Chicago band has justifiably gained a rep for Detroit style whiplash rock and roll without acting like it\u2019s a low down dirty shame\u2026When she\u2019s not sounding like The Shangri Las Mary Weiss, she\u2019s summoning the ghost of T-Rex\u2019s Marc Bolan, who knew how to make a whisper sound like a threat.\u201d Around this time, the heavy mid-west rock n\u2019 roll lifestyle started to weigh on Simi. Suffrajett took a long hiatus ...\nCalled to the mountains of her native Woodstock home, in 2009 Simi reconnected with Simone Felice and Bobby Burke, The Duke and the King, while opening for their band as a solo artist. With the Duke and the King, Simi began touring in Europe and all over the UK. The band was featured on Jools Holland in London, Saturday with Brendan O\u2019Conner the biggest late night talk show in Ireland and in Paris appeared on the popular show Canal Plus. She sang her song \u201cNo Easy Way Out\u201d on Belfast\u2019s biggest radio station and on BBC Radio\u2019s \u201cLoose End\u201d in London. Mojo Magazine gave the Duke and the King four stars. Allen Jones from Un-cut magazine called her \"The sensational Simi Stone\" and calls her voice \"striking\" and her violin, \"a thing of mournful beauty.\nSimi Has,more recently , been excitedly working on her first Solo record! With musical partner David Baron she has been lucky enough to gather an amazing band of players...including Zachary Alford, Sara Lee, Gail Ann Dorsey and others to make up some incredible recordings and live shows to come.\nSimi also has spent time recording and performing with artists such as Simone Felice,Natalie Merchant, Conor O'Berst, Tracy Bonham, Amy Helm, and many more.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4045 Piedmont Ave, Oakland, CA 94611", "Artist": "Adrian West Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8534863.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.25306, 37.826171], "Date": "Sat Feb 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-01", "Genre": "Genres: Worldly Rock, Acoustic, Rock, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Caffe Chiave", "moreBioInfo": "Ask him what kind of music The Adrian West Band plays and Adrian will answer \"Yes.\" Or if he's feeling cocky, he'll answer \"Good.\"\n\nThe long answer: the band plays original acoustic rock songs that have drawn comparison to Paul Simon, Talkingheads & Dave Matthews.\n\nAdrian is an exciting performer to watch. With an uplifting, almost child-like singing voice, he moves seamlessly between guitar & violin, sometimes making tasteful use of live looping to enhance the listening experience. He's not afraid to tackle difficult topics in his songwriting; Safe Streets is about police violence, Close Your Eyes is about the beauty bias in the mass media, and Random Serenade is about the meaninglessness of life.

He later learned to play drums, guitar and developed his vocal and songwriting technique.\n\nHe moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1995 where as a sideman violinist he began supporting local Bay Area bands, playing some of the area's better known venues including the Fillmore, Yoshi's SF (main stage), Slim\u2019s, The Independent and The Sweetwater.\n\nWhen Adrian began performing solo, he combined violin, guitar, mandolin, beatboxing and vocals into a live performance that relied heavily on 'looping'. He recorded an all-instrumental demo CD called The One-Man String Quartet which got airplay on Keller Williams' nationally syndicated radio show Keller's Cellar, as well as on Derk Richardson's Hear and Now show on KPFA in Berkeley.\n\nIn 2005 he formed the Adrian West Trio and in 2010 he released his first full-length CD Chameleons and Butterflies.\n\nSince then the band has performed at small venues and festivals all over the Bay Area.\n\nRecently Adrian combined his love of music with his love of science in a multimedia show called An Evening of Music & Science which weaves his music with synchronized videos and presentations on the subject of how life began on Earth.

The answer, my friend, is somewhere \u201cIn the Morse Code of Brake Lights,\u201d as The New Pornographers would have it on their eighth album. There\u2019s a deep climatic unease running through these 11 tracks that\u2019s matched only by the sheer musical glee with which the band addresses the prevailing mood of the moment. It\u2019s an album in which foreboding and bliss somehow go hand in hand\u2014mixing founder A.C. Newman\u2019s nearly symphonic levels of pop arrangement and harmony with a careening quality that feels unsafe at any speed (to quote the famous Ralph Nader phrase that the opening track also borrows).\n\n\u201cSometimes unintentional influences come in, and then after you start to notice them, you start consciously doing it,\u201d says Newman. \u201cI was about two-thirds of the way through the record when I began to notice that lyrically so much of it was pointing toward car songs. The opening track is \u2018You'll Need a Backseat Driver,\u2019 and that was a metaphor that seemed to be running through other songs, too. Next to the love song, I feel like the car song is one of the most iconic kinds of songs in pop music, from Chuck Berry to the present. There was so much of that throughout it that I started thinking: \u2018Oh, no, there\u2019s too many references to cars on this record!\u2019 And then I thought, no, that's good\u2014people might think it\u2019s a concept album,\u201d he laughs. \u201cLet\u2019s roll with that.\u201d\n\nBut Newman\u2019s automotive concerns are very different from Chuck Berry\u2019s, or Bruce Springsteen\u2019s. \u201cOf course, because I\u2019m a person with some degree of empathy and it\u2019s 2019, there couldn\u2019t help but be this sort of anger and panic at the state of the world that runs through everything,\u201d Newman says. \u201cAnd I think that lends itself to the car metaphor. We\u2019re in this vehicle and it doesn\u2019t stop moving and we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\u201d In a time of heightened shared anxiety, maybe it\u2019s better not to know. \u201cI think it was Robert Louis Stevenson who said, \u2018Better to travel hopefully than to arrive\u2019\u2014which I basically paraphrase in the first chorus of the first song.\u201d\n\nThe New Pornographers have been road-worthy since their founding in 2000. But there\u2019s no mistaking that, with In the Morse Code of Brake Lights (their second release for Concord, following 2017\u2019s Whiteout Conditions), what has long been referred to as a \u201csupergroup\u201d has actually coalesced into something like, you know, an actual group\u2014one with a regular, solidified lineup, the presence of someone as independently famous as Neko Case as co-lead vocalist notwithstanding.\n\nNewman is doing all the songwriting now, save for a few lines contributed by former (and possibly future) member Dan Bejar. Drummer Joe Seiders is into his second album with the group, and you\u2019ll notice his presence on the kit especially in the opening couple of tracks. \u201cIf there was any song that had the biggest influence on us in terms of its drumming, it's \u2018Dreaming\u2019 by Blondie,\u201d Newman says. \u201cI always loved that that song is essentially a drum solo, and at times we do that.\u201d His niece is a greater instrumental presence this time: \u201cIn terms of keyboards, this record has such a Kathryn Calder stamp. There was a point where she started playing this part on \u2018Solomon\u2019 and I feel like it just changed the record. When I heard what she did with it, I said, \u2018Do this on every song.\u2019\u201d Longtime touring member Simi Stone is participating on record for the first time, as well.\n\nAt the same time, Newman is also sharpening his auteur chops a little by taking over as sole producer. Bassist John Collins, his usual co-producer, \u201cwas having a kid, and that coincided with me becoming a lot more savvy in the studio,\u201d Newman says. \u201cJohn was always the guy who was doing a lot of the audio manipulation and messing with arpeggiators and echoes, and I was always the guy standing behind him going, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s cool. Let's do more of that.\u2019 On this record it ended up that I was the guy doing it and the guy going, \u2018That\u2019s cool. Let\u2019s make sure we don't lose it.\u2019 So that to me was the big difference. And it was very fun. Although I had to be careful not to spend too much time with myself, because you can just descend into madness.\u201d\n\nThe New Pornographers still remain one of the few bands of any significance to employ multiple lead vocalists\u2014a province usually left to obscure and un-influential little bands like the Beatles, so you can see why it never caught on much. \u201cIf you listen to this record, it has slightly more Neko than usual,\u201d Newman points out. \u201cBut I didn't really think of the balance as much this time around. Especially when Dan was singing on the records, how much to use each singer was always on my mind, in the sequencing and in general. And on this record, I didn\u2019t really care at all. I thought, if it\u2019s almost all me, then so be it, or if it\u2019s more Neko, then so be it\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s just the way the music industry has changed\u2014in that it's going off in directions that we don\u2019t even understand\u2014that when I\u2019m making a record, I think, why even guess what the right thing to do is? Just do it, whatever makes sense to you.\u201d\n\nThese questions do come up, even as the lineup finally stabilizes. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the idea of the Pornographers kind of morphing as we go along,\u201d Newman says. \u201cWhen we put out the first record, I didn't think of the reality of what are we going to do if this thing becomes popular? I used to joke around that I wanted it to be a computer program that you could feed songs through and they would come out the other side as The New Pornographers, and it didn\u2019t necessarily matter who was in the band. But then a weird thing happened where people in the band became semi-famous. And then my dream of being the Alan Parsons Project, with everyone being faceless, went up in smoke. There\u2019s too many people with personalities in this band,\u201d he jokes, knowing that, even as an \u201cI Robot\u201d fan, that\u2019s not such a bad problem to have.\n\nWhen Whiteout Conditions came out two years ago, Newman openly acknowledged the Jeff Lynne influence, along with the simultaneous addition of a kraut-rock pulse. This time it was less about Lynne\u2019s influence on the synth stacking than on actual strings, with the quartet Strength of Materials playing parts written and arranged by Newman\u2019s fellow Canadian Ford Pier. \u201cThere are about four songs on the record that are fairly string heavy, and I didn\u2019t want them to sound like your average strings,\u201d says Newman. \u201cIf they were going to sound like anything, I wanted them to sound like ELO, because I will always love ELO. It\u2019s an influence I will never be embarrassed about. We use a string quartet that was doubled\u2014which I think is the early ELO method, before he could afford entire orchestras.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the entire record feels ornate, by any stretch of the hard-driving indie-pop-rock-and-roll imagination. Even as Newman was considering how to add strings onto some of the songs, he was thinking about how to strip others further back.\n\n\u201cThe influences that made us do Whiteout Conditions felt like a natural progression, and those are still with us,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was also wanting to do songs that felt more like a throwback to older songs we used to play. The second song on the record, \u2018The Surprise Knock,\u2019 had a different feel when we first recorded it\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t mind releasing that version at some point. But as I was listening to it, I thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we play this song like New Pornographers 2005?\u2019 Then we just replayed it with that feel. I thought enough time has passed that I feel like I can play songs that sort of sound like a classic Pornographers sound and not feel like I\u2019m repeating myself, because it\u2019s been so long. That was definitely a part of it: just wanting to\u2026I hate to say \u2018get back,\u2019 but just get more slightly raucous and sounding more like a band.\u201d\n\nThe track \u201cYou Won\u2019t Need Those Where You\u2019re Going\u201d definitely doesn\u2019t sound like a band, because it\u2019s just Newman and a piano, an approach he modeled with the simplicity of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cShelter from the Storm\u201d in mind. But that, too, felt reminiscent of a previous period in the Pornographers\u2019 oeuvre. \u201cThat felt like a throwback to something like Twin Cinema, which I think was the first record where we really branched out and just decided that we can do whatever we want, and we get to decide what a Pornographers song is or what it sounds like.\u201d\n\nLyrically, no one will accuse In the Morse Code of Brake Lights of simplicity, with its fantastic rushes of wordplay. He\u2019s the first to admit that this isn\u2019t just a \u201ccars\u201d album, but that there are mixed metaphors everywhere. It\u2019s the way he works, as he tries to cloak the blatant social and political statements he might make in interviews or on Twitter in a language that is both wittier and ultimately more mystical.\n\n\u201cThere is so much politics that runs through all the lyrics, and it\u2019s inescapable,\u201d he says. \u201cI try not to constantly go on about it, but it\u2019s a very scary time. I try not to be too explicit, and I\u2019m going to try to make it a little more wrapped up in metaphor and playing with the sound of words. Sometimes I do wonder to myself, is this completely inscrutable, or just completely too straightforward? In a song like \u2018Colossus of Rhodes,\u2019 the lyrics are very much about this time. I began to think of the Colossus of Rhodes as this metaphor for America, like the eighth wonder of the world, and nobody knows quite what happened to it, but it fell. The fear is that we\u2019re kind of at the end of the American Empire. I read the news and try and piece everything together, and more and more I can\u2019t see a way out of this, there's nothing to go back to. We can\u2019t go back to 2008 or 2009 and everybody\u2019s excited because Obama won, because those eight years caused something to become very rabid. But I don\u2019t want to write the \u2018I hate Trump\u2019 song\u2014even though I wish somebody would. I\u2019m worried that the kind of song I write, unlike hip-hop or something, might make that message seem less serious or more flippant, so I try to be a little bit more obscure.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is it acceptable in this day and age to be an artist who has no opinion, or who says, \u2018Oh, I just want to have fun and entertain people\u2019? I think of World War II, where there were these songs that were there just to entertain people, like \u2018Ain\u2019t We Got Fun\u2019\u2014light music so people could have fun, because it was not a fun time and they needed something to distract them. But now we have nothing but distraction. Now we have a thousand times the distractions we had in World War II, and I think, do I really want to add to them? It makes you think about pompous things like the role of the artist in society.\u201d\n\nIt comes out in songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Gonna Need Some Giants,\u201d which is \u201cjust about the politics of right now. You want somebody to come save us\u2014or the Mueller report is going to save us!\u2014but you realize nobody\u2019s going to come save us.\u201d The title of that song came about when Newman was playing a tape backward and heard himself singing what sounded like the title phrase. He then fashioned that into a song and had Caldwell sing those words\u2014forwards\u2014over his backwards version.\n\nThe first single, \u201cFalling Down the Stairs of Your Smile,\u201d has both light and serious origins. \u201cThere are so many songs like \u2018the something of love\u2019\u2014you know, there\u2019s \u2018The Book of Love,\u2019 \u2018The Freeway of Love\u2019\u2026Then I thought of \u2018falling down the stairs of your love,\u2019 and I thought, that kind of works. I think it has that element of how do you deal with the ideas of love and happiness in this world right now? When current events are stressful, that makes a stress on people\u2019s relationships, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to be happy in this loving relationship in this world that seems ugly at every turn, which is not as easy as it seems. Of course, \u2018love\u2019 ultimately morphed into \u2018smile,\u2019 but I like the metaphor of love as something that you fall down.\u201d\n\nFalling, or imminent crashing\u2026it\u2019s all related in The New Pornographer\u2019s \u201cMorse Code\u201d worldview. But there is more than one interpretation to many of the songs, as Newman points out with \u201cYou Won\u2019t Need Those Where You\u2019re Going,\u201d the emancipating title of which could portend either fleeing into the arms of a freeing love or doom. \u201cIt can be both, you know,\u201d he points out. \u201cI like that ambivalence. And considering I start each line with \u2018my love,\u2019 I guess it's a love song. Just because you have found a love doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not doomed, and just because you\u2019re doomed doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t find love.\u201d\n\nIn the end, for all its automotive motifs, In the Morse Code of Brake Lights is the opposite of something like a traditional rock & roll \u201cThunder Road.\u201d But for Newman, there is catharsis is in the traveling, even if there is no exit. \u201cThe longer I play music,\u201d he says, \u201cI realize how much just defiance there is in all the music I've always made. Not just against some societal injustice, but also just defying sadness, or defying your lot in life. I want to use music to get to a better place, which is what I\u2019ve always done, I realize. It\u2019s a way to reach out of yourself.\u201d The album may not offer an escape from these sometimes terrifying modern times, but it\u2019s a hell of a revivifying rest stop.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Luna-C", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/248346.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sat Feb 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Once Upon A So Stoked: Fantasy Rave 2020 ft.

Purchase & Stream at https://mavisstaples.ffm.to/wegetby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the messenger,\u201d Mavis Staples says on the eve of her 80th birthday. \u201cThat\u2019s my job\u2014it has been for my whole life\u2014and I can\u2019t just give up while the struggle\u2019s still alive. We\u2019ve got more work to do, so I\u2019m going to keep on getting stronger and keep on delivering my message every single day.\u201d\n\nThat message\u2014a clarion call to love, to faith, to justice, to brotherhood, to joy\u2014lies at the heart of \u2018We Get By,\u2019 Staples\u2019 spectacular twelfth studio album and first full-length collaboration with multi-GRAMMY Award-winner Ben Harper. Backed by her longtime touring band, Staples breathes extraordinary life into Harper\u2019s compositions on the record, delivering roof-raising performances with both a youthful vigor and a commanding maturity. The arrangements here are spare but weighty, matched by Harper\u2019s suitably lean and thoughtful production, and Staples seizes the opportunity to showcase her remarkable and continued evolution as an artist, one still growing and exploring more than half a century into her storied career. \u2018We Get By\u2019 is undoubtedly a timely collection, arriving such as it does in the face of deep social divisions and heightened political tensions, but like everything Staples touches, it\u2019s also larger than any particular moment, a timeless appeal to the better angels of our nature that\u2019s universal in its reach and unwavering in its assurance of better things to come.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started reading the lyrics Ben wrote for me, I said to myself, \u2018My God, he\u2019s saying everything that needs to be said right now,\u2019\u201d Staples remembers. \u201cBut the songs were also true to my journey and the stories I\u2019ve been singing all my life. There\u2019s a spirituality and an honesty to Ben\u2019s writing that took me back to church.\u201d\n\nHailed by NPR as \u201cone of America\u2019s defining voices of freedom and peace,\u201d Staples is the kind of once-in-a-generation artist whose impact on music and culture would be difficult to overstate. She\u2019s both a Blues and a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer; a civil rights icon; a GRAMMY Award-winner; a chart-topping soul/gospel/R&B pioneer; a National Arts Awards Lifetime Achievement recipient; and a Kennedy Center honoree. She marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., performed at John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration, and sang in Barack Obama\u2019s White House. She\u2019s collaborated with everyone from Prince and Bob Dylan to Arcade Fire and Hozier, blown away countless festivalgoers from Newport Folk and Glastonbury to Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, performed with The Band at The Last Waltz, and graced the airwaves on Fallon, Colbert, Ellen, Austin City Limits, Jools Holland, the GRAMMYs, and more. At a time when most artists begin to wind down, Staples ramped things up, releasing a trio of critically acclaimed albums in her 70\u2019s with Wilco\u2019s Jeff Tweedy that prompted Pitchfork to rave that \u201cher voice has only gained texture and power over the years\u201d and People to proclaim that she \u201cprovides the comfort of a higher power.\u201d In between records with Tweedy, Staples teamed up with a slew of other younger artists\u2014Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon, Nick Cave, Valerie June, tUnE-yArDs, and M. Ward among others\u2014for \u2018Livin\u2019 On A High Note,\u2019 an album The Boston Globe called \u201cstunningly fresh and cutting edge\u201d and which first introduced her to Harper.\n\n\u201cBen wrote a song for that album called \u201cLove and Trust,\u2019\u201d explains Staples. \u201cWhen he said he that he wanted to produce me, I told him, \u2018Well shucks, if you write another song like that, count me in.\u2019\u201d\n\nHarper did more than write just another song, instead penning an entire album of emotionally riveting and spiritually uplifting tracks that hit Staples directly in the heart. The tunes fit her like a glove\u2014due in no small part to the decades Harper spent listening to Staples\u2019s music, both with The Staple Singers and as a solo artist\u2014and Staples found herself fighting back tears as she fell in love with the beauty and sincerity of those early stripped down demos.\n\n\u201cI come from a family of Mavis fans,\u201d explains Harper, \u201cso her music has been woven into the fabric of my life from the very start. When I got the call for this gig, it felt like my entire career, everything I\u2019d ever written, had been pre-production for this.\u201d\n\nLeading up to the recording sessions, Harper sat in the audience for several of Staples\u2019 concerts, approaching her performances now as a student more than a fan. As brilliant as Staples\u2019 studio output was over the years, Harper came to understand the stage as her home and her touring band as her family, and capturing as much of that spirit as possible seemed like the obvious approach for \u2018We Get By.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much soul and Muscle Shoals in that band,\u201d explains Harper. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a specific chemistry that I recognized instantly. When you have a guitar player like Rick Holmstrom, a bass player like Jeff Turmes, a drummer like Stephen Hodges, and a vocalist like Donny Gerrard all supporting the voice of the century, why would you ever want to go outside of that foundation?\u201d\n\nWith Harper at the helm, the band recorded everything live at Henson Studio in Hollywood, CA, capturing the kind of powerhouse energy and deep pocket grooves that have come to define Staples\u2019 legendary concerts. While Harper had a distinct vision for the sound of the record, he purposely kept his demos to skeletal sketches, leaving space for Mavis and the band to interpret and give flight to his songs in the inimitable way that only they could.\n\n\u201cThe more I\u2019ve produced over the years, the more I\u2019ve heightened my sensitivity to what different artists require,\u201d reflects Harper. \u201cEvery artist and every album is different. With Mavis, sometimes the most important thing you can do is press record and just get the hell out of the way.\u201d\n\nThe record opens with the stirring \u201cChange,\u201d which finds Staples proclaiming, \u201cSay it loud say it clear / Gotta change around here\u201d over a simmering, fuzzed-out guitar line. It\u2019s a song focused as much internally as it is externally, and after one listen, it\u2019s plain to see why Staples and Harper referred to the studio\u2019s vocal booth as the \u201cprayer room.\u201d Staples\u2019 performance is hypnotic, holy even, restrained in its delivery but relentless in its urgency, and it lays the groundwork for an album that insists on joy and communal celebration without pulling any punches or sugarcoating any ugly truths. The funky \u201cAnytime\u201d looks fearlessly to the future, while the rousing \u201cBrothers and Sisters\u201d is a call for action in the face of injustice, and the gritty \u201cStronger\u201d promises there\u2019s no power in this world greater than our love for one another.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to listen to a voice like Staples\u2019 without contemplating all she\u2019s been through in her life\u2014the album cover features a heartrending Gordon Parks photo that speaks to the casual cruelty of racial segregation in 1950\u2019s Alabama\u2014but it only serves to make her optimism and resilience that much more inspiring and contagious. There is darkness and doubt on the album to be sure (the spirit of Pops Staples informs the mournful \u201cHeavy On My Mind,\u201d which recognizes that some wounds never heal, while the poignant \u201cNever Needed Anyone\u201d stings with the pain of lingering regret) but it\u2019s consistently overpowered by hope and conviction. \u201cBeen holding on too long to let go / Running too hard to slow down / Believing too deep to not have faith,\u201d Staples confesses on the soulful \u201cOne More Change To Make.\u201d In that sense, the album\u2019s title is more than just an observation. When Staples and Harper join forces to sing \u201cWe Get By,\u201d it\u2019s a prayer, a promise, an invitation.\n\n\u201cI sing because I want to leave people feeling better than I found them,\u201d Staples concludes. \u201cI want them to walk away with a positive message in their hearts, feeling stronger than they felt before. I\u2019m singing to myself for those same reasons, too.\u201d\n\nEven the messenger needs a reminder every now and then.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1100 Valley House Dr, Rohnert Park, CA 94928", "Artist": "Phil Johnson and Roadside Attraction Comedy and Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6401870.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.67991, 38.32188], "Date": "Sat Feb 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-01", "Genre": "Genres: Standup, Comedy Rock, Comedy, Standup Comedy, Funny, Humor, Spoken, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Sally Tomatoes", "moreBioInfo": "Phil Johnson is a man who gets mistaken for a woman, but only by those not paying attention.

For another, this is obviously an all-female band\u2014\u201cgirl groups\u201d usually being the novel province of youthful upstarts, not mature singer/songwriters. Splitting the frontperson status among three of four members goes against the agreed-upon maxim (agreed upon by everyone but the Beatles, anyway) that every group needs a single strong focal point. And didn\u2019t they get the memo that women in particular in show biz are supposed to be packing it in at this point, not making fresh introductions? Actually, they did get that memo, and put it in the proverbial circular file. www.BLAMESALLY.com - www.twitter.com/blamesally - http://blamesally.com/connect/email", "otherInfo": "Blame Sally"}, {"Address": "222 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Franc D'Ambrosio", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9263308.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.409274, 37.785697], "Date": "Sat Feb 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-01", "Genre": "Genres: Opera, Musical Theater, Musicals, Broadway", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Feinstein's at The Nikko", "moreBioInfo": "Best-known for his impressive portrayal of the lead role in Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Tony Award-winning musical, The Phantom of the Opera, Franc D\u2019Ambrosio performed as the famed masked man more than 2,000 times. Affectionately known as the \u201cIron Man of the Mask,\u201d Franc held the title of \u201cThe World\u2019s Longest-Running Phantom\u201d for more than a decade after bringing over five million theatre-goers to their feet in a 6-1/2-year run.\n\nBut that distinction only scratches the surface of an illustrious career spanning decades, including his portrayal of the opera-singing Anthony Corleone, son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton\u2019s characters in the seven-time Academy Award-nominated film Godfather III. Franc also sang the Academy Award-winning theme song \"Speak Softly Love\" for both the film and Original Motion Picture soundtrack, garnering over one million hits on YouTube. Paramount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search for the young Corleone, auditioning more than 2,000 artists over a one-year period before casting Franc in the role. He is the first and only person ever to sing Carmine Coppola\u2019s haunting Godfather theme in the film trilogy.\n\nFranc\u2019s performance of the song so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to study at Pavarotti\u2019s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously studied at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of \u201cTony\u201d in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow\u2019s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical.\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s BROADWAY: Songs from the Great White Way, and Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, along with tributes to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, including NBC\u2019s \u201cBrian Boitano\u2019s Skating Spectacular\u201d and \u201cThe 2005 Tribute to Music on Ice\u201d with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc\u2019s performance of \u201cMusic of the Night,\u201d as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening\u2019s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nIn May 2018, Franc was honored to receive a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival.

It worked, as fans quickly realized there was much more going on here than your average college party band.\n\n\n\nBy the early \u201870s, the band\u2019s unrelenting drive, as well as non-stop touring and recording, jump-started the burgeoning rock movement in the Midwest. It carved a path that was eventually followed by STYX, Kansas, Cheap Trick and more. Platinum albums and freeform FM radio staples such as \u201cRidin\u2019 The Storm Out\u201d followed, setting the stage for 1980\u2019s explosive Hi Infidelity. REO rode the top of the charts with a RIAA-certified 22 million albums sold in the U.S. and 40 million around the globe, with a string of gold and platinum records and international hit singles.\n\n\n\nEven now, fully established with songs on the radio in every city and town they ever set foot in, REO Speedwagon still has that Midwest work ethic. The band has gone on stage and in the studio to work\u2013 dozens of albums, thousands of concerts, and countless radio spins. Their eyes have always been on the future and on the road \u2013 not a year has gone by where REO Speedwagon didn\u2019t perform live, thrilling fans with hit filled sets.\n\n\n\nThe band\u2019s younger fans might not realize the sheer impact REO has had on music and the culture of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Hi Infidelity\u2019s millions in sales were fueled by massive hit singles such as \u201cKeep On Loving You\u201d and \u201cTake It On the Run.\u201d Thirty\u2013plus years later, the nine-times certified platinum Hi Infidelity still remains a high-water mark for rock bands; the album spent 15 weeks in the #1 slot, a feat simply unattainable in music today.\n\n\n\nAt the center of REO\u2019s desire to keep it rocking for the fans is Kevin Cronin, who looks like he\u2019s found the fountain of youth--along with the secret to penning some of the biggest hits in rock. With bandmates Bruce Hall on bass, keyboardist Neal Doughty, Dave Amato on lead guitar and drummer Bryan Hitt, REO has remained busy since the band celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007.\n\n\n\nAfter an eleven-year break from recording, REO Speedwagon released Find Your Own Way Home in 2007, marking the band's 15th studio effort. Just two years later, REO teamed up with their fellow Midwestern rockers Styx to record the new single, \u201cCan\u2019t Stop Rockin\u2019,\u201d which was co-written by the two band\u2019s frontmen, Cronin and Tommy Shaw.\n\n\n\nLater that year, the tune became the title track for the Can\u2019t Stop Rockin\u2019 Tour, as REO Speedwagon hit the road with STYX and .38 Special to unite three of the hardest working bands in America. Sponsored by VH1 and Rock Band\u00ae, the tour was a recession-busting night of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, offering the best value of the year. At the close of 2009, not only did the trio of bands end up being nominated for the \u201cMost Creative Tour Package\u201d by Pollstar, but they were also one of the highest grossing, most successful shows of the year. In November 2009, REO Speedwagon celebrated the holidays with the release of Not So Silent Night...Christmas with REO Speedwagon.\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2010, REO teamed up with yet another rock icon, Pat Benatar, for the \u201cLove on the Run Tour,\u201d which brought the songs of these two historic rockers to stages all across America. The \u201cLove on the Run Tour\u201d took fans back to the early \u201880s explosion of hits, when both artists ruled the Billboard charts with #1 and Top 10 positions for the better part of the decade. While on the 2010 tour, REO announced the release of a 30th anniversary deluxe edition reissue of Hi Infidelity.\n\n\n\nIn the spring and summer of 2012, REO linked up with Styx and Ted Nugent for the Midwest Rock N' Roll Express tour. The trek kicked off May in Texas, and crossed the country before winding up in New York in July. The title of the tour was a tip-of-the-hat to Illinois-bred bands Styx (from Chicago) and REO, as well as Nugent, who has his roots in Detroit.\n\n\n\nHot on the heels of that successful run, the Midwest Rock N' Roll Express tour was back again in spring of 2013. The highly anticipated tour started on April 18 in Grand Forks, ND and hit more than 20 cites before wrapping in Burgettstown, PA a month later. During this tour, STYX and REO Speedwagon\u2019s Rock to the Rescue charity organization not only raised thousands of dollars for local charities at each tour stop, but they also raised $108,000 which will go directly to the Boston One Fund, helping victims of the Boston Marathon bombings.\n\n\n\nLive at Moondance Jam - the band\u2019s hit-filled performance from the country\u2019s premier classic rock festival, was released in both a Blu-ray and a deluxe edition (containing a CD and DVD in a glossy digipak) on November 19, 2013.\n\n\n\nIn December \u201813, REO unveiled the band\u2019s \u201cGreat Chicago Fire Hydrant\u201d as part of a citywide Chicago public art installation project to benefit the 100 Club Chicago. Shortly thereafter, REO Speedwagon and STYX organized Rock To The Rescue Extends A Hand To Those In Need, a benefit concert for the central Illinois communities that were affected by the devastating tornadoes there. This concert raised in excess of $400,000.\n\n\n\nSummer of \u201814 found the band kicking-off a co-headlining tour of two legendary rock bands, REO and Chicago. Before the cross-country tour kicked-off Kevin Cronin said, \"This tour promises to deliver some unique music from two bands who have made a ton of hit records, share that Midwest work ethic, and still refuse to sit back on their past accomplishments. Can you imagine the Chicago horn section on 'Roll With the Changes'? That would blow my mind!\u201d That came to fruition as fans across the country had their minds blown by a multi-song encore that brought both bands onstage together to rock out on a series of their respective greatest hits. The tour was such a crowd pleaser that one of these phenomenal performances is set to air on AXS TV March 8, 2015. Chicago and REO Speedwagon: Live at Red Rocks promises that viewers will be sure to sing along with \u201cRiding The Storm Out,\u201d \u201cFree,\u201d \u201cRoll With The Changes,\u201d \u201cDoes Anybody Really Know What Time It Is,\u201d \u201cKeep on Loving You,\u201d and \u201c25 or 6 to 4.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing another successful year of touring, which included their first ever co-headlining tour with Chicago, REO Speedwagon has lined up another round of shows which will began March 2015. REO\u2019s Family First tour, which kicked off with a sun-soaked date in Cancun, Mexico on March 21, before heading back to the U.S., includes less shows than a usual REO Speedwagon tour so the band members can spend more time at home with their loved ones...

This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint. She continues to tour and record as well as remaining a strong presence in her community, working with local youth as a vocal coach and mentor. She encourages them to follow their dreams to sing freely and wholeheartedly. -Written by Elle K. Productions 9x award-winning R&B/Soul music artist.

Biography: Emanate (Mioli Music // San Francisco) Emanate (Emily & Nate) fell in love with the mystique of electronic music at an early age. Nathan Vain knew right away what his future passion held when he acquired his first turntables at the age of 17. Emily Fox took a different route starting her journey in the music scene as an organizer and promoter. This endeavor lead to landing Nathan his first residency at a popular after hours spot back in 2001. A few years down the road and a desire for their success growing strong they moved to San Francisco together and started producing music as Emanate. Nathan enhanced his knowledge of music and the industry working at DanceRecords(dot)com from \u201804 to \u201809 as a Content Manager. That was followed by a stint interning at the Mothership / Dirtybird labels. He also spent some time at the DJTechTools office working with midi controllers and software. Emily has developed her understanding of Electronic music culture by throwing various events throughout San Francisco over the years. She also spent some time as a member of (a few) bands where she was writing songs, singing and playing keyboard. Emily\u2019s next logical step became DJing, as a way to expand her talents and performance needs. Following the path of natural evolution they started up their own label Mioli Music in 2010 (Move It Or Lose It). Since 2010 they\u2019ve released music as Emanate and individually. They have also signed various international artists on Mioli. Both Emanate and Mioli had a breakout year in 2013 when Kollektiv Turmstrasse charted their remixes of Lily Ackerman\u2019s \u201cAfrica\u201d and also their remix of TrAck\u2019s \u201cStay\u201d on Resident Advisor. Being featured, charted and played in DJ sets along with the likes of Stimming, Adriatique, Bonobo and David August was a milestone that validated their hard work and dedication, it also alerted the world of their arrival. A relocation to Berlin in early 2014 helped formulate and solidify their craft and sound. While in Berlin Emanate produced and released their debut album \u201cAlliance\u201d and played their first Live Show. The Alliance album was well received and featured on various music magazine websites and dance music blogs but also recognized by Emanate as an immensely developmental experience. With their follow up EP \u201cThrough It / Switchiz\u201d getting as much buzz as it has it looks like 2015 will be a door opening year for Emanate. From Techno, Tech House to Deep House you can expect a clever blend and balance of deep and edgy music.

Far from just programming beats that make you jack, his music is some of the most beautiful you will hear, with lush string arrangements, emotive pianos and golden synths coming together into soundscapes that will melt your heart as well as warm your soul. Building on the early success of releases like the Sunrise EP on InFin\u00e9, the first releases on Fist or Finger (the label he co-runs with fabric\u2019s Craig Richards) and the summer anthem that was 'Twilight' with vocalist Terri Walker on More Music, jozif was unsurprisingly snapped up by LA\u2019s suitably sultry Culprit records for a brace of EPs. Here he further refined his richly musical style with genre defying with releases like \u2018Standard Rising\u2019, the \u2018Lady B\u2019 EP and now the two-part Waikiki anthem. Since then he has been enlisted by the cultured likes of Mobilee, Suol and Compost for remixes, and the way he carefully permeates his music with such serene and slo-mo ambiance yet imbues each track with a cheeky dance floor bump has seen everyone from Sasha to Giles Peterson, Andrew Weatherall to Damian Lazarus fall in love. Having been a DJ since as far back as 1996, it made sense that the legendary Balance series came calling for jozif when they wanted to kick-off a new mix series in early 2013. What he turned in was a stunningly emotional and heartfelt mix that proved just how sensitive and soothing electronic music can be, at the same time, of course, as subtly making you move your body. For proof of his artistic ability in the booth, you only need ask anyone who has seen him play at places like Space Ibiza, Output New York & London\u2019s foremost fabric and many other festivals around Asia and both Americas. Currently putting the final touches to his debut artist album and accompanying Live show, whilst simultaneously releasing the Kerb Staller debut album alongside cohort and production partner Matt Tolfrey, 2017 is shaping up to be a \u2018Live\u2019 one.

The music is danceable but also worthy of focus to see their communication in real time. It is something special to bear witness to the birth of a band that could potentially take a scene by storm, you feel like you\u2019re in on something, witness to something great.\u201d - Glide Magazine\n\nMagic In The Other was born out of the idea that it is in the unknown where the most potent ground lays for magic and discovery. It is from this notion that this fresh-on-the-scene trio from Oakland, CA sets out to connect with their listeners, creating a mentally-stimulating, emotionally-resonate, highly-danceable, and distinctly-transformative experience where everyone feels just a little more magical.\n\nMITO assembled in early 2017, consisting of three in-demand Bay Area veterans - drummer and bandleader Ezra Lipp (Phil Lesh & Friends, Sean Hayes), bass player Steve Adams (ALO, Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers) and guitar wizard Roger Riedlbauer (Jolie Holland, Mercury Falls). Over the course of just a year, the trio has honed in on a contagious chemistry that beams with personality and is incredibly engaging to watch. It may be difficult to pin the band down to a specific genre, however, traces can be detected. Be it the rhythmic sophistication of jazz and West African music, the unrestrained spirit of rock n\u2019 roll, the compositional approach of western classical music, or the improvisatory intensity of North Indian ragas, the magic of the band ultimately lies in the skilled fusing of all of the above (and beyond) to create a sound fresh and unique all its own.\n\nIn the fall of their break-out year, while building a buzz on stages around the Bay Area and garnering their first set of loyal fans, Ezra, Steve and Roger crowd-funded nearly $20k to put toward the making of their first full-length album. Recorded at the legendary Tiny Telephone Studios, the debut captures the band\u2019s first batch of live-tested material, and is augmented by a few of their close musical friends as well as other fun studio surprises.

It speaks to our truest selves, binds us together with the ones we love, and brings out the best part of who we are. Bobby Jo Valentine is a singer/songwriter who chases after this particular kind of music. He writes songs that travel light, but that \u201cgrow deeper and deeper with each further listen\u201d, the music publication Soundtrack to My Day describes. The poetic nature and focus of his stories and songs is something that, along with notable awards, has resulted in an incredibly loyal following of true patrons to his art, supporting Bobby in every way as he seeks to write more music that means something good, and sounds like the beautiful, terrifying world that we live in.\n\nHope-folk. Soul-pop. Poetic rock. Bobby Jo Valentine\u2019s music exists outside the lines of any genre, but the music\u2019s thoughtful lyrics and catchy melodies reach listeners on all paths of life. The authentic, universal, uncanny nature of his songs have won him Song of the Year at West Coast Songwriter\u2019s Association three times \u2013 in 2011, 2015, and 2017. He\u2019s sold 18,000 albums and performed more than 1,000 concerts\u2014all without a record label\u2014and all because of devoted groups of fans and friends who grow in number after every concert.\n\nHis wide range of expression has made it hard for the industry to package, but it\u2019s the same reason his songs are gaining a loyal following around the nation. A few songs have broken through the static. Bobby\u2019s music has appeared on radio and television, including a commercial for the recent Ford Fusion \u00a9, ABC\u2019s The Morning Blend, and the award winning film The Groom\u2019s Cake. His music has received airplay from KGO, KRSH, and other radio stations nationwide.\n\nBorn into a Baptist church of strict lines and sharp edges, and coming out of that culture to discover who he really is, Bobby is now a believer of a different sort: a believer in the wild, strange, beautiful nature of the world. Faith has come to mean something much deeper, wider, and less cut-and-dried than when he started. Now, Bobby finds that he often has more to learn from the people who don\u2019t believe as he does than from those who do. Along with theatres, house concerts, and many other venues, churches around the nation frequently invite Bobby to offer his stories and songs, challenging us to question why we believe what we do and, most importantly, how that helps us be better humans in the world around us. Among others, he has been invited to perform for The Wild Goose Festival, the national Gay Christian Network conference, the international 2016 Emerge conference, the Kinship Festival, and the 2016 UCC Gathering in Southern California. He is ecstatic any time he can discuss the big questions, challenge the easy answers, and inspire people to move closer to love.\n\nSpeaking of love, Bobby loves a good love song, and is in great demand as a performer for weddings gay and straight, all over the country. He was named \u201cBest in 2015\u201d for ceremony music by The Knot, and has received more than 35 five-star reviews for his romantic, soulful singing.\n\nBobby is a proud supporter of equal rights for all people. He believes that we\u2019re all in this together; that \u201cthe arc of the universe is long, but bends toward justice\u201d; and that real justice means justice for everyone. Bobby is a constant supporter of LGBT rights and performs at Pride festivals and benefits and for LGBT youth programs all over the US. He has also been invited to perform for many child protection, child homelessness, and domestic violence prevention non-profits, including the national Safe Place Network.\n\nWhen he isn\u2019t touring the nation singing his songs for everyone who will listen, Bobby lives on the windy coastline of Northern California. His new albums \u201cFox Eyes, Whale Heart\u201d and \"Maybe Stars\" are available worldwide on iTunes and on his website.", "otherInfo": "Come enjoy stories and songs about discovering yourself, finding peace in the middle of unanswered questions, and living a colorful, flourishing life!

He has performed with such notables as Terri Lyne Carrington, Ellis Marsalis, Tyshawn Sorey, Esperanza Spalding, Jimmy Cobb, Nicholas Payton, Christian Scott, Stefon Harris, Allen Toussaint, Freddy Cole, Russell Gunn, Amina Figarova, Wallace Roney, and Buster Williams.\n\nGuerin was born in Metairie, Louisiana and moved to Atlanta at age 11. Growing up in a family of musicians, Morgan was given his first pair of drumsticks at the age of six months, followed shortly thereafter by a drum set. By six, Morgan had his first saxophone. With his mother being a pianist and his father being a bassist, Morgan began playing piano and bass early on. His debut record \u201cThe Saga\u201d was released in 2016. It featured Guerin performing the majority of the instruments on the record. Since moving to New York in 2016 and attending the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, Morgan had the great fortune of joining Terri Lyne Carrington\u2019s band, \u201cSocial Science\u201d where he plays electric bass, saxophone and EWI in the group.\n\nThe Huffington Post named Morgan\u2019s first album, \u201cThe Saga\u201d one of the best Jazz albums of 2016 and Stereo Gum showcased his sophomore album, \u201cThe Saga II\u201d in their August article for their favorite albums. He has also been featured in Downbeat Magazine, New York Times and Burning Ambulance. In 2018, Jammcard selected Morgan as one of their \u201c20 under 20\u201d artists.\n\nMorgan now performs regularly with Terri Lyne Carrington and Social Science, Esperanza Spalding, Amina Figarova Sextet and Tyshawn Sorey. Also an active mixing engineer, Morgan has helped engineer albums from artists such as Justin Brown, Jesse Fischer, Gr\u00fct and Fullmoon Groove. During the fall of 2018, Morgan joined Esperanza Spalding on her \u201c12 Little Spells\u201d tour and played bass, Prophet, saxophone, bass drum and sang background vocals. Morgan was a part of her record, \u201c12 Little Spells\u201d and composed the song \u201cHow To\u201d from the record with Spalding.\n\nBefore starting college, Morgan was a member of the Rialto Youth Jazz Orchestra (Directed by Gordon Vernick) from 2010-2016. He studied at the Berklee College of Music in Boston the summers of 2014 and 2015, was a member of the 2014 Vail Jazz Workshop, and performed at The Monterey Jazz Festival as a member of the Next Generation Jazz Orchestra in 2015 and 2016.

His sound breaks aways from the various subgenres of EDM but holds onto origins of dubstep and hip-hop, creating a truly authentic experience for his audience. Early on in his career Minnesota said, \u201cMy goal is to make bass heavy dubstep/glitch-hop music that\u2019ll get you dancing, but it is not the same old three note transformer step\u2026 I try to focus more on the melodic side of dubstep, and hopefully, make quality songwriting a more relevant factor in the genre.\u201d For the past four years Minnesota has followed through on his word and designed smooth, melodic, uplifting sounds, which fans have celebrated nationwide.\n\n\n\nOriginally from Minneapolis, MN, Christian Bauhofer moved to Santa Cruz, CA when he was 18 years old. Fresh out of the Midwest, his newfound California friends gave him the nickname \u2018Minnesota,\u2019 and unknowingly created his soon-to-be party crushing alter ego. He learned the guitar at age 12 and made numerous attempts to form a band, but it wasn\u2019t until he attended Symbiosis Gathering for the first time in 2009 that his career in music became clear. The festival drew him into the emerging EDM culture with performances by Bassnectar, Pretty Lights and the Glitch Mob. Shortly after Symbiosis, Minnesota purchased Ableton Live and his first midi controller, and within a few months was making hip-hop remixes that his friends couldn\u2019t stop playing. Around the same time, Minnesota teamed up with a couple friends and started a production company called Vital SC (now Vital Events). The company had a successful start, hosting a string shows around the Bay Area with big name artists. But Minnesota eventually split off from the promoting side of the industry in pursuit of his musical career\u2014and today he couldn\u2019t be happier with his decision.\n\n\n\nMinnesota\u2019s first EP, Panda Snatching Tycoon, came out on Tycho Records in January 2011. It received critical acclaim from a national audience, prompting Minnesota to drop his second official album, Ancient Machines EP, just months after. Released on Mal Label, Ancient Machines hit number nine on the Addictech.com best seller\u2019s list for 2011 and every track appeared on the Beatport.com glitch-hop charts. During this time, Minnesota also managed to put out a free EP with MartyParty called Ultraviolet Halo that was released in July 2011. His fourth EP, Astral Projection, came out the following year and showcased his affinity for downtempo melodic ethereal sounds, which diversified his fan-base through hits like \u201cStardust,\u201d and \u201cRelax.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s fifth album, Altered States EP, has since been his most popular with tracks being played by DJs across the country. He describes the album as, \u201cbig room, melodic bangers,\u201d with some, \u201cfaster tempo hip hop influenced stuff on it.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s most recent release Voyager EP resonates as a culmination of these projects, balancing his identifiable melodic synths with the bounce of 808\u2019s. The album, fine-tuned with experience and precision, plays naturally in the evolution of Minnesota\u2019s signature sound.\n\n\n\nNow in his fourth year of touring, Minnesota has traveled to over 50 cities and performed at nearly every major festival nationwide. Last year he headlined his first two tours, and performed with the likes of STS9, Big Gigantic, MiMOSA and Gramatik. His music has been lauded by the likes of Bassnectar, Adventure Club, Paper Diamond and many others in his genre. Discussing Minnesota\u2019s track \u201cPush It,\u201d Bassnectar once commented, \u201c[It\u2019s] quickly becoming a staple in my sets,\u201d and \u201cperfect for when I need a track that is epic and churning but also melodically hyped.\u201d The support of Minnesota\u2019s management team, agency, and some of the world\u2019s greatest artists can only attribute to his hunger for more time spent on the road and in the studio. To those that haven\u2019t had the opportunity to see Minnesota perform, make sure to be on the lookout for the next time he rolls into your city. To put it lightly, Minnesota is a name to watch.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "230 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Thelem", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8911063.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.822691, 38.40115], "Date": "Sun Feb 2 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-02", "Genre": "Genres: Dubstep, Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "HopMonk Tavern Sebastopol", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Minnesota (ON-WED 11/6/2019 10am)"}, {"Address": "2000 Denmark St, Sonoma, CA 95476", "Artist": "Courtney Barnett", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8621615.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.417165, 38.280988], "Date": "Sun Feb 2 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-02", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative Rock, Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Gundlach Bundschu Winery", "moreBioInfo": "Listen: https://courtney-barnett.lnk.to/listen\n\nSpecial edition of debut album, Sometimes I Sit And Think And Sometimes I Just Sit is out now!\nAvailable as LP, CD, and a digital collection, the new edition features previously unreleased live takes recorded at New York's Electric Lady Studios.\nLP: http://smarturl.it/CBdeluxevinyl\nCD: http://smarturl.it/SometimesDeluxe-Am\nDigital: http://smarturl.it/CB-SometimesDeluxe\nBoth the boxset and the LP come packaged with a poster of the album artwork, as well as four Polaroid photos taken by Barnett and a download card for her cover of John Cale's \"Close Watch\", which is also included on the vinyl edition of the release.\n\nCourt\u2019s debut album, Sometimes I Sit And Think And Sometimes I Just Sit is out now!\nOrder here www.courtneybarnett.com.au.\n\nFollow\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/courtneymelba\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/courtneymelba\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/user/milkrecordsmelbourne\n\nCourtney Barnett puts a lot of effort into sounding effortless.

Affectionately known as the \u201cIron Man of the Mask,\u201d Franc held the title of \u201cThe World\u2019s Longest-Running Phantom\u201d for more than a decade after bringing over five million theatre-goers to their feet in a 6-1/2-year run.\n\nBut that distinction only scratches the surface of an illustrious career spanning decades, including his portrayal of the opera-singing Anthony Corleone, son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton\u2019s characters in the seven-time Academy Award-nominated film Godfather III. Franc also sang the Academy Award-winning theme song \"Speak Softly Love\" for both the film and Original Motion Picture soundtrack, garnering over one million hits on YouTube. Paramount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search for the young Corleone, auditioning more than 2,000 artists over a one-year period before casting Franc in the role. He is the first and only person ever to sing Carmine Coppola\u2019s haunting Godfather theme in the film trilogy.\n\nFranc\u2019s performance of the song so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to study at Pavarotti\u2019s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously studied at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of \u201cTony\u201d in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow\u2019s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical.\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s BROADWAY: Songs from the Great White Way, and Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, along with tributes to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, including NBC\u2019s \u201cBrian Boitano\u2019s Skating Spectacular\u201d and \u201cThe 2005 Tribute to Music on Ice\u201d with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc\u2019s performance of \u201cMusic of the Night,\u201d as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening\u2019s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nIn May 2018, Franc was honored to receive a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival. He has released three successful solo CDs, one of which has the unique distinction as the soundtrack for Barry Manilow\u2019s daily workout. In addition to his one-man shows, Franc is also currently touring the world with The Four Phantoms In Concert.", "otherInfo": "On February 3, Franc D\u2019Ambrosio will be honored at a special knighting ceremony hosted by Lorenzo Ortona, Consul General of Italy, at the Italian Consulate in San Francisco, where he will be officially designated as Il Cavaliere dell\u2019Ordine della Stella della Solidarieta\u2019 Italiana (The Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity).
