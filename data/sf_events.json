Combining Thomas\u2019s arranging ideas and skilled instrumental work with Andrija\u2019s studio full of vintage mics, tube amps, keyboards, and tape machines, the resulting record has a rich, buttery warmth well-suited to Miss Tess's voice and authentic, retro-contemporary songwriting style.\nAfter over a decade on the road, now making her home in Nashville \u2014 by way of Baltimore, Boston, and Brooklyn \u2014 Miss Tess has found a creative community that encourages and embraces wide artistic exploration and expression as much as she does.\n\n\u201cMiss Tess swings and swaggers, rooted in a retro groove that\u2019s equal parts blues, mid-century rock & roll and Booker T-worthy R&B.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cOld-time warmth, 21st-century sass.

Baez rose to prominence in the early '60s with her stunning renditions of traditional balladry.\n\nIn the late '60s and early '70s, Baez came into her songwriting own, penning many songs (most notably \"Diamonds & Rust,\" a nostalgic piece about her ill-fated romance with Bob Dylan, and \"Sweet Sir Galahad,\" a song about her late sister Mimi Fari\u00f1a's second marriage) and continued to meld her songcraft with topical issues. She was outspoken in her disapproval of the Vietnam war and later the CIA-backed coups in many Latin American countries.\n\nShe was also instrumental in the Civil Rights movement, marching with Dr. Martin Luther King on many occassions and being jailed for her beliefs. In 1963, her performance of \"We Shall Overcome\" at the Lincoln Memorial just prior to Dr. King's famous \"I Have A Dream...\" speech helped turn the song into a Civil Rights anthem.\n\nIn December 1972, she traveled to Hanoi, North Vietnam, and was caught in that country's \"Christmas Campaign,\" in which the U.S. bombed the city more times than any other during the entire war. While pregnant with her only son, Gabriel, she performed a handful of songs in the middle of the night on day one of the 1969 Woodstock festival. She is considered the \"Queen of Folk\" for being at the forefront of the 1960s folk revival and inspiring generations of female folksingers that followed.

Four Tet shares some stylistic similarities with other musicians, such as Prefuse 73, who use computer editing techniques that give the music a staccato, cut-up feel. Hebden's music is notable for its rich, organic sounds and harmonious melodies as well as for eschewing the traditional pop-song format in favour of a more abstract approach.\n\nKieran Hebden began releasing material as Four Tet in 1998 with the 36 minute and 25 second single \"Thirtysixtwentyfive\" on Trevor Jackson's Output Recordings label. Later that year, he released a second single, the jazz-influenced \"Misnomer\". 1999's \"Dialogue\", again on Output, was Four Tet's first full-length album release and fused hip-hop drum lines with dissonant jazz samples. This was followed by the double A-side single \"Glasshead\"/\"Calamine\", which was to be Four Tet's last release on Output.\n\nIn late 1999, Warp Records released a tenth-anniversary compilation of remixes of Warp tracks; Hebden contributed a remix of \"Cliffs\", the opening track of Aphex Twin's \"Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II\". This relatively high profile exposure attracted a lot of new interest in Four Tet from fans of electronica and IDM, genres in which the Warp brand had a preeminent status.\n\nIn 2001, Four Tet's second album \"Pause\" was released on Domino and found Hebden using more folk and electronic samples, which was quickly dubbed \"folktronica\" by the media & press in an attempt to label the style (often also applied to artists such as ISAN, Gravenhurst and some of Canabrism's later work). The acoustic guitar track \"Everything Is Alright\" is the theme music for the National Public Radio talk show On Point, produced at WBUR in Boston, Massachusetts; it was also featured in a US Nike commercial in 2001-2002 and in the Sony Bravia commercial in 2005.\n\n\"Rounds\" was released in May 2003. It was Hebden's most ambitious album to date, incorporating diverse samples such as the mandolin on \"Spirit Fingers\", and even a rubber duck on the closing track \"Slow Jam\". Three singles were released from the album: \"She Moves She\", \"As Serious as Your Life\", and \"My Angel Rocks Back and Forth\". This last single was released as an EP featuring remixes by electronica duo Icarus and Isambard Khroustaliov along with additional Four Tet tracks \"I've Got Viking in Me\" and \"All the Chimers\". An accompanying DVD featured all of Four Tet's videos to date.\n\nAt the beginning of 2003, Four Tet opened for Radiohead on their European tour. A remix of the song Scatterbrain from Radiohead's latest album \"Hail to the Thief\" was included on their 2004 EP \"COM LAG (2plus2isfive)\".\n\nA live album named \"Live in Copenhagen 30th March 2004\" was released in April 2004 as a limited edition, available only through the Domino Records website.\n\nIn March and April of 2005, Four Tet performed two shows of improvisational music, in collaboration with jazz drummer Steve Reid, in Paris and London. He also appears on Steve Reid Ensemble 2005 album \"Spirit Walk\". This collaboration was extended into a series of international tours, and the release of two albums, \"The Exchange Session Vol. 1\" and \"The Exchange Session Vol. 2\" over the course of 2005 and 2006.\n\nHis fourth studio album \"Everything Ecstatic\" was released on Domino on 23 May 2005. The video for the lead single, \"Smile Around the Face\", features actor Mark Heap. The album brought with it another shift in style, leaving behind the breezy \"folktronica\" of \"Pause\" and \"Rounds\" for a darker, more complex sound. On 7 November 2005, Domino has released a DVD version of \"Everything Ecstatic\" featuring video clips for each track of the album plus a CD with new material.\n\nHebden has also remixed, under the Four Tet name, tracks by a wide range of artists including Madvillain, Bloc Party, Super Furry Animals, Beth Orton, Badly Drawn Boy, The Notwist, Boom Bip, Kings of Convenience, Explosions in the Sky, Radiohead, and Doves.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Robert Sarazin Blake LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7236706.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Singer-songwriter, Story Teller, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "On Tour Now! | http://robertsarazinblake.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Single Music LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10393100.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Single Music allows artists the opportunity to host live streams and bundle merchandise directly within their Shopify stores!

Patrice and Sister Seven toured the United States and Western Europe in support of three independent releases and three major label albums. From Sister Seven\u2019s jam-band beginnings to their Billboard-charting radio singles, they headlined clubs and supported major event tours.\n\nOver the years Patrice Pike performed onstage with many artists including Dave Matthews, Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Blues Traveler, the Allman Brothers and the Indigo Girls as well as opening sets for the late great Ray Charles, Cake, Soul Asylum, Cheap Trick, The Neville Brothers and more. The disbanding of Sister Seven and the release of her first full length solo studio album Fencing Under Fire as well as the recent live unplugged CD Live at the Brushwood Lounge has established Patrice Pike as one of the best independent artists today. Patrice recorded Fencing Under Fire with former band mate and co-owner of her label Zainwayne Records along with Jim Watts and Ethan Allan and released the album in 2002. Her single \u201cMs. Ramona\u201d was in the top ten most added on AAA stations for several weeks being the only totally independent album with no major label or major indie ties on the charts along side Sonny Landreth, Dar Williams, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and David Grey.\n\nPatrice\u2019s most recent success points to her songwriting skill, as she along with co-writers Wayne Sutton, Darrell Phillips, and Sean Phillips have been awarded Grand Prize Overall and First Prize Rock for their song \u201cMy Three Wishes\u201d in the USA Songwriting Competition. In the same competition \u201cNobody Knows\u201d took Top 10 in Pop. Her sense for lyrics and melody now winning international recognition, having competed with 32,500 entries from all over the world. Most recently Patrice\u2019s song \u201cUnraveling\u201d garnered an honorable mention in the 2005 Mountain Stage NewSong Contest, presented by Performing Songwriter magazine.\n\nIn 2006, Patrice appeared as a finalist on the CBS reality show Rock Star: Supernova, a show that documents the search of the band Supernova's new lead singer. Throughout the show, Patrice met a lot of positive review with her performances, including her showcase of her original song, \"Beautiful Thing.\" It was ultimately decided, however, that Patrice was not right for Supernova, and she was eliminated. Host Dave Navarro advised Patrice to seek a solo career, giving her a nod for her talent.

He first began performing with a gospel quartet while still attending high school in the nearby town of Sarepta. He continued to sing gospel throughout his years at Louisiana Tech University, where he studied petroleum technology. After working on an oil rig for a few years after leaving school, he embarked on what he calls his \"true musical education\" -- playing one honky-tonk after another. While singing at Tillie's & Lucy's Pub in Nashville, Adkins was spotted by a Capitol Records executive and was signed to the label.\n\nHis early singles steadily climbed the charts, and 1997's \"(This Ain't) No Thinkin' Thing\" became his first No. 1 hit. After enduring a label shake-up at Capitol in the late 1990s, the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Adkins resurfaced with the Top 10 hits \"More\" in 2000, \"I'm Tryin'\" in 2001 and \"Chrome\" in 2003.\n\nHe released his Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 in 2003, a few months before being inducted into the Grand Ole Opry. He also checked himself into a rehabilitation center for a drinking problem and concluded the year by releasing the studio album Comin' On Strong.\n\nIn 2005, Adkins landed a surprise smash hit with \"Honky Tonk Badonkadonk\" from his album Songs About Me, which sold nearly two million copies as a result. Dangerous Man was released in 2006.\n\n(biography is taken from http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/adkins_trace/bio.jhtml)", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/national-memorial-day-concert/home"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jack Everly LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620065.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/national-memorial-day-concert/home"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cece Winans LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616812.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/national-memorial-day-concert/home"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Krickets LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10392676.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Swamp Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Swamp Folk Girl Band", "otherInfo": "Livestream from The Krickets!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "toLoveandRescue LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9663688.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Austin, Texas", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Follow Jeremy and the music he writes and sings, performing under the name toLoveandRescue.

Formed several years ago by twins Roger and Logan Raskin, the union originally began as a mere writing project for producer Greg Ladany. But after several demos were cut and the brothers realized they were on to something, it became a permanent proposition, and the Raskins were born.\n\nAnd while seemingly the majority of today's chart toppers are sonically one-dimensional, the Raskins are a throwback to the days of when bands weren't as confined stylistically. Case in point, the bros list such wide-ranging artists as Kiss, the Buzzcocks, Jim Croce, the Temptations, Mel Torme, and Jane's Addiction as influences. As a result, the \"rock/retro/alternative/pop-rock/singer-songwriter\" tag that the Raskins like to go by is indeed well fitting.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, and fans will be able to experience the Raskins on a pair of nearby speakers soon, as the duo's self-titled debut album was just released, while the leadoff single, \"We Had It All,\" dropped during their Spring tour with Scot Weiland. Songs such as \"We Had It All,\" \"Need Another Hero,\" and \"The Radio Song\" show the retro rock side of the band, while songs like \"Open Our Eyes,\" \"Reach,\" and \"Where Do We Go From Here\" show the diversity of the band's songwriting with acoustic type pop rock ballads.\n\n\"The first radio single and video we decided to go with was 'We Had It All',\" explains Roger. \"This song definitely shows a sound of the band which is most consistent with our biggest rock influences as well as the song being written with a specific topic in mind.\" And according to Logan, a follow-up single has already been selected. \"The second single will be 'The Radio Song,' which is a simple story written about a group of guys grinding with their band on the road - this being us - then all of a sudden, they hear their song on the radio for the first time and how that suddenly changes everything for them, mostly emotionally. We always wanted to write a song about that - most musicians can relate as well as most fans understanding that crucial emotion every musician yearns for.\"\n\nAs for the Raskins' plans once the album is released, it is a simple one, according to Roger. \"Clearly the future plans for the Raskins is to tour as much as possible, and bring our music to every city in the US, as well as all the local radio stations, doing promotional giveaways, rock shows, and signings for all our fans. We want to show the public that we our very accessible. Also eventually heading over to Europe to give our expanded fan base the opportunity to experience the Raskins live. The Europeans love them some rock n roll. Can't wait to share our music with all of them!\"\n\nLastly, Logan unveils that both the music and the bond of brotherhood will prevail for the Raskins. \"We work and strive extremely hard for success with our music. Through all the ups and downs, the trials and tribulations, the acceptances and denials. We always have each other. That is the main focus of the Raskins. We are doing music because we love it and it's our passion. For us we feel we have already had major success because we are doing what we love most in the world to do - write and perform our music for the world to see.\"Thus helping set the standard for the Raskins and continuing on this wonderful musical journey and allowing the world to enjoy all our music.\nWe love you all\n\nFor further information go to www.TheRaskins.com", "otherInfo": "Join The Raskins live online Sunday May24th 6pm PT 9pm ET for their long awaited acoustic performance.

The four original members, Scott Blasey (vocals, acoustic guitar), Rob James (6 and 12-string electric guitars, vocals), Greg Joseph (bass, vocals) and David Minarik (drums, vocals) are joined by fellow touring mates Gary Jacob, Skip Sanders and Noah Minarik, tossing out some spanking pedal steel, Hammond organ and tasty guitar. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had more fun composing and recording songs,\u201d says bass player Greg Joseph. \u201cWith our storied recording history, it\u2019s really heartening to know that music can still captivate the band as much as it has on this album.\u201d\n\nWith a highlight reel that includes the Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and others, The Clarks are enjoying their stage time together now more than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s one big extended family,\u201d says guitarist Rob James. \u201cDave\u2019s son Noah plays on this album, and with us live, so saying that isn\u2019t just a metaphor, it\u2019s fact!\u201d Singing and playing the songs of Madly In Love At The End Of The World has rekindled a fire in The Clarks\u2019 sometimes broken, sometimes mended hearts.\n\nThe Clarks are:\nScott Blasey: Lead Vocals, Electric & Acoustic Guitars\nRobert James: Electric & Acoustic Guitars, Vocals\nGreg Joseph: Bass Guitar, Vocals\nDave Minarik: Drums, Vocals", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nathan Aweau LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8683510.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Hawaiian", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Known for his hauntingly beautiful vocals (he\u2019s won Male Vocalist of the Year honors three times - more than any other artist), it isn\u2019t surprising to learn that Hawaiian singer/songwriter/composer/producer Nathan Aweau was born into a musical family. His grandparents played a variety of instruments; his mother played piano; and his father taught music and was a choir director. In addition to possessing a natural ability to sing, Aweau\u2019s early years consisted of piano, guitar, and \u2018ukulele lessons, followed by saxophone, percussion, and bass.\n\nHe began his professional career in college, accompanying such well-known performers as Gabe Baltazar, Henry Kapono, Loyal Garner, and Nohelani Cypriano, followed by stints as a member of the award-winning groups Ka`eo (1984-1988), The Ali\u2019i\u2019s (1989-1994), and Hapa (2003-2010). He was also the musical director for the legendary Don Ho for 16 years, and has worked with national artists such as Jerry Brown (drummer for Lionel Richie and Stanley Clarke), and Ron Lee (drummer for Barry Manilow).\n\nAweau also taught music at high school and college seminars, covering subjects ranging from writing, arranging, and sequencing to computer music. In one project he gave Hawai\u2019i high school students the chance to experience the process of producing and recording a song.\n\nIn addition to being a stage musician, Aweau has played for a variety of commercials and provided background music for a number of shows on the Travel Channel. A seasoned music producer, he has worked extensively in the studio producing, arranging, and performing for various large projects, commercials, radio stations, and other artists.\n\nBeloved by fans, Aweau is a natural storyteller with a somewhat self-deprecating sense of humor. His audiences love his explanations of the inspiration behind his songs. He is also highly respected by fellow musicians. The late John Koko, long-time member of the highly popular, multiple-award winning Hawaiian music group The Makaha Sons, once said, \u201cNathan Aweau ... Incredible Bass Player \u2026 Irresistible Voice... Incomparable Entertainer! The CD \u2018Kane`ohe\u2019 will take you on a musical journey that is Haunting...Refreshing... Powerful and Exciting.\u201d\n\nThe respect of other professionals in the music industry is also evidenced by the fact that Aweau has received numerous nominations and awards for his work, both as a solo artist and as part of a group. His 2001 release E Apo Mai received multiple N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards (Hawaii\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae), including Male Vocalist of the Year and Hawaiian Album of the Year. He also received Song of the Year honors at the Hawai\u2019i Music Awards for the album\u2019s title track.\n\n2005 saw Aweau again honored with multiple awards, as both a solo artist and as part of the group Hapa. His passion for the electric bass was expressed in his Bass Etude CD, which was voted Jazz Album of the Year. And Hapa\u2019s Maui CD, which shot up Billboard\u2019s World Music chart (peaking at number 7), received awards for Album of the Year, Contemporary Album of the Year, Graphics, and Engineering. Aweau was also honored with his second award for Male Vocalist of the Year for his album The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series - Vintage.\n\nIn 2006 Aweau received his third Male Vocalist of the Year award, for his The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series \u2013 Hula CD. In the 39 year history of the N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards, he remains the only artist to receive the honor three times.\n\nIn 2008 Aweau released \u201cKane\u2019ohe\u201d - the long-awaited follow up to \u201cE Apo Mai\u201d \u2013 which was comprised of songs that celebrate the place that he calls home. He wrote all twelve songs, played every instrument, sang all the background parts, and engineered, mixed, and mastered the entire CD.\n\nHis December 2015 release \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is yet another all-original album, filled with songs inspired by his beloved Hawai\u2019i, his first grandchild, Queen Lili\u2019uokalani, and more. As was the case for his other solo releases, \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is 100% Aweau.

Their sound, an epic and cinematic dark-pop, is fused with a wide variety of influences including alternative, indie-rock, K-pop, and J-pop.\n\n\nWhile many assume that the sisters have been playing music together since birth, Crimson Apple formed the summer of 2012. The girls have always viewed the formation of the band as an act of fate; Each sister picked up their respective instruments and found their love of music at different stages in their lives. One day, they realized that together, they made up the perfect pieces of a whole band.\n\n\nAfter performing in numerous venues in their beautiful home of Hawaii, the sisters decided to relocate to Los Angeles in 2015 to further pursue their music careers. Within a year of the move, they became regular performers for Disneyland and shortly after signed recording- and management deals with Amuse Group USA, Inc.\n\n\nCrimson Apple has since been making music and touring multiple festivals and venues across America, opening for major acts such as The Chainsmokers, The Plain White T's, and All Time Low. Their passion can be felt in their hard-hitting live performances and their debut EP, \"Somebody\", where the band has worked devotedly to create a strong, cohesive image and sound that reflects their bond as sisters.\n\n\nWith the release of \"Break Your Heart Worse\" on May 22, Crimson Apple uses a dark, twisted love story to introduce the next phase of their evolution as a band.\n\n\nCRIMSON APPLE is:\n\n\nColby Benson - Lead Vocals\nShelby Benson - Guitar / Vocals\nCarthi Benson - Bass / Vocals\nFaith Benson - Drums / Vocals", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The David Wax Museum LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8227319.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Mexican Folk, Folk, Mexo-americana, Americana, Latin Folk, Indie Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Suz and I started this band as friends,\" says David Wax, \"but now we\u2019re married and have a child and have our family on the road with us. The stakes are different.\"\n\nThose stakes are what lie at the heart of David Wax Museum's fourth and boldest studio album to date, \"Guesthouse.\" It's the sound of a band reconciling the accountability of marriage and parenthood with the uncertainty and challenges of life on the road; of coming to terms with the limitations of the \"folk\" tag that launched their career and pushing past it into uncharted musical territory; of reimagining their entire approach in the studio to capture the magic and the bliss of their live show. In typical David Wax Museum fashion, the songs on \"Guesthouse\" are simplistic and sophisticated, elegant and plainspoken all at once. Rather than succumbing to the weight of the newfound responsibilities that landed on their doorstep, the band has leaned into the challenges to capture a brilliant portrait of the messy beauty of it all.\n\nThe roots of David Wax Museum stretch back nearly a decade, and all the way from New England to Mexico. As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as \"pure, irresistible joy.\" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding \"like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent\") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music \"global crossover at its best\"). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, and more.\n\nIt was on the road over these past few years as the band and audiences grew, though, that Wax could feel their exuberant live show evolving beyond its formative roots.\n\n\"I felt empowered to start the band because of my time in Mexico studying folk music,\" Wax explains. \"In Boston, the term 'Americana' or 'folk' was just this catchall to describe what everyone was doing. It was helpful to use that to talk about our music at first, but we've found that our hearts feel most shaken, and the band fires on all cylinders, when we're putting on a rock show. What we've tried to retain about our folk origins is the warm sound of people playing acoustic instruments together in a room. But, by embracing more of an indie rock approach, we've colored this record with synthesizers, layers of percussion, and adventurous sonic processing. The mental shift of it helped us feel like we could do anything we wanted. There were no rules that we had to follow in terms of what was 'authentic.'\"\n\nPart of the inspiration for the shift was the presence of guitarist and producer Josh Kaufman, who sat in with the band on tour and added new sounds and textures that the they'd never experimented with before. When it came time to record \"Guesthouse,\" the band knew he had to helm it in the studio.\n\n\"The songs entered this Technicolor, 3D world with Josh,\" explains Wax. \"Aside from his contributions to the arrangements, he really wanted us all to be in a room playing the music together live so that the groove would be central. We brought in two other drummers, and there was a real focus on having as much percussion happening at the same time as possible. We gravitate towards that naturally because of the Mexican influences, all of the syncopations and 6/8 dance rhythms and the energy that that gives us, but we really embraced it this time around.\"\n\nThat emphasis on groove sucks you in from the opening seconds of the kickoff track, \"Every Time Katie,\" a whispered come-on that roils and pulses like an anxious heartbeat and features gorgeous call and response vocals from David and Suz. It's followed by \"Dark Night Of The Heart,\" which pushes the sonic envelope further than any previous David Wax Museum track, blending chamber strings, psychedelic vocal filters, explosive drums, and swirling synthesizers.\n\nWritten partially in Mexico and partially in western Massachusetts, the lyrics on \"Guesthouse\" find Wax writing with more direct, personal honesty than ever before.\n\n\"I had felt really reluctant to talk about personal stuff in the past,\" says Wax. \"I was writing personally, but there were lots of things I was obfuscating or filtering through a character to protect myself from putting too much out there. But it got to a point where it was taking a lot more energy than it was worth to maintain that privacy. When we had our daughter, Calliope, it felt like this sudden release because talking and singing about our lives was becoming more and more integral to what we were doing as artists and who we were as people.\"\n\nThe title track, which draws on several traditional Mexican songs for musical inspiration, is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the life of a traveling musician hunting for a free place to crash, while \"Lose Touch With The World\" faces down the reality of living a life far removed from that of your friends and family, and \"Young Man\" is an earnest musing on growing older.\n\n\"It's about being a parent and coming to terms with what your ambition is,\" explains Wax. \"What part of that is essential to who you are, and what part can you let go of? We have to check in with ourselves and ask what we're doing and why we're doing it more often now because we're not just us putting ourselves through the mental and physical sacrifices of touring anymore,\" he continues. \"Now Calliope is going through it with us, and Suz's dad and my cousin Jordan are going through it with us on the road. And because we're constantly checking and making sure we're doing this for the right reasons, that we feel honest in our hearts about it, I think that's brought new life to what we're doing and a new energy and a new level of commitment.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment brought beautifully to life on \"Everything Changes,\" as Wax and Slezak sing, \"Everything changes / when two becomes three.\" The song was written in response to all of the good-natured warnings about what having a child would mean for the couple, the freedom and sleep and sanity they might lose out on. Instead, they choose to focus on everything they've gained: a beautiful daughter, a stronger bond with their families and fans than ever before, and without a doubt, the most exciting album of their career. For David Wax Museum, the stakes may be higher, but that just means the rewards are even bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ron Jackson LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388891.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Swing, Instrumental, Soul, Jazz Instrument, R&b, Electric Jazz, Worldbeat, Blues, Zydeco, Acoustic, Reggae, Calypso, New Age, Jazz-funk, Blues-rock, Guitar Jazz, Soul Jazz, Jazz, Funk, Guitar Virtuoso", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Versatile and sophisticated jazz guitarist Ron Jackson has performed, recorded and taught music in over 30 countries.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Miles To Nowhere ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368475.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Tempe, Arizona", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Miles to Nowhere live on Carter Drive Sessions\nwith special guests Leigh Dekay and Chris Daley of Krovak\n\nBrought to you by Carter Drive Sessions and Underdog Studios."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "D-Soul Davis Experience ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9853066.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Waco, Texas", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from Waco, Texas, Demetrius Davis started his musical career at 8 years old when he took to the stage singing in a school play.

His first step into the national spotlight came in 1991 when he became a founding member of the Aquarium Rescue Unit featuring Col. Bruce Hampton, a cult classic that has stood the test of time. That led to his membership in the classic rock group The Allman Brothers Band. Since 1997, his work with the band has earned him two Grammy nominations for best rock instrumental, in 2003 and in 2004. Over the years, Oteil has shared the stage with rock and blues legends such as Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, Levon Helm, Taj Mahal, Buddy Guy, Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin, Billy Gibbons, Chuck Leavell, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Johnny Winter, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow and Trey Anastasio. In 2012, Oteil received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for his 17 year contribution to the Allman Brothers Band as the longest running bassist in the band\u2019s history.\n\nWhile touring and recording with the Allman Brothers over the years, Oteil still found time to collaborate with many other musicians. He formed his solo group, Oteil and the Peacemakers in 1998. From 1998 until 2007, the group toured extensively and released three albums. In 2001, Oteil joined Phish\u2019s keyboardist Page McConnell and The Funky Meters\u2019 drummer Russell Batiste to form Vida Blue. He also founded an improv based trio with Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann and Max Creek guitarist Scott Murawski in 2008.\n\nOteil reunited on stage with his brother Kofi after ten years of touring separately when Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi formed the Tedeschi Trucks Band in late 2010, featuring the Burbridge brothers in the rhythm section. The 11-piece super group released their first record, Revelator, in 2011 which won a Grammy in February 2012. The Tedeschi Trucks Band played Eric Clapton\u2019s iconic Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2011. Oteil\u2019s original composition \u201cLove Has Something Else to Say\u201d was including in the DVD release and on their Grammy-winning debut album.

The band toured the US in the fall of 2015 and the summer of 2016 and 2017.

Their sound, an epic and cinematic dark-pop, is fused with a wide variety of influences including alternative, indie-rock, K-pop, and J-pop.\n\n\nWhile many assume that the sisters have been playing music together since birth, Crimson Apple formed the summer of 2012. The girls have always viewed the formation of the band as an act of fate; Each sister picked up their respective instruments and found their love of music at different stages in their lives. One day, they realized that together, they made up the perfect pieces of a whole band.\n\n\nAfter performing in numerous venues in their beautiful home of Hawaii, the sisters decided to relocate to Los Angeles in 2015 to further pursue their music careers. Within a year of the move, they became regular performers for Disneyland and shortly after signed recording- and management deals with Amuse Group USA, Inc.\n\n\nCrimson Apple has since been making music and touring multiple festivals and venues across America, opening for major acts such as The Chainsmokers, The Plain White T's, and All Time Low. Their passion can be felt in their hard-hitting live performances and their debut EP, \"Somebody\", where the band has worked devotedly to create a strong, cohesive image and sound that reflects their bond as sisters.\n\n\nWith the release of \"Break Your Heart Worse\" on May 22, Crimson Apple uses a dark, twisted love story to introduce the next phase of their evolution as a band.\n\n\nCRIMSON APPLE is:\n\n\nColby Benson - Lead Vocals\nShelby Benson - Guitar / Vocals\nCarthi Benson - Bass / Vocals\nFaith Benson - Drums / Vocals", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The David Wax Museum LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8227319.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Mexican Folk, Folk, Mexo-americana, Americana, Latin Folk, Indie Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Suz and I started this band as friends,\" says David Wax, \"but now we\u2019re married and have a child and have our family on the road with us. The stakes are different.\"\n\nThose stakes are what lie at the heart of David Wax Museum's fourth and boldest studio album to date, \"Guesthouse.\" It's the sound of a band reconciling the accountability of marriage and parenthood with the uncertainty and challenges of life on the road; of coming to terms with the limitations of the \"folk\" tag that launched their career and pushing past it into uncharted musical territory; of reimagining their entire approach in the studio to capture the magic and the bliss of their live show. In typical David Wax Museum fashion, the songs on \"Guesthouse\" are simplistic and sophisticated, elegant and plainspoken all at once. Rather than succumbing to the weight of the newfound responsibilities that landed on their doorstep, the band has leaned into the challenges to capture a brilliant portrait of the messy beauty of it all.\n\nThe roots of David Wax Museum stretch back nearly a decade, and all the way from New England to Mexico. As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as \"pure, irresistible joy.\" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding \"like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent\") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music \"global crossover at its best\"). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, and more.\n\nIt was on the road over these past few years as the band and audiences grew, though, that Wax could feel their exuberant live show evolving beyond its formative roots.\n\n\"I felt empowered to start the band because of my time in Mexico studying folk music,\" Wax explains. \"In Boston, the term 'Americana' or 'folk' was just this catchall to describe what everyone was doing. It was helpful to use that to talk about our music at first, but we've found that our hearts feel most shaken, and the band fires on all cylinders, when we're putting on a rock show. What we've tried to retain about our folk origins is the warm sound of people playing acoustic instruments together in a room. But, by embracing more of an indie rock approach, we've colored this record with synthesizers, layers of percussion, and adventurous sonic processing. The mental shift of it helped us feel like we could do anything we wanted. There were no rules that we had to follow in terms of what was 'authentic.'\"\n\nPart of the inspiration for the shift was the presence of guitarist and producer Josh Kaufman, who sat in with the band on tour and added new sounds and textures that the they'd never experimented with before. When it came time to record \"Guesthouse,\" the band knew he had to helm it in the studio.\n\n\"The songs entered this Technicolor, 3D world with Josh,\" explains Wax. \"Aside from his contributions to the arrangements, he really wanted us all to be in a room playing the music together live so that the groove would be central. We brought in two other drummers, and there was a real focus on having as much percussion happening at the same time as possible. We gravitate towards that naturally because of the Mexican influences, all of the syncopations and 6/8 dance rhythms and the energy that that gives us, but we really embraced it this time around.\"\n\nThat emphasis on groove sucks you in from the opening seconds of the kickoff track, \"Every Time Katie,\" a whispered come-on that roils and pulses like an anxious heartbeat and features gorgeous call and response vocals from David and Suz. It's followed by \"Dark Night Of The Heart,\" which pushes the sonic envelope further than any previous David Wax Museum track, blending chamber strings, psychedelic vocal filters, explosive drums, and swirling synthesizers.\n\nWritten partially in Mexico and partially in western Massachusetts, the lyrics on \"Guesthouse\" find Wax writing with more direct, personal honesty than ever before.\n\n\"I had felt really reluctant to talk about personal stuff in the past,\" says Wax. \"I was writing personally, but there were lots of things I was obfuscating or filtering through a character to protect myself from putting too much out there. But it got to a point where it was taking a lot more energy than it was worth to maintain that privacy. When we had our daughter, Calliope, it felt like this sudden release because talking and singing about our lives was becoming more and more integral to what we were doing as artists and who we were as people.\"\n\nThe title track, which draws on several traditional Mexican songs for musical inspiration, is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the life of a traveling musician hunting for a free place to crash, while \"Lose Touch With The World\" faces down the reality of living a life far removed from that of your friends and family, and \"Young Man\" is an earnest musing on growing older.\n\n\"It's about being a parent and coming to terms with what your ambition is,\" explains Wax. \"What part of that is essential to who you are, and what part can you let go of? We have to check in with ourselves and ask what we're doing and why we're doing it more often now because we're not just us putting ourselves through the mental and physical sacrifices of touring anymore,\" he continues. \"Now Calliope is going through it with us, and Suz's dad and my cousin Jordan are going through it with us on the road. And because we're constantly checking and making sure we're doing this for the right reasons, that we feel honest in our hearts about it, I think that's brought new life to what we're doing and a new energy and a new level of commitment.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment brought beautifully to life on \"Everything Changes,\" as Wax and Slezak sing, \"Everything changes / when two becomes three.\" The song was written in response to all of the good-natured warnings about what having a child would mean for the couple, the freedom and sleep and sanity they might lose out on. Instead, they choose to focus on everything they've gained: a beautiful daughter, a stronger bond with their families and fans than ever before, and without a doubt, the most exciting album of their career. For David Wax Museum, the stakes may be higher, but that just means the rewards are even bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Raskins LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10381034.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Retro-rock N Roll", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Throughout rock history, we have seen several brother tandems that have left a deep impression - Don and Phil Everly, Angus and Malcolm Young, Eddie and Alex Van Halen, etc. And soon, rock fans will be introduced to the next brother-led rock band that is sure to break through in a big way - the Raskins. Formed several years ago by twins Roger and Logan Raskin, the union originally began as a mere writing project for producer Greg Ladany. But after several demos were cut and the brothers realized they were on to something, it became a permanent proposition, and the Raskins were born.\n\nAnd while seemingly the majority of today's chart toppers are sonically one-dimensional, the Raskins are a throwback to the days of when bands weren't as confined stylistically. Case in point, the bros list such wide-ranging artists as Kiss, the Buzzcocks, Jim Croce, the Temptations, Mel Torme, and Jane's Addiction as influences. As a result, the \"rock/retro/alternative/pop-rock/singer-songwriter\" tag that the Raskins like to go by is indeed well fitting.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, and fans will be able to experience the Raskins on a pair of nearby speakers soon, as the duo's self-titled debut album was just released, while the leadoff single, \"We Had It All,\" dropped during their Spring tour with Scot Weiland. Songs such as \"We Had It All,\" \"Need Another Hero,\" and \"The Radio Song\" show the retro rock side of the band, while songs like \"Open Our Eyes,\" \"Reach,\" and \"Where Do We Go From Here\" show the diversity of the band's songwriting with acoustic type pop rock ballads.\n\n\"The first radio single and video we decided to go with was 'We Had It All',\" explains Roger. \"This song definitely shows a sound of the band which is most consistent with our biggest rock influences as well as the song being written with a specific topic in mind.\" And according to Logan, a follow-up single has already been selected. \"The second single will be 'The Radio Song,' which is a simple story written about a group of guys grinding with their band on the road - this being us - then all of a sudden, they hear their song on the radio for the first time and how that suddenly changes everything for them, mostly emotionally. We always wanted to write a song about that - most musicians can relate as well as most fans understanding that crucial emotion every musician yearns for.\"\n\nAs for the Raskins' plans once the album is released, it is a simple one, according to Roger. \"Clearly the future plans for the Raskins is to tour as much as possible, and bring our music to every city in the US, as well as all the local radio stations, doing promotional giveaways, rock shows, and signings for all our fans. We want to show the public that we our very accessible. Also eventually heading over to Europe to give our expanded fan base the opportunity to experience the Raskins live. The Europeans love them some rock n roll. Can't wait to share our music with all of them!\"\n\nLastly, Logan unveils that both the music and the bond of brotherhood will prevail for the Raskins. \"We work and strive extremely hard for success with our music. Through all the ups and downs, the trials and tribulations, the acceptances and denials. We always have each other. That is the main focus of the Raskins. We are doing music because we love it and it's our passion. For us we feel we have already had major success because we are doing what we love most in the world to do - write and perform our music for the world to see.\"Thus helping set the standard for the Raskins and continuing on this wonderful musical journey and allowing the world to enjoy all our music.\nWe love you all\n\nFor further information go to www.TheRaskins.com", "otherInfo": "Join The Raskins live online Sunday May24th 6pm PT 9pm ET for their long awaited acoustic performance.

His grandparents played a variety of instruments; his mother played piano; and his father taught music and was a choir director. In addition to possessing a natural ability to sing, Aweau\u2019s early years consisted of piano, guitar, and \u2018ukulele lessons, followed by saxophone, percussion, and bass.\n\nHe began his professional career in college, accompanying such well-known performers as Gabe Baltazar, Henry Kapono, Loyal Garner, and Nohelani Cypriano, followed by stints as a member of the award-winning groups Ka`eo (1984-1988), The Ali\u2019i\u2019s (1989-1994), and Hapa (2003-2010). He was also the musical director for the legendary Don Ho for 16 years, and has worked with national artists such as Jerry Brown (drummer for Lionel Richie and Stanley Clarke), and Ron Lee (drummer for Barry Manilow).\n\nAweau also taught music at high school and college seminars, covering subjects ranging from writing, arranging, and sequencing to computer music. In one project he gave Hawai\u2019i high school students the chance to experience the process of producing and recording a song.\n\nIn addition to being a stage musician, Aweau has played for a variety of commercials and provided background music for a number of shows on the Travel Channel. A seasoned music producer, he has worked extensively in the studio producing, arranging, and performing for various large projects, commercials, radio stations, and other artists.\n\nBeloved by fans, Aweau is a natural storyteller with a somewhat self-deprecating sense of humor. His audiences love his explanations of the inspiration behind his songs. He is also highly respected by fellow musicians. The late John Koko, long-time member of the highly popular, multiple-award winning Hawaiian music group The Makaha Sons, once said, \u201cNathan Aweau ... Incredible Bass Player \u2026 Irresistible Voice... Incomparable Entertainer! The CD \u2018Kane`ohe\u2019 will take you on a musical journey that is Haunting...Refreshing... Powerful and Exciting.\u201d\n\nThe respect of other professionals in the music industry is also evidenced by the fact that Aweau has received numerous nominations and awards for his work, both as a solo artist and as part of a group. His 2001 release E Apo Mai received multiple N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards (Hawaii\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae), including Male Vocalist of the Year and Hawaiian Album of the Year. He also received Song of the Year honors at the Hawai\u2019i Music Awards for the album\u2019s title track.\n\n2005 saw Aweau again honored with multiple awards, as both a solo artist and as part of the group Hapa. His passion for the electric bass was expressed in his Bass Etude CD, which was voted Jazz Album of the Year. And Hapa\u2019s Maui CD, which shot up Billboard\u2019s World Music chart (peaking at number 7), received awards for Album of the Year, Contemporary Album of the Year, Graphics, and Engineering. Aweau was also honored with his second award for Male Vocalist of the Year for his album The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series - Vintage.\n\nIn 2006 Aweau received his third Male Vocalist of the Year award, for his The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series \u2013 Hula CD. In the 39 year history of the N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards, he remains the only artist to receive the honor three times.\n\nIn 2008 Aweau released \u201cKane\u2019ohe\u201d - the long-awaited follow up to \u201cE Apo Mai\u201d \u2013 which was comprised of songs that celebrate the place that he calls home. He wrote all twelve songs, played every instrument, sang all the background parts, and engineered, mixed, and mastered the entire CD.\n\nHis December 2015 release \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is yet another all-original album, filled with songs inspired by his beloved Hawai\u2019i, his first grandchild, Queen Lili\u2019uokalani, and more. As was the case for his other solo releases, \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is 100% Aweau.

Pop it in. Rewind. Press play.\nA whiskey-voiced narrator starts speaking as the hazy images come into focus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 2010. Zeds Dead is about to play one of their first shows in the basement of a dive bar in Toronto. Behind the brick walls and the unfinished ceiling exposed wires hang freely. The air smells of booze, smoke, and sweat. A crowd is lined up outside, flasks hang from their back pockets and cigarettes from their lips. Abandoned drinks rest on the lip of the dj booth while joints get sparked in the corners.\n\nThe tiny room is packed. Nobody quite knows how to describe the music yet. When Hooks and DC start their set the earth trembles. The air becomes charged and almost sexual. Everyone goes crazy. You feel the music in your bones. Your marrow shakes. You don\u2019t know what they will play next but you know it might just change your life. Everybody at those early shows could tell - these guys are gonna be big.\"\n\nFast forward a few scenes. The narrator continues.\n\n\"It\u2019s 2013. Zeds Dead is killing it. They\u2019ve got an enormous catalogue that includes remixes for some of the biggest artists out there, and releases with the most credible labels in the game. They've accumulated hundreds of millions of views online. They play tours of over 70 dates to hundreds of thousands of people.

The place is Toronto, Canada. Teenagers Zack Rapp-Rovan and Dylan Mamid are introduced - they hit it off immediately over a shared love of classic hip hop, music production, and digging through crates. They join forces and call themselves Mass Productions aka MP Records. Dylan becomes DC and Zack becomes Hooks. They work out of DC\u2019s often smoky garage. Critiquing, dissecting and swapping samples. They grow with every tune. They get on a level where their combined sound is unified and strong. MP releases an LP of hip hop instrumentals called Fresh Beets. It\u2019s a pivotal moment for the duo.\"\n\nFast forward a couple chapters.\n\n\"It\u2019s 2009 and hip hop is in a coma. Hooks and DC are about to have an epiphany that will change everything. They thirst for something new. They want to make people move to their sounds and not just bob their heads, but to grind, heave, shiver, stomp, and dance to their music. They want to capture the ecstasy and comradery of house, the heart pummelling thrill of Drum and Bass, the beauty of ambient music, and the heaviness of electro - all in one sound. They want to push boundaries. To challenge themselves and their listeners to\u201d--\n\nThe movie cuts out. Ribbons of static shimmer across the blackness. Someone has taped over this part.

From the roots of acoustic music to amped up rock n\u2019 roll and into the electronic revolution, the options available to the modern musician are more like a scientific lab, then the campfire jam from where it all started. From the controls of a tiny laptop, a performer now has the power to mix, change and loop sounds in a concert setting with great ease. This modern twist of technology is bringing a new level of music to the electronic dance party.\n\nWhile the genre of live electronica is relatively new on the music circuit, nobody is breaking the boundaries of live producing and improvisation like EOTO. Fusing elements of live instrumentation, house music, dubstep and electro into their dance ready sound, the band will be taking the country by storm beginning in late September for their perennial fall tour, performing 33 consecutive nights in a row.\n\nConsisting of Michael Travis and Jason Hann the duo mixes the organic sounds of live drums, bass and guitar through a variety of programs and gadgets to create a style of music that is more likely found in a dance club, then a live music theater. What sets EOTO apart from other artists in this emerging genre is how the music is created. While some artists may spend hours pre-mixing samples and elements of music for their live show, EOTO uses nothing pre-recorded, giving them the ability to approach each song with on-the-spot spontaneity and 100% live improvisation.\n\nBecause of the ever-changing sound and style of music, it\u2019s hard to describe a band like EOTO. In a recent discussion on the bands highly active Facebook page, the thousands of subscribed fans were asked to describe the band in their own words \u2013 descriptions ranged from mythical to visual, each in awe of the duo\u2019s ability to create high octane dance music in a live setting. A trait that has fans old and new catching multiple shows on a tour and packing venues wherever they play. Or maybe EOTO is selling out venues around the coast for the spirit of dance music they bring in general.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the members of EOTO have performed with a range of musicians second to none. Their combined resume includes the likes of Isaac Hayes, Loreena McKinnett, Herbie Hancock, Drummers of STOMP, DJ Tequila, Les Nubians, Stanley Jordan, Les ClayPool, Joshua Redman, Arturo Sandoval, Bela Fleck, Trilok Gurtu, Charlie Hunter, Mike Marshall and Dave Grisman just to name a few.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/lfot-summer-camp-weekend-pass"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mr. Carmack ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7263287.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Electronic, Trap", "Time": "4:40 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "French horn, piano, drums, percussion, trumpet, bass, ukulele, guitar, melodica.

Thompson\u2019s massive body of work includes over 40 albums, many Grammy nominations, as well as numerous soundtracks, including Werner Herzog\u2019s Grizzly Man. His most recent CD, Electric, was produced by the great Nashville musician Buddy Miller (Band of Joy, Patty Griffin.). Electric continues to receive positive praise with Rolling Stone declaring, \u201c\u2026the excellence is undeniable.\u201d This year saw Richard Thompson headlining dates around the world as well as co-headlining shows with Emmylou Harris & Rodney Crowell.

The new single, entitled 'Tickle Me Pink' proceeds the release on 19th May.\n\n2007 was a hell of a year for Johnny Flynn having released a bunch of critically acclaimed singles (both on Young & Lost and his new home Vertigo), wowing crowds from Buffalo Bar to Bestival, from the End Of The Road festival to the Royal Albert Hall and recording his debut album in the Autumn made for a busy year. But if 2007 was the year when word began to spread about this prodigiously talented 24 year old, then 2008 is the year that those whispers become a chorus. Further evidence of this is Johnny's recent sighing to US label Lost Highway, home of Johnny Cash, Ryan Adams and Van Morrison to name a few. He is the first UK artist to sign to this prestigious label.\n\nJohnny Flynn's music is brimming over with heart, soul and intelligence. Drawing on diverse influences - The Pixies, Vaughn Williams and anti-folk pioneer Dianne Cluck are all name checked on his Myspace page - Johnny draws on a century's worth of folk, blues and country to create a sound that dwells profoundly in the now. Acknowledging his debt to these musical traditions but never being overwhelmed by them, Johnny Flynn offers an alternative of substance to those who have grown sick of flimsy singer songwriters and their inane observations.\n\nHe spent much of the autumn deep in the Seattle countryside recording his debut album with producer Ryan Hadlock (The Gossip, The Strokes, Regina Spektor) at his secluded Bear Creek studio. Here they managed to capture the raw energy of Johnny Flynn's shows, underpinning the acoustic guitar, cello and ukulele with muscular drums and bass.\n\nLive Johnny Flynn are a sight to behold - think Nick Drake fronting The Pogues at the Underage Festival and you're nearly there. After a Summer of rapturously received festival performances, and Autumn tours with Jack Penate and Iron & Wine, Johnny and band headed out on their first headline tour of the UK in February, swiftly followed by a stint supporting Laura Marling on her UK tour, which finished early March.

But if 2007 was the year when word began to spread about this prodigiously talented 24 year old, then 2008 is the year that those whispers become a chorus.

Drawing on diverse influences - The Pixies, Vaughn Williams and anti-folk pioneer Dianne Cluck are all name checked on his Myspace page - Johnny draws on a century's worth of folk, blues and country to create a sound that dwells profoundly in the now. Acknowledging his debt to these musical traditions but never being overwhelmed by them, Johnny Flynn offers an alternative of substance to those who have grown sick of flimsy singer songwriters and their inane observations.\n\nHe spent much of the autumn deep in the Seattle countryside recording his debut album with producer Ryan Hadlock (The Gossip, The Strokes, Regina Spektor) at his secluded Bear Creek studio.

The \"Stealing Moves\" 12\" followed in 2002. That same year, Dear signed a deal with legendary Canadian techno producer Richie Hawtin's influential Plus 8 label, where he released three 12\" singles as False. In 2003, he released the \"Girlfriend\" 12\" on Berlin's Perlon as Jabberjaw. Two more releases on Spectral Sound under his own name followed later that year, \"EP1\" and \"EP2.\" In late 2003, he issued his debut full-length on Spectral, \"Leave Luck To Heaven,\" to wide acclaim. The \"Backstroke\" EP followed in 2004. Dear's 2007 full-length, \"Asa Breed,\" found him working with a more song-based and pop-inclined sound.\n\nDear has also released several works through Spectral as his dirty-minded hard-techno alter ego, Audion. The \"Kisses\" EP was his first release under the Audion moniker in 2004; two more EPs, 2004's \"The Pong\" and 2005's \"Just Fucking\" followed.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

As the son of Irish singing sensation Dominic Kirwan, it comes as no surprise that Barry had showbiz aspirations from a very early age. Growing up, Barry was a committed member of his school\u2019s choir and devoted much of his time performing in school productions or competing in various solo singing feis\u2019. At the age of 5 he joined the Seamus Kerrigan School of Traditional Irish Dance where he stayed until the age of 18. Here Barry had the amazing opportunity to travel throughout Ireland taking part in a range of competitions, such as the All Ireland Dancing championships and Sc\u00f3r to name a few. A triple threat, Barry can also add acting to his ever increasing list of talents after the years he spent as a member of the Hazel Wand drama school in his hometown of Omagh. No stranger to the stage, Barry was destined to return and seize the spotlight later on in life. At age 11, Barry fell in love with drumming and excelled from grade 1-8 within the space of five years. His passion for the instrument led him to further study in London at Drumtech college, part of the British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) schools. Shortly after college Barry decided to join his father\u2019s band as his drummer and provided backing vocals for over 4 years. Constantly growing as a musician, Barry left Dominic\u2019s band in September 2010 and had the opportunity to live with his brother Colm in Nashville. During his time in the US he stayed with close friends, American country duo Joey & Rory where he had the incredible honour to play drums for 4 of their US shows. As January 2011 came to a close Barry had began to work with Ireland\u2019s princess of country, Lisa McHugh and performed with her until September 2011 before becoming the drummer and backing vocalist for the hit recording artist Derek Ryan. During his 4 and a half years working with the Derek Ryan band, Barry toured all around Ireland, the U.K and Australia. With every show in every city, Barry\u2019s desires became more apparent and in February 2016 he left the Derek Ryan band to pursue his own dream of a solo career in the Irish country music scene. For the past 4 months he has been touring with his father as the support act on the \u2018Here For A Good Time\u2019 tour throughout the UK and Ireland which has proven to be an excellent platform to prepare before his own live shows this summer. On 6th May 2016, Barry released his first solo single \u2018\u2018Keep It In The Middle Of The Road\u2019 from his debut studio album. The song shot to No. 1 spot on the Irish iTunes Country chart and No.2 in the UK iTunes Country chart - a foretelling of the successful career this rising star will undoubtedly have in the years ahead.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Deejay Commish ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388827.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Dancehall, Soca, Dance Edm, Reggae", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The artistry of being a DJ is a rare gift.

My granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy was born in Caswell County in 1795. Maybe we go back further, I don't know.\n\nOn Friday the 13th, November 1970, I was born at the Cape Fear Valley Hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, probably the biggest military town in the country. Fort Bragg alone covers 250 square miles, and the used car dealerships and titty bars are like stars in the sky, grains of sand on the beach. The ground is sandy and the woods are open and piney, with tall loblollies, jack oaks, and the longleaf pine.\n\nWe left for Fort Worth, Texas when I was about 2 or 3, so that dad could attend Southwest Theological Seminary. My first memory is of crossing the Mississppi in a U-Haul. My dad was excited about the bridge and couldn't stop talking about how it was an engineering marvel and all.\n\nFrom there, the memories get thicker, catching tarantulas after a rainstorm, putting pennies on the railroad track, barefoot ooching across the Texas road, so hot the asphalt was soft. There was a snowstorm. We've got pictures.\n\nDad got a commision to preach in an English-speaking church in what was then West Germany, in a little town called Vernheim. Our landlord worked for Mercedes, got a new one every year, and kept a weinkellar like a liquor store. Dad would give me the rent check, I'd walk it upstairs, and the hausfrau would pinch my cheeks and give me a chocolate bar as big as my head.\n\nIn church, my father preached and my mother played piano for the services. I learned how to sing in that church and even did a solo of \"Amazing Grace\" for the congregation. We had a piano in the house and my mom gave me some lessons. I did really well, but I got bored with the workbook/lesson plan style. My brother had a guitar and that was cooler. We moved to Giessen a few years later and he got \"The Wall\" for a birthday present from a friend. Mom and Dad almost didn't let him keep it, 'cause there were \"disturbing images\" on the inside. They relented and Gray taught me my first guitar piece, that cool acoustic guitar solo in A minor. I was 8.\n\nWhen I was about ten, we came back to the states, my daddy lost his mind, divorced my mom, and started drinking and managing Eckerds drug stores. He went through another wife and found the construction industry, wherein he could stay drunk all day. That finally lead him to recovery and he spent the rest of his life building houses for storm victims and Habitat whenever he could. He was a good man with a lot of demons, and he married a third time 'til death did he part in 1999. His favorite song was \"Amazing Grace\" and his vinyl bluegrass collection influenced me greatly, especially Flatt and Scruggs and the Stanley Brothers. He bought a banjo once and became so frustrated with it that he turned it into a clock.\n\nMom was a rock through all of that, got a good job at UNC, paid a man to build her a log cabin in the country outside of Chapel Hill, and did her best to raise me. I was a real pain in the ass. Once I got my own guitar, I had a place to put all my teen angst, but it didn't help my schoolwork at all. I probably set records for non-attendance and spent a lot of time running around in the deep woods of western Orange County. Four years in the high school jazz big band program taught me the majority of what I still know about music theory. Along with an early enlistment in the Navy, music got me through and out into the real world, where I finally got my ass kicked.\n\nI spent the next four years touring the Mediterranean on a tank landing ship out of Little Creek Naval Base in Norfolk, VA. The open ocean is a powerful thing to behold. The stars at night are unlike anything you will see on this Earth anymore; it is the last great wilderness. Besides that, being tear-gassed was about the most fun I ever had in the Navy. I carried a guitar behind my bunk everywhere we went and made strange four-track recordings when we were in port and there was an empty berthing to use as a late-night studio. Of all the guys I knew on ship, I still remember the names of the ones I played music with- Robert Thomas, David Saylor, Hadji Henderson.\n\nAfter my time was up, I spent some days in Virgina Beach, playing in a heavy rock band called Coup d'Etat at first, and then Day 11, which was just a license plate we saw at a grocery store one day. We were sort of prog, like Bad Brains meets King Crimson and we rubbed Tiger Balm on our nads before we took the stage because Fishbone said that they did. They probably said that just to see if anyone would do it. A girlfriend gave me my first acoustic guitar, a Fender; I think she stole it. She stole enough money from me that I think I paid her for it.\n\nVirginia Beach outright sucked, so I came home to work at Weaver Street Market and started another band called Scalliwag. I knew there was something missing from my culinary life (mac'n'cheese, ramen, pizza) and the job at Weaver Street was a cry for help. It turned out to be the social hub of Carrboro, NC and I met a lot of people who are still my close friends today. The rock band thing wasn't working out, so I started playing the acoustic more and met a lot of other acoustic musicians.\n\nMy friends Leo Lorenzoni and Michael Kovich told me about an Old-time fiddler's convention up in Buena Vista, VA and it sounded like just a laid-back, weekend-long party. I cruised up there and hung out with them; I can't even remember if I had a tent. It changed my life and it changed my music, just banging away on an A chord for hours at a time and sippin' that corn liquor. I didn't know the songs and I didn't care. Whatever these people had a hold of, I wanted some of it. It shot straight down into my veins like lightning and made my hair stand up on end. The music was intense, lyrically cut down to the bone, no bullshit. They didn't have bridges; bridges were for pussies. People got killed, died or fell in love and then got killed or maybe drank themselves to death. They weren't gonna be treated this way and they'd trade their shoes for a little bottle of booze. They were big, like John Henry and Wild Bill Jones, all fists and whiskey, heartbroken and angry as I was, ready to kill somebody.\n\nI started going to Clifftop and Mt. Airy and finding Old-time jams at home and on the road, anywhere my new friends lived. I got to thinking that I could write songs like that, or maybe one just fell out of me and I thought, \"Wow, there it is.\" Either way, I figured nobody was writing songs like that anymore, at least nobody I'd heard, and I knew that style was just technique. In other words, those songs didn't sound old because they were old; they sounded old because they were written in an old style. There wasn't a reason in the world why somebody couldn't write a song like that, if he wanted to.\n\n\"Ashe County Fair\" was probably the first song I wrote like that. Another one was \"Velma,\" a song I wrote about the woman who killed my grandfather. I think somebody dies in most of the songs on my first album. Three of them die in \"Velma.\" I was also playing Irish music by the time I recorded, so I played the guitar parts in an alternate tuning, DADGAD. In retrospect, it gives the whole album a dark, open sound that takes the themes over the edge and out into the dripping woods.\n\nI started touring full-time in 2000, realizing that I could do it as a solo performer and actually make a living. Of course, that's what every other singer/songwriter in America was doing, too, but I didn't even know what a singer/songwriter was, so that didn't bother me. I thought I was a folk musician. Over time, I realized that folk got cross-dressed and don't mean what it used to mean anymore. I think my friend Aengus Finnan said it better than anybody I've heard yet, \"It's a style of presentation.\" So that's just it, as long as you don't put on the razzle-dazzle and shake your ass in a sequin skirt, you can be a folk musician. Sit there on a stool and play your tuba, tell a story once in a while and wear some Birckenstocks. Everybody will think you're a folk musician.\n\nIn 2002, I went to the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas, where there are lots of these folk musicians, only mostly songwriters. I wandered around for a week looking for the dance tent and the fiddle bands before I realized what I've already said about the word \"folk.\" It ended up being an amazing and inspiring experience and I've been for all 18 days every year since. At the 2003 festival, I won the New Folk competition and got hired on as a performer for the next three years. I never took to Birckenstocks and my friend Anais Mitchell helped me find a great pair of boots in Austin. They're Fryes.\n\nIn 2004, Dromedary and I recorded an album together called \"The Sea and the Sky,\" which brings beautiful instruments from all over the world into my sound and songwriting. I've toured in Europe and the US with them, including a return to Kerrville and two consecutive years at the Moab Folk Festival in gorgeous Moab, Utah. If you're not familiar with Dromedary, I highly recommend you go to dromedarymusic.com right now- well, after you read the rest of this, anyway. Their music is magic, like the voice of Emmylou Harris, an instant drop in the shoulders, a glaze on the eyes, a trip back to childhood. I'm honored to be friends with them and occasionally share the three-man funk in a rental car.\n\nThe next album was a rock 'n' roll album called \"This Is The New That.\" Rock 'n' roll, because I just didn't know how else to play these songs. They're rock 'n' roll songs. It leads off with a revision of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" Dromedary came back into the studio with me and played electric guitars. Rock 'n' Roll Hall-of-Famer and Muscle Shoals session guitarist Will McFarlane sits in on a few. It was amazing to watch him work, a blue-eyed gent in a kilt ripping the blues from stem to stern. When the first take was done, there were no questions and nothing left to be done but get the cat off the ceiling. What a pro.\n\nWill McFarlane told me a story about recording with Frank Sinatra, wherein Frank walked in and sang the whole album, no retakes. The engineer asked him to sing the first few words of the first song again, because he hadn't had time for a line check. Apparently, Ol' Blue Eyes squared his shoulders and told the engineer, \"Overdubbing's for faggots,\" and walked out. Political incorrectness aside, I rather like his style.\n\nTexas is a huge influence on my writing. \"The Law and the Lonesome\" is what might have happened if Townes Van Zandt had made a record with Doc Watson. Tamara Kater of Canada's venerable folk mag Penguin Eggs called \"The Law and the Lonesome\" her \"album of the decade.\" Co-produced by the brilliant Chris Bartos in Toronto, \"The Law and the Lonesome\" features a couple of co-writes with my friend Corin Raymond. We wrote the title track together, which was featured in a songwriting class at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nI beat \"Radio Soul\" and recorded \"Cackalack\" in six hours with a handful of the best musicians in Toronto, although it sounds like it was recorded in a barn in North Carolina. Ken Whitely, who has gold and platinum records to his name, engineered the record in his converted garage with Nik Tjelios. As of mid-January 2011, \"Cackalack\" was #1 on Roots Music Reports folk radio chart. I went back to Canada and made a record in two days in Gimli, Manitoba with Alexa Dirks of Begonia and Andrina Turenne singing harmonies. Joanna Miller, Rej Ricard, and Grant Siemens round out the all-star Winnipeg crew.\n\nJonathan Byrd & The Pickup Cowboys is my latest record and project. We play every Wednesday at a little roadhouse called The Kraken on highway 54 outside Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The residency has become a community for some and a pilgrimage for others. Tune in on facebook live, 7-10pm Eastern Time any Wednesday, or make the trip to join us.

He is the son of folk singers Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle and the brother of Martha Wainwright, but Rufus has achieved his success by carving out his own singular sound in the worlds of rock, opera, theater, dance and film.\n\nRufus has released seven studio albums and three live albums to date, including his acclaimed GRAMMY\u00ae nominated Rufus Does Judy At Carnegie Hall! which captured his celebrated Judy Garland tribute performance at the London Palladium in 2007. Rufus has received Juno Awards for Best Alternative Album in 1999 and 2002 for Rufus Wainwright and Poses, respectively, and nominations for his albums Want Two (2005) and Release the Stars (2008). He was nominated for Songwriter of the Year in 2008 for his Release the Stars album.\n\nIn May 2012, Rufus released Out Of The Game, his most commercial work to date, a collaboration with mega-producer Mark Ronson. A labor of love for both Wainwright and Ronson, Rufus calls Out of the Game, \u201cthe most pop album I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d with Ronson stating: \u201cit\u2019s the best work of my career.\u201d The album debuted Top 25 in retail and has received widespread critical acclaim. Randall Roberts from the Los Angeles Times called Rufus\u2019 \u201cability to maneuver through complex emotions one of Wainwright\u2019s strengths\u201d and calls Out Of The Game \u201can essential recording.\u201d Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly calls the album \u201ca lush, soul-infused disc\u2026\u201d with People Magazine\u2019s Chuck Arnold proclaiming \u201cthe theatrical Wainwright scores an outright winner with more accessible fare.\u201d\n\nRufus has performed many notable shows with some of the world\u2019s best orchestras including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra playing original orchestrated pop songs and pieces from an extensive classical repertoire. Rufus composed Fire Shakespeare Sonnets for the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, which made its US debut in November 2010 and its UK premiere in March 2012 with the sixty-piece BBC Symphony Orchestra. He worked with the famed director Robert Wilson on a theatrical adaptation of the Sonnets at the Berliner Ensemble in 20090.\n\nWainwright\u2019s much acclaimed first opera, titled Prima Donna, premiered at the Manchester International Festival in July 2009. The opera made its London debut at Sadler\u2019s Wells in April 2010, and its North American debut in Toronto at the Luminato Festival in June 2010. Prima Donna made its long-awaited US debut in February 2012 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s Howard Gilman Opera House. Rufus has been commissioned by the Canadian Opera Company to write his second opera, based on the story of the Roman Emperor Hadrian and Antinous. The new opera will premiere in Toronto October 2018.\n\nMusically Rufus has collaborated with many artists including, most recently, Robbie Williams, co-writing and dueting on the title track of Robbie\u2019s Swing Both Ways album. Rufus has also worked with Elton John, Paul Simon, Antony Hegarty, David Byrne, Joni Mitchell, Guy Chambers and Boy George among others.\n\nVibrate: The Best of Rufus Wainwright will be released on March 3, 2014 on Universal records.

With his deep, beyond-his-years original lyrics and melodies, raw, soulful vocals, and powerful live performances, Sawyer seemed an unlikely match for reality tv, but having been scouted by casting directors at 15, he quickly won over broad audiences with his genuine delivery and unique arrangements of classic songs, going on to win season 8 of NBC's The Voice.\nFresh from that whirlwind, Fredericks went forward with the release of his major label debut, A Good Storm, with Republic Records, an impressive blend of soulful Folk, blues, and rock, entirely written or co-written by Sawyer. Choosing to go independent, for more creative freedom, his 2018 Hide Your Ghost, fully written and produced by Fredericks, sheds the high gloss major label treatment, and stays true to Fredericks\u2019s honest and elegantly stripped down style, a self-described \u201cfree range folk\u201d, incorporating elements of blues, roots rock, and jazz with live instrumental arrangements throughout. Considered one of the top ten Americana Albums of 2018, Chris Griffy, writing for No Depression and AXS magazine, calls Hide Your Ghost \u201ca bluesy folk rocker with a no-frills production that relies on Fredericks' raw voice to carry the emotional weight.\u201d\n2019 saw Sawyer and his band with official showcases at SXSW, AmericanaFest, Folk Alliance International, and BMI's Island Hopper Songwriter Fest. In November, Fredericks released the title track for his upcoming full length album, Flowers For You.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sarah Siskind ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10190389.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Rock, Americana, Fusion", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sarah Siskind built her music career in Nashville, TN and now lives in her home-state of North Carolina.

It was during those teenage years that he developed his love for classic songwriting \u2014 the kind that transcends generations and genres. He'd strum chords on a friend's acoustic guitar, paving the way for a career that would eventually take him far away from Eugene.\n\nMuch has changed since those days in the Pacific Northwest. Even so, Kearney hasn't forgotten his musical roots. On his fifth album, CRAZYTALK, he mixes his most timeless songwriting to date with a wide, genre-bending set of interests. There are organic instruments, electronic samples, chill house grooves, tropical sounds, and collaborations with DJs like AFSHeeN, filous, and RAC all glued together by an emphasis on ageless hooks and thought-provoking lyrics. The result is one of the most adventurous, nuanced albums of his acclaimed career, filled with EDM drops one minute and acoustic guitars the next.\n\nIt's a sound that nods to Kearney's history as a melody-driven songwriter, even as it pushes him into new territory.\n\n\"Back in Oregon, I was a punk skater kid who fell in love with Lauryn Hill, Tribe Called Quest, and Bel Biv Devoe,\" he says. \"At the same time, I also loved playing my buddy's guitar. In a way, I'll always be that kid, drawing from the influences I grew up with.\"\n\nCombing classic songs with modern, beat-heavy production, CRAZYTALK offers up a sound that's both cerebral and visceral. It's music for the head and the heart, but it's also music for the dance floor.\n\n\"At my core, I'm a songwriter,\" adds Kearney, who produced half of the album in his home studio in Nashville. \"I wanted to explore new production ideas with this album, though, to see how I could frame these songs in a different way. CRAZYTALK has some deep house influences, some African samples, some tropical sounds, and a lot of electronics \u2014 things that wouldn't normally be found in a singer/songwriter record \u2014 juxtaposed with some classic songs. It's a sound that really occupies its own lane.\"\n\nInspired in part by the birth of his first child in January 2017, Kearney found himself writing CRAZYTALK's lyrics with a new, mature perspective. He'd been a traveling songwriter for more than a decade, releasing three Top 20 albums along the way. The sound he helped introduce with his major-label debut, 2006's Nothing Left to Lose \u2014 a record that combined the bright sounds of pop music the with darker, harder-hitting influence of hip-hop \u2014 had since become one of the most common genres of the 21st century, with chart-topping artists like Ed Sheeran and Twenty One Pilots all following in his footsteps. His legacy already established, Kearney felt comfortable broadening his songwriting, filling CRAZYTALK with songs that embraced an older, wiser point of view.\n\n\"I realized I didn't need to make every song a 'young love story,'\" he says. \"I'm comfortable writing music from a perspective of having been around the block a few times, because that's how I am in real life. The result is some beautiful, wise songs that sound like they've been well-traveled.\"\n\nThe album's opening track, \"Better Than I Used to Be,\" takes a look at those early days in Kearney's backseat. It's a song about growing tall without forgetting your roots, laced with vocal effects, programmed percussion, and the familiar croon of Kearney's voice. That voice takes center stage on slower tracks like the modern, minimalist \"Memorized\" and a nuanced cover of Sade's \"By Your Side,\" with both songs proving that CRAZYTALK doesn't need lush, layered production to pack a punch.\n\nOn album highlights like \"Kings & Queens,\" though, Kearney makes room for an arsenal of instruments. He played many of them himself, beefing up the mix with digital samples and electronic flourishes. The album's songs were written in a similar way, with Kearney taking inspiration from organic instruments as well as synthesized loops.\n\n\"I'm a 50/50 guy,\" he explains of his songwriting process. \"I'll sit down with my acoustic guitar and write a song, but I\u2019ll also start with a beat, and then expand it into a song, like it was a hip-hop track. Those worlds can be opposites, but I've always played with both. I wrote the song 'Face to Face' on a ukulele, then added some percussion that sounded like 90s R&B. I wrote 'Sleeping at the Wheel with country songwriting legend Ross Copperman, then took it back to my studio and added an African sample with from a Bela Fleck record.\"\n\nCRAZYTALK also marks Kearney's first project as an independent artist. A major-label veteran whose previous albums were issued by Columbia and Republic, Kearney felt the need to create his fifth album with complete freedom.\n\n\"I'm now footing every bill and paying for every flight,\" he says, \"but it's beyond worth it. At this season of my life, putting out my fifth record, I really needed to take control creatively. I needed to take my own chances and combine these sounds that've been running through my head since I was a kid. I knew that some of it would sound like crazy talk to others, but that just gave me more fuel for the fire\u2026 as well as a name for the album.\"", "otherInfo": "http://www.youtube.com/savethechildren"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Matthew Caws ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jason Mraz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10392424.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Surf, Singer & Songwriter, Gospel, Healing & Easylistening, Acousic, Pop", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jason Mraz has quietly amassed a youthful, diverse, and vibrant fan-base throughout all parts of the globe.

It\u2019s a journey that has seen the country-rocker tour with superstars like Taylor Swift and Alan Jackson, play to over 50,000 people in Nashville at the world\u2019s biggest country music festival and build a large, devoted following as he\u2019s played the length and breadth of his native land and across the USA. Morgan has made his mark on the Australian musical landscape with a sound that fused contemporary country with melodic rock, fueled by a unique passion and energy all Morgan\u2019s own. His music is driven by an optimism shaped by life\u2019s bumpy journey, a faith in the power of love and hard work to overcome the obstacles we all face every day. Growing up in the working class beach city of Newcastle in NSW, Morgan turned the blue-collar ethic of his neighborhood into a relentless drive for energy and connection in his live shows. After seeing him whip a festival crowd into a frenzy, Warner Music Australia offered Morgan a recording contract. In 2013, after releasing two hit EPs that yielded three #1 singles, Morgan was named New Oz Artist of the Year at the CMC Music Awards. The fan voted award solidified his status as the hottest young performer in Australian country and was followed by four more trophies over the next two years, including back-to-back Male Oz Artist of the Year awards. Soon Morgan returned to Nashville to record his debut album with an all-star group of A-list musicians and Nashville based Aussie ex-pat producer Jedd Hughes. \u201cTo hear guys who played on the songs that inspired me to become a musician, playing on my songs, blew my mind,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt reminded me of why I was doing this in the first place and pushed me to take my vocals and guitar playing on the album to the next level\u201d. The songs that make up Morgan Evans are the result of a relentless songwriting schedule for almost a year that took Morgan to Nashville and back, and saw him tap into the deepest parts of himself. Morgan wrote eleven of the twelve tracks - some by himself, some with local artists and many with A-list Nashville writers. The album, released in March 2014, immediately shot to #1 on the iTunes and ARIA Country Album Charts and debuted at #20 on the ARIA Mainstream Album Chart. The impact of the acclaimed album has been immense \u2013 3 #1 singles (One Eye for an Eye, Best I Never Had and record-equaling Like A Tornado) and his first APRA nominations just for starters. The release also garnered international attention, leading to an invitation to return to Nashville\u2019s massive CMA Music Festival and perform at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, which prompted William Morris Endeavor \u2013 the world\u2019s largest talent agency \u2013 to sign Morgan up for international representation. Morgan\u2019s charisma and talent for engaging audiences led to his signing as the face of Foxtel\u2019s Country Music Channel, which has already seen him nominated for an ASTRA Award and a TV Week Logie Award \u2013 a first for an Australian country music star. He hosts television coverage of the CMC Rocks music festival, artist interviews and the CMC Music Awards. He was joined in 2016 by international co-host Kelsea Ballerini for the live national broadcast. A major career milestone was capped off when Morgan received a message from Grammy-winners Lady Antebellum informing him that he\u2019d been awarded the prestigious 2015 CMA Global Artist Award. The award recognizes outstanding achievement by an international country star in furthering the popularity of country music in their home country. Morgan joins an exceptional list of previous winners including Tommy Emmanuel, Kasey Chambers and Lee Kernaghan. Since then, Morgan has his sights set once again on Nashville, relocating to Music City where he has been writing with the A-list of songwriters for his upcoming US debut release and recently made return performances to CMA Music Fest and the Grand Ole Opry. His growing fanbase in both Australia and the USA is eagerly awaiting new music from Morgan, expected to be released later this year. http://www.morganevansmusic.com \"Kiss Somebody\" Out Now: https://wmna.sh/me_kisssomebod Twitter: @Morgan_Evans Instagram: @morganevansmusic Snapchat: themorganevans", "otherInfo": "http://www.youtube.com/savethechildren"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Will Joseph Cook ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7963672.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Royal Tunbridge Wells,United Kingdom", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New single 'Sweet Dreamer' out now: http://smarturl.it/SweetDreamer", "otherInfo": "https://www.youtube.com/savethechildren"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ripe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10392441.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Dance, Rock, Funk", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ripe is seven musical soulmates who refuse to believe in a single definition of dance music.

Longtime friend Mike Bishop Smith (drums) completes the trio. With a unique blend of genres, thoughtful lyrics and superb musicianship, the band has garnered and vast and diverse following. Releases include 8 singles, 3 EPs and 1 full length album.\n\nIn mid-2019, The Powell Brothers changed shape. The band of four and five pieces became a fierce three piece power trio. As a power trio, the group\u2019s sound evolved from roots influenced Country/Americana to alternative influenced Country/Rock. On July 1, 2020, The Powell Brothers released their new single entitled \u201cHow It\u2019s Done.\u201d \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is emblematic of the band\u2019s new hard hitting Country/Rock sound. The track has major attitude. Hot out of the gate, the listener is hit with powerful electric guitar riffs backed by a driving drum beat and gritty bass tones.\n\nThe story of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is based on a conversation between a young aspiring artist and an old man at a bar. The old man reflects on his life as a hardworking, blue collar laborer and the young artist shares his dream about \u201cmaking it\u201d in the music business. The old man tells the young artist that life is tough and the road is bumpy and long, but if he is willing to work hard enough he can accomplish anything. The chorus of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d sings:\n\nStoke the fire and keep on diggin\u2019\nmake the most of what you\u2019re given\nit may seem cold and it may seem tough\neven steel will bend when you heat it up\n\nYou\u2019re on the road to better days\nif you can outlast the sun and outlast the rain\nand a lot of hard lessons made\nLet me tell you son, soon you\u2019re gonna show us how it\u2019s done\n\nThis track will be on The Powell Brothers\u2019 next EP set to release in the Fall of 2020.

The New Orleans-based septet scored a game-changing hit with \u201cWish I Knew You,\u201d a wistful song from their third album, Men Amongst Mountains. Guided by dynamic percussion and punchy horns, the single features a contagious hook and feel-good chorus that has resonated with fans across all different genres. Though the album was released in July of 2015 (debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard Alternative Albums chart), the band's break out single \"Wish I Knew You\" has a rare and undeniable staying power. The song steadily picked up steam in 2016 spending over 40 weeks on the Billboard Adult Alternative Chart where it peaked at #1 and maintained for multiple weeks. By 2017, the song crossed to Alternative radio rising quickly to #1 and breaking the Billboard chart record for most single-week spins ever at Alternative radio. \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d then peaked inside the Top 15 at Adult Pop Radio and ultimately spent 9 weeks in the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe meaning behind \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d is up for debate and the band could not be happier about it. \u201cSome of the best songs are the ones that don\u2019t have just one meaning,\u201d says vocalist David Shaw. \u201cWe love hearing all the different interpretations our fans have. Of course the song talks about the idea of wishing for more time together earlier in life, but we\u2019ve heard all different takes on who that someone is, what the message means, and even what point of view the lyrics are coming from. We hope that people make our songs their own and \u2018Wish I Knew You\u2019 is like a canvas that our fans have filled with their imaginations and personal experiences. That is what we want our music to do.\u201d\n\nThe success of \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d has opened many doors for the band, earning them praise from the likes of Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, Buzzfeed, Flaunt, Paste and Interview, nabbing them a nod as a \u2018YouTube Artist on the Rise,\u2019 and landing them performances on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (the host called the song his \u201csummer jam\u201d), Conan, The Today Show, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where Shaw shared a rare and impromptu mid-performance dance with the star. \"That was a surreal moment for us,\" he marvels. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I\u2019d be dancing with Ellen DeGeneres!\u201d\n\nComprised of acclaimed musicians David Shaw [lead vocals/guitar], Zack Feinberg [guitar], Andrew Campanelli [drums], George Gekas [bass], Ed Williams [pedal steel guitar], Rob Ingraham [saxophone], Michael Girardot [keyboard & trumpet], The Revivalists are recognized as an extraordinary live band. And while \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d has had a seismic effect on their career, The Revivalists\u2019 relentless touring over the past several years has played a major part in getting them to this point.\n\nThe band has sold-out headlining tours in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and performed sets at such marquee festivals as Bonnaroo, Governor\u2019s Ball, Outside Lands, and Austin City Limits. This past year they were invited to perform on the main stage at New Orleans\u2019 Jazz Fest (after six years playing the second stage) for 40,000 people, attracted 5,000 fans to their show at Central Park\u2019s SummerStage in New York City, and visited cities like Toronto for the first time playing to packed houses.\n\n\u201cWe did it by building a live audience and our fans bringing their friends to see us,\u201d says Campanelli. \u201cSo when we got a song on the radio, it was tens of thousands of people saying, \u2018Our band is on the radio!\u2019 That has allowed it to expand because our fans are excited about it and are telling their friends. When we play the single, the new people who come to see us are not just holding up their phones for a video then leaving. They\u2019re singing every word because they\u2019ve become fans as well.\u201d \u201cPlaying live is the life blood of this band,\u201d agrees Shaw. \u201cIt\u2019s how we connect. There\u2019s no substitute for getting out there in someone\u2019s face, letting them see the veins popping out in your neck, or sweat dripping off your knuckles as you strum a guitar.\u201d\n\nThe four years that The Revivalists spent touring in support of their second album, City of Sound, informed many of the songs on Men Amongst Mountains, which was recorded live in just 21 days with producer Ben Ellman (Galactic, Trombone Shorty). Album opener \u201cKeep Going\u201d serves as an anthem for these road warriors. \u201cSometimes it was all of us packed into one hotel room,\u201d Shaw recalls of that time. \u201cIf we were lucky, we got two or three hotel rooms to split, so there was no personal space. You're eating fast food because you don't have any money. Those were trying times and all of that hardship went into the lyrics.\u201d The album\u2019s title was inspired during the band\u2019s stopover in Colorado where they were awestruck by the majestic grace of the surrounding mountains. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a metaphor for being small in a vast, expansive universe and knowing you are essentially insignificant, but standing amongst the mountains, you are among the greats, so it kind of elevates you,\u201d says Feinberg. \u201cIt's an uplifting title.\u201d\n\nAll members of The Revivalists share songwriting duties, with Shaw writing the lion\u2019s share of the lyrics. \u201cI draw inspiration from what is happening in my life and what I\u2019m being influenced by at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen life is tumultuous, I write more. When I\u2019m in the light, a person like me is almost seeking the dark. But when I\u2019m in the dark, I\u2019m like \u2018Get me out of this hole.\u2019 Songwriting is an escape; a way to externalize a lot of internal feelings.\u201d\n\nBy making the personal universal, The Revivalists have managed to attract a wide range of listeners who are also no doubt drawn to their eclectic rock sound, which has a bit of swing and a gritty Southern roots vibe. It\u2019s inspired perhaps not sonically \u2014 they are not a heritage brass band \u2014 but spiritually by their adopted hometown. \u201cThe mood we create in a room makes people feel like they\u2019re in New Orleans,\u201d says Campanelli of the band\u2019s free-wheeling show, which is filled with audience interaction and improvisation. \u201cWherever we go, we bring that vibe, spirit, energy, and looseness to the room that wasn\u2019t there the night before. We played a show in St. Louis and people lost their minds dancing. Afterward they told us, \u2018Wow, people don't dance in St. Louis.\u2019 That\u2019s what we bring. We make a Tuesday night in your town feel like New Orleans on a Saturday night.\u201d\n\nThe seeds of The Revivalists were planted in 2007 when Feinberg, out riding his bike, came across Shaw sitting on his front porch belting an original song called \u201cPurple Heart\u201d (which wound up on The Revivalists debut album Vital Signs). Shaw had moved to New Orleans two weeks prior for its rich musical history and because he had heard the city was in need of construction workers to help rebuild the city after Hurricane Katrina. (He had just graduated from Ohio State with a degree in construction management.) Feinberg had also moved to New Orleans for the music scene and to study psychology at Tulane University. He had only been in the dorms for an hour when everyone was forced to evacuate due to the impending hurricane. That day in August 2007, Feinberg and Shaw struck up a conversation and instantly began to jam and collaborate, establishing an immediate musical connection and friendship. Within weeks they had invited Campanelli, whom Feinberg had met through workshops at New Orleans music venue Tipitina\u2019s, to join them. Rounding out the band\u2019s line-up is Ingraham, Gekas, and Girardot, whom Feinberg and Campanelli knew from Tulane and Loyola respectively, as well as Williams, whom they all knew from the local music scene.\n\nThe Revivalists played clubs like Checkpoint Charlie\u2019s in New Orleans and Bamboo Willie\u2019s in Pensacola, which Shaw equates to The Beatles\u2019 \u201cHamburg Years,\u201d because of the epically long shows. \u201cWe played four to five hours a night and didn\u2019t have that much material, so we had to stretch and find ways to engage the crowd,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made it our mission to grab every single person\u2019s attention, which is what happened. By the end of the first set, everyone who had been standing at the bar would be standing at the front of the stage. That\u2019s when I started to realize we had something special.\u201d\n\nThey called themselves The Revivalists, which felt fitting given what the city was going through two years after the devastation of Katrina. \u201cNew Orleans was finally starting to rebound, and seeing it get back on its feet at the same time that this band, which respects older styles of music, was getting together, it just felt right as a name,\u201d says Feinberg. \u201cIt\u2019s about the excitement of this great American city, this great musical city, coming back to life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "http://www.youtube.com/savethechildren"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Yoke Lore ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8644692.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "tell me stories of how you're bound.", "otherInfo": "https://www.youtube.com/savethechildren"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Mastersons ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9571301.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Rock, Alt-country, Folk, Americana", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Don't bother asking The Mastersons where they're from. Brooklyn, Austin, Los Angeles, Terlingua; they've called each home in just the last few years alone. If you really want to get to know this husband-and-wife duo, the better question to ask is where they're going. Perhaps more than any other band playing today, The Mastersons live on the road, perpetually in motion and always creating. Movement is their muse. On tour, in the unpredictable adventures and characters they cross, in the endless blur of skylines and rest stops and dressing rooms and hotels, that's where they find their greatest inspiration, where they hone their art, and where they crafted their brilliant new album, Transient Lullaby. \"When you travel like we do, if your antenna is up, there's always something going on around you,\" reflects guitarist/singer Chris Masterson. \"Ideas can be found everywhere. The hardest thing to find is time.\" For the last seven years, The Mastersons have kept up a supremely inexorable touring schedule, performing as both the openers for Steve Earle and as members of his band, The Dukes, in addition to playing their own relentless slate of headline shows and festivals. It was Earle, in fact, who pushed the duo to record their acclaimed debut, Birds Fly South, in the first place. \"Before we hit the road with him in 2010, Steve said, 'You'd better have a record ready because I'm going to feature you guys during the show,'\" remembers fiddler/tenor guitarist/singer Eleanor Whitmore. \"We didn't even have a band name at the time. We were going through all these ideas and Steve suggested, 'Why don\u2019t you just be The Mastersons, and that was that.\" Upon its release in 2012, Birds Fly South was a breakout critical hit on both sides of the pond, with Uncut awarding the album 9/10 stars and Esquire dubbing The Mastersons one of the \u201cBands You Need To Know Right Now\u201d. Two years later, they followed it up with Good Luck Charm, premiered by the NY Times and praised by Mother Jones for its \"big-hearted lyrics, tight song structures, and sweetly intertwined harmonies.\" Pop Matters ranked it \"among the top Americana releases of 2014,\" while American Songwriter called it \"a perfect soundtrack for a summer of warm nights and hot, lazy days,\" and the Austin Chronicle praised the band's \"spunky wit and rare measure of emotional maturity.\" The album earned The Mastersons slots on NPR's Mountain Stage and at festivals around the world, from San Francisco's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass to Australia's Byron Bay Bluesfest. With endless touring came new levels of comfort and confidence, and when it was time to record Transient Lullaby, The Mastersons knew they wanted to take a different approach than their first two releases. The band set up shop at Arlyn Studios in Austin, TX, where Chris shared production duties with longtime friend and collaborator George Reiff (Ray Wylie Hubbard, Band of Heathens). Together, they chased a sound that was subtler and more evocative, deeper and more contemplative. \"A lot of what we listen to when we have some rare time off is what we consider late night music,\" explains Chris, who previously played guitar with Son Volt and Jack Ingram among others. \"The last record was bright and jangly and we wanted this one to be vibey and dark. A lot of the stuff is very performance-based and not at all fussed with. We've grown so much more comfortable in our skin that we really weren't trying to sound like anyone other than ourselves this time around.\" \"We've had a lot of time and a lot of miles to refine our sound and our style of singing,\" adds Eleanor, whose resume includes work with Regina Spektor and Angus & Julia Stone. \"I think the depth of our songwriting has really grown, too. Part of the time we're writing on a tour bus with Steve Earle, and the bar for poetry is pretty high when you're within earshot of one of the greatest songwriters alive.\" Rich with Eleanor's stirring string arrangements and Chris's masterful guitar work, the songs on Transient Lullaby more than live up to the challenge. The album opens with \"Perfect,\" a loping duet written partially in Washington, DC, and partially in Newcastle, England, that paints a portrait of two broken lovers who still manage to find a strange optimism in this challenging world. Spare and affecting, the song puts the spotlight on the duo's intoxicating vocal harmonies and makes for an ideal entry point into an album full of characters facing down difficulty and darkness with all the grit and humility they can muster. \"Fight,\" written in a downtown Cleveland hotel, is a wry wink at the battlefield of marriage (\"I don't wanna fight with anyone else but you\"), while the fingerpicked \"Highway 1\" twists and turns on a California road trip through an emotional breakup. \"Life's not easy,\" reflects Chris. \"It's hard for everybody, and I don\u2019t see it getting any easier. All you can hope for yourself is grace when walking through it, and someone to prop you up when you need a little help.\" Though it's a deeply personal album, Transient Lullaby is not without its political moments. The Mastersons found themselves on tour in Lexington, KY, during the height of Kim Davis' obstinate stand against the Supreme Court's same sex marriage decision, and so they penned the infectious \"You Could Be Wrong\" in a dressing room before taking the stage with \"Love Wins\" draped across their guitars. \"This Isn't How It Was Supposed To Go\"\u2014a cosmic country duet written in Cologne, Germany\u2014has taken on new layers of political meaning in 2017, while \"Don't Tell Me To Smile\" is a tongue-in-cheek feminist anthem, and the gorgeous, slow-burning \"Fire Escape\"\u2014which came to life in a hockey rink locker room in Alberta, Canada\u2014suggests that the only solution to a polarized world of fear and distrust is to find strength and guidance in our loved ones. \"As we look at the world political landscape, global warming, a refugee crisis and the uncertain times we\u2019re all living in, rather than lose hope, we look to each other,\" Chris says. \"It\u2019s a little brighter than Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, but not much.\" Ultimately, the road is at the core of everything The Mastersons do. \"Happy When I'm Movin'\" reflects their constant need for forward momentum, both physically and emotionally, and the title track paints the pair as \"pilgrims of the interstate\" on an endless voyage. \"No I don\u2019t unpack my bag / Traveling from town to town,\" they sing in beautiful harmony. \"Set \u2019em up and knock \u2019em down / Where there\u2019s work and songs to sing / You\u2019ll know the place where I\u2019ll be found / If you don\u2019t want to be alone / Then come along.\" For The Mastersons, all that matters is where they're headed, and the songs they'll write when they get there.

However, you\u2019ll get to know Ryan like never before on his forthcoming 2014 EP and fifth full-length album. Stardom aside, it\u2019s never ever been about image, media, or pomp and circumstance for Cabrera. It\u2019s always come down to one thing: the music. It\u2019s where everything starts\u2026\nIn 2009, he began writing songs for what would eventually become record number five. However, the inspiration didn\u2019t quite click right off the bat. So, he continued cataloging his thoughts and emotions over the next few years. He immersed himself in other artistic pursuits such as painting\u2014actually decking out his home with all original work enjoying his own personal renaissance.\nHe also spent meaningful time at hospitals around the country, brightening up the day for countless sick children and young adults. Inspired from this, Cabrera also took the opportunity to launch a live music series entitled Live From Ryan\u2019s Living Room, which airs bi-monthly. Utilizing stageit.com, he broadcasts live performances from his living room and all proceeds for \u201conline tickets\u201d benefit different charities. Everybody from Colbie Caillat and Gavin DeGraw to Billy Ray Cyrus and We The Kings has joined him in the Living Room for unique live jams.\nAmidst this creative upswing, 2013 ushered in something of a new awakening for Cabrera. After penning \u201cI See Love\u201d in Nashville with Nathan Chapman [Taylor Swift], he experienced a revelation. \u201cThat sparked the mindset of the new album,\u201d he affirms. \u201cIt was about writing songs that are real and honest. It was, \u2018Write what you love and are passionate about\u2019. That ignited the entire record.\u201d\nHe went back to Los Angeles reinvigorated and locked himself in the studio with producer Justin Gray [Mariah Carey, John Legend, Amy Winehouse]. Together, the duo wrote and performed the bulk of the album, playing all of the instruments themselves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s organic pop music,\u201d Cabrera declares. \u201cJustin and I hit it off immediately. We were in a room together, jamming on everything. We weren\u2019t trying to be anything or fit any kind of mold. It was just music we dug. I started writing all of these fun, positive, and uplifting songs. My whole perception had changed. Every song tells its own story.\u201d\n\u201cHouse On Fire\u201d shimmies from a percussive tribal intro into an incendiary refrain. He smiles, \u201cIt\u2019s about burning everything down and being crazy while you can. You\u2019re living in the moment and enjoying everything you do. A lot of people are afraid to let themselves go, be passionate, and express their feelings. You\u2019ve got to burn it all down\u2014even if just for one night. Let loose and go nutty! It feels great.\u201d\n\u201cEverest\u201d begins with a pronounced bounce punctuated by swooning synths, a propulsive beat, and lithe harmonies. Cabrera carries a simultaneously invigorating and inspiring hook to the summit confidently. \u201cIt\u2019s about waking up, loving life, and reaching the highest spot,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou start your day, and you\u2019re trying to reach the utmost point you can in everything you do. You\u2019re doing your best no matter what.\u201d\nAt the same time, Cabrera still knows how to write a touching love song. \u201cAll We Have\u201d captures a distinct moment that\u2019s both heartbreaking and hypnotic. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the love songs,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s about that relationship that got away. Maybe you made a mistake. Now, you\u2019re making your plea about why you should be together. You admit you\u2019re wrong, but you still want to be together.\u201d\nUltimately, this is the real Ryan Cabrera. He doesn\u2019t hold anything back, and he\u2019s created his most uplifting and powerful music to date.\n\u201cI want the music to speak for itself,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMy career has been about a lot of things from the outside. The focus unfortunately shifted to what my hair was like or who I was dating. That\u2019s not why I started playing music. It\u2019s always been about the music. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s not about being a pop singer. It\u2019s about being an artist. I want people to think of the songs before they think of me. It starts now.

Pianist Kenny Hensley learned to fly planes and enrolled in kung-fu training in China, while bassist Chris Zasche packed up a camper and went off the grid in the Canadian Rockies. Drummer Tyler Williams put down stakes across the country and immersed himself in the burgeoning music scene in Richmond, Va., while vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Charity Rose Thielen honed her compositional skills by writing for such legends as Mavis Staples.\n\nAfter his own cross-country trip to reconnect with family and friends, vocalist/guitarist Jonathan Russell traveled to Haiti and found inspiration working with the non-profit Artists For Peace And Justice. \"When I found out we were going to have a significant amount of time off, I saw it as an opportunity to touch base again -- to listen to what other people were saying and what they were going through,\" he says. \"I really wanted to make sure that I reconnected with a world that was starting to feel farther and farther away.\"\n\nWhen they regrouped last summer in Stinson Beach, Ca., to start writing together again, \"it almost felt like we were a new band, trying things we hadn't tried,\" Zasche recalls. \"We stayed at a bungalow on the beach. We'd wake up, have coffee and go boogie boarding. We were ready and excited to be back together.\"\n\nThat renewed sense of purpose can be felt throughout Signs Of Light, the group's first release for Warner Bros. Records. \"This album isn't about us now having achieved our dreams,\" says Thielen. \"The day we started being able to live off our art was the day we achieved our dreams, in my mind. This is the album where we really fell into our true voices as those artists.\"\n\nRecorded in Nashville with producer Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Cage The Elephant), Signs Of Light, crackles with the upbeat, sing-a-long energy of the Head And The Heart's finest work. Lead single \"All We Ever Knew,\" which was written during the \"Let's Be Still\" era but never captured to the band's satisfaction until now, is sure to be a crowd-pleaser, while \"Turn It Around\" seems primed to be a future concert staple, matching its inspirational message with a lush and multi-layered soundscape.\n\nThroughout, the colors are brighter, the electric guitars are louder and the musical touchstones more universal. The propulsive, smile-inducing ode to Los Angeles \"City Of Angels\" and the head-nodding \"Rhythm & Blues\" nod to classic Fleetwood Mac, while the organ-flecked \"Dreamer\" is a timeless-sounding ballad that could have been beamed straight out of an old jukebox.\n\n\"Jay was really adamant about getting a great performance,\" group member Jonathan Russell says. \"We have all the tools in the world to make something sound real or more excitable, but it's never really as true as the band in the room for the whole take. 'City Of Angels' - we had previously re-cut that song and played it so many times. But within two takes in Nashville, we nailed it. It felt like we were playing on a massive stage in front of tons of people.\"\n\nElsewhere, Thielen's \"Library Magic\" could almost be seen as a letter to the other five members, acknowledging the ups-and-downs of life in a successful band while celebrating the unique and constantly evolving bond between them. \"I wrote that song after having our first real time off as a band,\" she says. \"It touches on the storied relationships between band members trying to survive living in a van off of accelerated time and gas station crafts for years straight, but it also applies to any of life's relationships.\"\n\nThe Head And The Heart's 2011 self-titled debut album captured a nascent but undeniable creative partnership between six strangers thrown together by little more than a shared love of music. It became one of Sub Pop Records' best-selling debut releases ever, and rocketed the band to acclaim well beyond its then-home base in Seattle. The formative experiences that followed both on and off the stage heavily informed the 2013 follow-up \"Let's Be Still,\" which continues to remind Russell of \"the stale beer, bleach and potato chips from all the venues we saw once this became our livelihood.\"\n\nOn Signs Of Light, that gamut of emotions is felt most deeply on the Josiah Johnson-penned title track, which none of the other members had ever heard until they happened to walk in on him playing it over and over at the piano during pre-production in El Paso, Texas. \"It was one of those moments where no one talks,\" Russell remembers. \"No one needs the chords; no one is looking up.

His grandmother, a piano graduate of The Juilliard School, taught him to play the piano and encouraged his musical development. He graduated from Phillips Academy in 1988, after which he studied semiotics at Brown University.\n\nSheik began his professional musical career playing for other acts, including Liz And Liza (with Lisa Loeb and Liz Mitchell), and played on His Boy Elroy's 1993 album. Through connections from fellow Brown alum Tracee Ellis Ross, Sheik's music gained the attention of executives at Atlantic Records. Duncan Sheik's eponymous debut album for Atlantic spawned the 1996 hit single \"Barely Breathing\" in the US, which remained on the charts for 55 straight weeks. In 1998, he was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Barely Breathing.\"\n\nIn addition to his work as a solo artist, he collaborates with the poet and writer Steven Slater.

May\u2019s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.\n\nRaised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nErlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country, swing, soul, and even rock n\u2019 roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.\n\nWith a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine\u2019s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC\u2019s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys, and others.\n\nErlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in our world. May's body of work has become an anthem and an example of why we need to listen to women, and why we need to hear their stories.\n\nMay\u2019s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times. When she starts to sing, there\u2019s no way around it: welcome in, everyone.

Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN.

But all along, I've really always been writing for myself. When I started writing songs at ten years old, it was because I wanted to sing them, and when I came to Nashville, I came to be a songwriter and a singer. It's all one thing to me.\"\n\nAfter relocating from his native South Carolina to Music City, the former Clemson lineman dove headfirst into his craft, writing on his own and with a slew of talented musicians he fell in with. He found early success, with songs picked up by established artists like Jason Aldean and Keith Gattis. Though they may have been sung by other artists, those songs were stories from deep within Lee's own heart.\n\n\"'More Than A Memory' was a very personal song for me,\" he says of his breakout 2007 track. \"I was thinking about keeping it for myself when Garth Brooks called, and that changed the whole dynamic.\"\n\nIt changed a whole lot of things. Brooks' recording of the track was the first single in the history of the Billboard Hot Country Songs Chart to debut at #1. Lee's stock skyrocketed in Nashville, and that same year, he signed with Curb Records and began laying the groundwork for his inexorable rise as a solo artist.\n\nHe released his debut album, Love Like Crazy, in 2009. The title track reached #3 on the Billboard Country chart and set a record as the longest-charting song in that chart's history. In 2012, he topped his own success with Hard 2 Love, an album that went Gold and featured three #1 Country singles, including \"I Drive Your Truck,\" which won Song of the Year at both the CMA and ACM Awards. The record earned raves from NPR to Country Weekly and found the New York Times hailing him as \"a sensitive macho man,\" a compliment that perfectly encapsulates both sides of Brice's persona. Hard 2 Love also garnered Lee his late-night debut, a stirring performance of \"I Drive Your Truck\" on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d\n\n\"On my first record, I had all these ideas and sounds I didn't know how to get out of me,\" Brice remembers, crediting frequent collaborator Doug Johnson with helping him learn some of the early ropes of recording. \"On Hard 2 Love, I figured out that I could really step out and try things in the studio, and if they don't work they don't work, but sometimes those ideas become the basis of how you record some tracks.\u201d\n\nBrice took it a step further on I Don't Dance, relishing the role of producer with a flair for experimentation as yet another way to mold and shape his songs to match the sounds he'd been chasing in his head.\n\n\"I wanted to have control over every drumbeat, every lick of the bass part,\" he explains of his meticulous approach in the studio. \"It was a lot of really sitting down and thinking about every little piece that goes into it.\"\n\nRather than approach the record as a whole entity, Brice listened to what each song called for and played to its strengths, allowing the warmth and presence of his personality to form the cohesive thread that binds them all together. On the lighthearted summer anthem \u201cGirls In Bikinis,\u201d he built the track entirely from the ground up, playing every single instrument himself. The searing \u201cSirens,\u201d on the other hand, was cut live and loud in the studio, with raw electric guitars and a banjo part that captured Brice's first time playing the instrument. Other tracks grew out of drum loops and studio experiments, inspired in part by his love of recent albums from Bruno Mars and Eminem. Live-show- moment \u201cDrinking Class,\u201d one of three songs on the album not written by Brice, taught him a valuable lesson about hearing what the music calls for. \"We had ideas to put a lot of electronic sounds in it,\" he explains, \"but after we cut it, I had a feeling that this is really a song about the working class, and it needed those sounds, like chain gang stomps and claps and hums, and now I have a sledgehammer hitting a railroad tie on there. I changed everything about it to get it back to its roots. Sometimes you gotta go to a lot of the wrong places to get to the right places, and that's not wasted time. It takes that trip to get to where you're going.\"\n\n\"Panama City\" is another track that took a circuitous journey to its final destination on the new album. Written by his good friend Chris Thompkins, the track first caught Brice's ear a decade ago when he heard a stripped-down arrangement of it on one of Thompkins' work tapes.\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t imagine it being any different than what I heard on the work tape,\" says Brice. \"I said we had to do it live because I didn't want to give myself the option of redoing vocals or piano or bringing in background singers later. They brought the piano out into the main room of Ocean Way Studios [in Nashville], which is an old church, and we took our headphones off, had no click tracks, no drums. It's like they did 50 years ago. We played it four times and the last time was perfect. I took it off the board exactly the way we recorded it and mastered it, and it's my favorite track on the record by far.\u201d Perhaps the most personal song on the album, though, is the title track, which Brice wrote for the first dance at his May 2013 wedding. As with so much of his work, the lyrics are inspired by his undying love for his wife, Sara, but they resonate with a huge audience. Top wedding website The Knot recently selected it for the \"Dream Wedding\" they threw for a pair of Boston Marathon bombing survivors.\n\n\"It's my favorite song I've ever written in my life,\" says Lee, \"and I don\u2019t know that that'll ever change.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/foldsofhonortn"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Edwin McCain ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6798871.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-26", "Genre": "Singer, Songwriter, Folk, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Edwin McCain (born January 20, 1970 in Greenville, South Carolina) is an alternative and indie rock guitar player.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What! The Good, the Mad, and the Ugly\u201d, an edited compilation of the band\u2019s fan club magazine spanning 10 years from 1994 to 2004.\n\nAnd still the \u2018Madly In Anger With The World\u2019 tour continued, selling out venues right through to it\u2019s final date in San Jose, California on November 29, 2004.\n\nThey did publicly state that the majority of 2005 would be spent re-charging those creative and mental batteries, and true to their word it was a quiet year, except for two little hometown gigs with the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in November. We all knew an entire year would not pass without at least a sighting of the guys!\n\nWith batteries re-charged after the two shows with the Stones, the guys hit the studio in early 2006 to start writing a new album and were excited to announce that they would be working with a new producer, Rick Rubin. The spring and summer found them escaping from the studio once again with shows in South Africa (their first ever visit to the continent!), Europe, Japan and Korea. \u201cThe New Song\u201d made its debut in Berlin, Germany on June 6 to give us all a little taste of things to come in 2007 with the remainder of the year scheduled for more writing and jamming.", "otherInfo": "Live From The Archives"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mark Wills ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10316169.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-26", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Reader\u2019s Digest version of Mark Wills\u2019 story makes it clear he\u2019s an award-winning singer\u2019s singer. His matchless phrasing, passionate and meaningful delivery and right-on-the money vocals make each and every song he performs come alive. Like a picture perfect painting, Wills\u2019 music is a vocal work of art that walks right off the canvas and into the hearts of country music lovers alike.\n\nBringing the Wills\u2019 dimension to some of the greatest songs ever written, he\u2019s not necessarily become known for being trendy, hip or even on the cutting edge, but rather and simply as a damn good singer!\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a good storyteller to make a son g meaningful. Whether romantic or \u2018reality,\u2019 my focus is on the music delivery to make it my own for the people who listen\u2014so that they can make it their own.\u201d\n\nAnd the people listen...\n\nHis list of accolades is his testament. Mark Wills is a multi-platinum selling country music star with eight top 10 hits to his name including \u201c19 Something,\u201d \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Laugh At Me;\u201d all of which received nominations for Single, Song and Video of the Year by the Country Music Association. Wills won the Academy of Country\nMusic's award for Top New Male Vocalist in 1998. In 2002, his single \u201c19 Something\u201d spent six consecutive weeks at No. 1, was Billboard\u2019s top country hit of the year and was the second most-played song of the decade in 2009.\n\n\u2026and that\u2019s just a chapter in Mark Wills\u2019 life story.\n\nSince garnering his Top New Male Vocalist recognition in 1998, Wills has become a staple in country music, like salt and pepper on a table; the chapters may have changed, but the story continues. The father of two daughters, a husband and the head of household, Mark\u2019s role in life and music are one in the same.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019ve seen all sides of me! I\u2019ve become more aware of who I am not only as an artist, but as a father, a husband and a friend\u2026and as a dad, I want to put out music my children can listen to; all in all, I take more ownership in it.\u201d\n\nHis ownership is made evident in his newest collection of recordings on the CD entitled LOOKING FOR AMERICA; an assortment of tunes Mark describes as different, yet the same.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA is a project with no \u2018sacrifices.\u2019 With titles like \u201cSmoking Gun,\u201d \u201cWhere Did I Lose You,\u201d \u201cA Whole World\u201d and \u201cRocking The Country,\u201d the tracks are not just about a rhyme and a hook, they\u2019re a menagerie of people-stories--a musical exhibition of heart-heavy, romantic, comedic all-American existence with apple pie flavor. Describing the hue of the music, Wills colors his music \u201cdark blue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of many personalities with a lot that I want to say. There\u2019s a fun, down-home side of me, and then there\u2019s an emotional, serious side. I think LOOKING FOR AMERICA, topically, is a human interest story of love, tragedy and life\u2019s unexpected.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has ever seen him in concert, or has met with him personally, knows that inside this humble, good ol' boy, country singer dwells a soul who just wants to speak to and for all with his music. LOOKING FOR AMERICA delivers music with a no-holds-barred edge softened with a trademarked tenor vocal that will capture the attention of music lovers from every genre from first cut to last.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA clearly raises the flag to demonstrate the responsibility he feels to Americans alike, and specifically our military, with the title cut and \u201cCrazy Being Home.\u201d\n\nWills has made more seven trips to entertain our troops; he is familiar with the places they\u2019ve been. His trips have taken him to Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. He has also performed at several events for the Champions for Champions Organization, the USO\nand a variety of Fallen Soldier Charities here in the U.S. Having become personally acquainted with the faces of our brothers and sisters of the military, LOOKING FOR AMERICA is dedicated in part to these brave individuals.\n\n\"First of all, it's a privilege to provide a little joy and entertainment for these people. The first time I went, it was a life-changing experience. The freedom that we have is not something that I take for granted--they're literally giving their lives for us. By playing a show for them or releasing a song that shares their emotional story, it\u2019s my way, however minimal, to say \u2018Thank You.\u2019\u201d\n\nSupporting our troops is just one of a number of philanthropic endeavors Mark Wills dedicates his time and effort to. He has aligned with USA Cares to launch a national awareness campaign surrounding the severity of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Since 2007, Mark has been the\nspokesperson for the Children\u2019s Miracle Network and its annual celebrations.\n\nAs an active representative, he accompanies miracle children to Walt Disney World and then to Washington each year as part of a national awareness campaign; the children enjoy lunch with Congress and a trip to the White House to meet with the President.\n\nTurning the page from bringing all-American music to life to his own brush with death, Wills was caught by surprise by an unexpected, eye-opening crisis. In October 2010, Mark experienced what felt like a \u201cpoke\u201d in his side that was followed by flu-like symptoms. A visit to the doctor took him straight to the emergency room. \u201cThe nurse said, \u2018we have to admit you immediately,\u2019 I said, \u2018I need to go home to let the girls know,\u2019 her response to me was, \u2018You don\u2019t have the time.\u201d Mark suffered from an intestinal infection that could have taken his life, but he pulled through with a nine-inch long scar to remind him of its value.\n\n\u201cIt was a dire circumstance and it gave me a whole new perspective in all aspects of my life.\u201d\n\nA man whose appetite for life surpasses what most people can only dream of \u2013 a dedicated parent, philanthropist, outdoorsman, jokester \u2013 but, more than anything, else Mark Wills is an artist and, behind the artist, is an even better singer.\n\n\u201cWhen the story comes to \u2018The End,\u2019 I just want to be remembered as a great singer - who sang great songs \u2013 and used his talents to not only speak to people but was the voice for many.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Hudson, NY", "Artist": "Rhett Miller ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6179843.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.791, 42.2529], "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Alternative Country, Songwriter, Singer, Folk, Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "@StageIt", "moreBioInfo": "I've made 16 studio albums.

Since graduating, he has played in a variety of live and studio settings with a bevy of pop, jazz, and R&B artists including Natalie Cole, Jennifer Lopez, Dave Koz, Brian Culbertson, Rick Braun, Gerald Albright, Manhattan Transfer, Peabo Bryson, Euge Groove, and many more.\n\nAlthough he had originally planned to record a solo album in 2005, the abundance of live and session opportunities kept him busy.

A year later, he released his full-length debut Just the Beginning, which featured guest appearances by Culberson, Albright, Groove, Eric Darius, and Michael Lington.

All types of music. I remember the melodies and beats rattling the floorboards. My childhood had a soundtrack filled up with everything from R&B and jazz to rock and Motown.\u201d For many recording sessions, Sales would sit on the console and watch.\n\nThe family relocated to Portland, Oregon when Sales was four. Within several months, Sales began playing piano and participating in local musical theatre productions. At the age of five, something happened that altered her life indefinitely. \u201cMy friend was playing a tape of Judy Garland singing \u2018Get Happy.\u201d I can\u2019t explain it. But I was captivated. I was in love\u2026maybe obsessed. I couldn\u2019t stop listening. I made my friend play the song over and over again until she finally just took out the cassette and gave it to me. I went home that night and listened ten more times.\u201d Sales learned to sing by studying the voices of Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, among others.\n\nBefore reaching sixth grade, she had begun writing songs and likewise had performed in over one hundred productions, interviewed the Dalai Lama, toured the US singing with a saint from India, and performed at the Pentagon for the WWII Ace Pilots Convention. By middle school, Sales was accepted into the private performing arts school, The Northwest Academy, where she studied both classical and jazz music, film making, acting and dance. She continued to study until graduating two years early, with honors, at sixteen.\n\nFollowing graduation, her family moved again, this time to an organic blueberry farm on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. \u201cI thought my life was over,\u201d Sales laughs. \u201cI went from a cutting edge, urban arts school to a farm on an island floating off the coast of Canada.\u201d The dramatic shift, however, proved to be beneficial. \u201cI spent every second of the day learning the technical side of music in the studio or sitting in my bedroom writing songs. Music was all that I had. Besides my own company. \u201c\n\nWithin a half a year of her family relocating to Vancouver Island, Sales landed the main role in a horror film, leading to a move down to Los Angeles to pursue acting. Over the next six months living on her own, Sales performed with Paula Abdul, recorded vocals for a Saudi Arabian prince and nearly took up an offer by Wynn Casino to have her own show. The move ended abruptly when a bout of acid reflux caused by an eating disorder made her lose her voice. \u201cFor over a year, I could barely whisper. Everything that I had identified with was gone. I was speechless. Literally,\u201d she recalls.\n\nWhen her voice finally returns, Sales quickly returned into the studio and recorded a full length demo album which she released on her own label, Drifter Records, at the age of 17. In 2006, Sales was signed by Randy Lennox to Universal Music Canada. Her first album, Sunseed, was released in 2007, with singles \u2018What You Want\u2019 and \u2018Keep Drivin\u2019 landing in the Canadian Top 40 and on the charts in both Australia and Japan. Sales\u2019 mesmerizing, sultry vocals and infectious melodies caught on instantly. In 2008, she won Best Mainstream Artist at The Canadian Radio Music Awards. Her sophomore album, featuring guest appearances by G Love and Donavon Frankenreiter, \u201cWhen The Bird Became a Book\u201d, was released in 2012. The music video for \u2018Just Pretend\u2019, directed by Josh Forbes (The Fray, Sarah Bareilles) generated over five million views within three weeks of its release. During this time, Sales received a Juno for her part in Young Artists For Haiti and toured with INXS, The Spice Girls, Jason Mraz, Feist, Gavin DeGraw, among others. Recently, \u2018More Than You Know\u2019 and \u2018When The Wind Blows,\u2019 both tracks off her second record, were added to official Spotify playlists.\nSales decided to go independent for her third record, raising money through Pledge Music to begin recording. The record was self-penned, co-produced with her dad, Richard Sales, mixed by Michael Brauer (Electric Lady Studios), and featured string and horn arrangements by Carl Marsh (Etta James, James Brown, Stax Volt). In 2016, nearing the completion of \u201cThe Misadventures,\u201d Sales signed with a major label in the US. But less than a month after she delivered the master, due to a series of changes within the label and its parent company, the finished record was shelved. To this day, the major label will not allow her to buy back her masters.\n\nMeanwhile, as Sales wasn\u2019t legally allowed to release music, she dove into her acting career. Within a short amount of time, Sales landed the role of Hope Summers in Deadpool 2, the leading role in upcoming musical film, Stand!, and has made guest star appearance on Supergirl, and Supernatural among others.\n\nIn 2018, Sales received a recording grant from Creative BC and she quickly jumped back into the studio. Taking on the role of producer, editor, engineer and songwriter, Sales just finished an 18 song album. \u201cI am incredibly excited about this next album,\u201d she says. \u201cOver the past couple years, I have been so humbled by rejection and disappointment, so battered down to nothing, that I have nothing to lose. I\u2019ve realized that the only thing of true importance, the only thing that really matters to me, is to make music that presses out the edges out of my heart\u2026to make music that strips me naked, exposes the most breakable parts of myself, and hopefully in doing so, helps a listener feel less alone\u2026and to be honest, makes me feel the same. Someone once told me \u2018If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, what songs would you sing?\u2019 Well, this record is just that. I\u2019m putting everything I am into it. Having so much of myself torn to shreds, so much heartbreak and frustration; it is my solace.\u201d\nHer fourth album, \"RICOCHET,\" was completed late 2019 and will begin releasing singles May 2020.", "otherInfo": "Excited to be joining the lineup at Hotel Cafe this Monday!

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

With their technical and musical skills, the musicians have found ways to extend the harmonic expressions of ordinary trios in many cases. Although formed like a classic jazz trio the Jazz Pistols have developed a sensational variety of sound which they can easily translate live without the need for loops and overdubs. Their so-called Energy-Jazz is defined by its groove-oriented integration of melody and harmony. One of the strengths of the Jazz Pistols is the ease of use of odd meters in pieces as a compositional device.\nThey are able to discover new elements and levels of performance - a fact that not only surprises themselves, but also their audiences.This versatility is one of the strengths of the Jazz Pistols.\nIt is rare that Jazz-Rock \u2013 notoriously known as the music for musicians \u2013 is able to create this fascination on listeners \u2013 even when they normally don\u00b4t like fusion music. The extraordinary density of sound, the catchy melodies of the complex pieces, and culture of the musicianship \u2013 the Jazz Pistols are quite different from similar bands.\n\nStefan Ivan Sch\u00e4fers striking and variabel guitar sound carries and leads the band through ballads and hard groove pieces. His solos with their catchy melodies melt into the compositions and are truly extraordinary.\nThrough his extraordinary tapping technique Christoph Victor Kaiser constantly is the harmonic backing of the band and simultaneously creates surprising parts of musical intensification.\nWith Jazz Pistols Thomas Lui Ludwig develops a polyrhythmic firework of extraordinary proportions, he is not only constant support but manages at the same time to detach himself from traditional forms.\n\nEach member of the group is an accomplished musician with his individual style. The band combines their very differnet talents into an exciting ensemble featuring varied original compositions, arrangements rich in texture, and infectious solo performances.\n\nIt is surprising for a trio to show such expressiveness, variety of style and versatility; thats the reason why the Jazz Pistols captivate their audiences with this compactness and flexibility.\n\nSince 1995 the Jazz Pistols toured through 33 countries worldwide. Beside that they played with Jeff Beck, Chaka Khan, Joss Stone, Vanilla Ninja and many more, are part of the Uwe Ochsenknecht Band, lecturers, guest-lecturers and notable workshoph leaders at the Popakademie Mannheim and universities in Germany and other countries.", "otherInfo": "25 years Jazz Pistols - join us for a concert with the Jazz Pistols - it might be the only one this year.

One of our most compelling singers, she is at home in R&B but made her mark in country, bringing the entire spectrum of popular music to bear on music she calls \u201cSouthern Soul.\u201d\n\nHer new album, Revival, is her most powerful work to date. The product of a mature artistic vision, laser-focused social consciousness, and a voice with the power and grace only experience can bring, it is also her most important work. Revival finds Rissi dealing with some of the most pressing issues of the times, as well as with the personal realms of love, loss, and identity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most personal things I\u2019ve written and recorded,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything I write is personal, but I feel like I\u2019m in a place of being really honest and transparent with people, because that\u2019s what I like in an artist. That\u2019s what I look for; those are the people I\u2019m interested in, and I want to do that same thing for others.\u201d\n\nThe first single from the project, \u201cSeeds,\u201d along with its riveting video, finds Rissi taking an unflinching look at tensions as old as humanity and as fresh as today\u2019s headlines, with a message that joins biblical themes and modern equality movements. \u201cSeeds\u201d celebrates human freedom and dignity in the face of oppression, counseling understanding and communication in a spirit of hope and unity.\n\n\u201c\u2018Seeds\u2019 is a crowd favorite and has been since I wrote it,\u201d she says, \u201cand so it was the first thing I recorded and put out from this record. It\u2019s the first thing you hear on the album and it sets the tone for everything else you\u2019re about to hear.\u201d\n\nTwo of the other key tracks are \u201cSoul Message,\u201d written just after she married her husband Bryan, and the powerful \u201cYou Were Here,\u201d written after her miscarriage.\n\n\u201c\u2018Soul Message\u2019 is the only love song on this album, and having been married now for nine years I feel like this is pretty expressive of what marriage is. There are times when all you can do is dig deeper and reach out to each other from a visceral soul place because regular communication is not getting it. It\u2019s one of my favorite songs on the record, and I love the production that Brian Owens, my producer, came up with. It just totally fits, with this kind of old Muscle Shoals-ish vibe. \u2018You Were Here\u2019 is probably one of the hardest songs I\u2019ve ever written. Thank God for my cowriters Deanna Walker and Rick Beresford\u2014I think I sobbed the entire time we wrote it. I was struck by how many of my friends have experienced this and don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s a profoundly lonely experience even if you have a partner, and I just didn\u2019t want people to feel alone anymore.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the project reflects Rissi\u2019s engagement with a world clearly in need of uplift, with songs of exhortation like \u201cBreathe In\u201d and \u201cRevival,\u201d and of compassion and hope, as in \u201cLittle Black Boy, Little Black Girl.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of Georgia natives, Rissi was born near Pittsburgh and spent her adolescent years in Missouri. Raised in a musical family that loved both country and R&B, she sang in a singing and dancing troupe sponsored by a local television station at 16. She was offered her first publishing and label deals at 19, and in 2007 released the album Rissi Palmer, charting with the singles, \u201cCountry Girl,\u201d \u201cHold On To Me,\u201d and \u201cNo Air.\u201d She followed with a Christmas single, an independently released children\u2019s album, Best Day Ever, and an EP called The Back Porch Sessions.\n\nRissi has performed at The White House, Lincoln Center, and the Grand Ole Opry, has appeared on Oprah & Friends, CNN, the CBS Early Show, and the Tavis Smiley Show. She has shared stages with Taylor Swift, The Eagles, Chris Young, and Charley Crockett, and she has been featured in Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal, People, Parade, Ebony, Newsweek, and The Huffington Post", "otherInfo": "Durham from the Heart is a weekly online performance featuring Durham musicians.

This proved to be career and life-changing for Kim, helping her gain more confidence in her songwriting and singing. Shortly thereafter, Kim began work on tGG's 4th full-length album, \"Set Your Sights.\" Released independently in conjunction with the Chapel Hill/Durham, NC-based boutique label PotLuck Foundation, \"Set Your Sights\" places Kim's heart-on-her-sleeve songwriting and earnest, honest lyrical delivery at the forefront of an atmospheric sonic expedition, led by producer / guitarist Jonny Daly and supported by a long list of players from Atlanta and the southeast. Kim is currently working on songs for a follow-up LP, to be released in 2019.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bill Harley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6024588.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-26", "Genre": "Folk, Stories, Spoken Word", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A two-time Grammy award-winning artist and recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the RI Council for the Humanities, Bill uses song and story to paint a vibrant and hilarious picture of growing up, schooling and family life.

Hailing from Mexico, Joz draws heavily on nineties British garage-rock punctuated by just the right amount of glam, while Yutaka crossed the Pacific from Japan in order to chase his musical dream. Each one brings something distinct, dynamic, and definitive to the fold.\n\nThe singular magic these musicians conjured on their independent debut \"The Kindness of Strangers\" [Listen Loud Records] reached far beyond LA. Their introductory single \u201cDie A Little,\u201d peaked at #42 on the Alternative Radio charts, while Alternative Press touted it among the \u201c29 Songs You Need To Hear...\u201d, and introduced them to fans internationally while they played over 125 shows in 2017. Further acclaim has come from New Noise Magazine, Tattoo.com, and many more.\n\nA shared infinite sense of drive rallies them. \u201cThere\u2019s a really great chemistry,\u201d agrees Joz. \u201cI write the music, Sara writes the melodies and lyrics and Yutaka adds his elements and sonics. As a leader, Sara has a lot of energy and this mystical side to her that you don\u2019t see in other people. It\u2019s very new school.\u201d\n\nCurrently in the middle of recording their follow-up to \"The Kindness of Strangers\" with Alain Johanes (Queens Of The Stone Age, Arctic Monkeys, Jimmy Eat World) producing, the first single, \"Just One Voice\", mixed by Eddie Kramer (Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, Kiss), is a searing and modern tale of revolution through strength in numbers.\n\n\u201cJust One Voice\u201d sees Silent Rival taking cues from high-energy rock predecessors like the Strokes, New York Dolls, or Queens of the Stone Age with lead singer Sara Coda dancing in Karen O\u2019s footsteps, delivering punch-packing vocals and anthem-worthy lyrics.\n\nCoda begins the song \"While you were sleeping in, the world you know has changed\", setting the tone for the entire song. The chorus kicks in doors with a sonic barrage, announcing its' arrival, while Coda puts everyone on notice with \"I\u2019m not the only one you won\u2019t wipe out or destroy. There\u2019s a million, a million, a million I\u2019m just one voice\".\n\n\"As a band, we choose to reject the belief that we\u2019re living in a messed up world. We love this world, despite its faults. We realize that we have to take responsibility for this world that we\u2019ve created, and with that responsibility comes the power to change it. I see people working to change the world for the better every day. This song is for that army of people.\"\n\nJoz adds, \u201cIt\u2019s really cool that this band could bring together people from different backgrounds to create something unique. The fact that we get to travel around together and play shows to fans together, there\u2019s nothing more fulfilling than that.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to sell or push anything,\u201d Sara leaves off. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to tell you what to think, believe, or how to live your life.

Their energetic live set and unique recording process has made fans out of some of the biggest names in music including Pharrell Williams, Questlove, and OutKast. Gaining popularity among such tastemakers led to collaborations with artists like Big Boi, The Gorillaz, and SBTRKT. The release of Little Dragon's fourth album, Nabuma Rubberband, is the culminating moment in their career after years of building a grassroots fanbase.\n\nMusically inspired by the more experimental pockets of Prince's back catalogue, club culture and the vintage Janet Jackson slow jams Yukimi used to listen to wandering around Gothenburg during the unrelenting winter, Nabuma Rubberband has a different feel to previous Little Dragon albums. \"When you put some of Janet's really slow stuff on you feel like you're floating,\" Yukimi explains. \"That feeling really influenced me and maybe that's why there are quite a lot of slow jams on the record. In the past we've been a bit self-conscious about making slow jams after 'Twice'.

The multi-faceted Renaissance man proves it on his upcoming new studio album, aptly titled A Whole Lot More To Me, a record that furthers Morgan's reputation as one of the genre's most commanding vocalists.\n\nWhile his singing on such hits as the multi-week Number One \"That\u2019s What I Love About Sunday,\" \"International Harvester,\" \"Bonfire,\" \"This Ole Boy\" and \"Wake Up Lovin' You\" was exemplary, Morgan has somehow found a new level and vocal range in the studio. On his forthcoming LP, his third with label home Black River Entertainment, he's making the most relevant, authentic and moving music of his career. It's a point that \"When I'm Gone\" drives home, as Morgan sings about living life with no regrets.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a renewed energy with this record,\" he says emphatically. \"In fact, I'm at the pinnacle of my career \u2014 producing, singing and touring. And this song epitomizes that. It's about living to the fullest, and when people hear it, I know they'll relate it to their own lives.\"\n\nHis newest single, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon,\u201d is an epic love song and one of many radio-ready hits on Morgan's highly anticipated project. He's written nearly half of the album's dozen tracks, and makes all of them his own. \"I'm That Country\" exudes Southern charm; \"Remind Me Why I'm Crazy\" showcases Morgan the crooner; \"I Can't Wait to Stay\" exults the joys of a small-town life; and \"A Whole Lot More to Me\" is a musical autobiography. The collection\u2019s \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone,\u201d has already met critical acclaim with Music Row calling it a \u201cpowerhouse performance of a pile-driving song.\u201d Each highlights his artistic renaissance.\n\nMorgan laughs at that word, however: \"artistic.\"\n\n\"I have friends who are very artistic people, sometimes oddly so, and I never wanted to be that guy, to be so artistic that I'm odd,\" he says smiling. \"But it's good to know that I've evolved musically and, with this new record, I've created something with longevity.\"\n\nIndeed, Morgan's A Whole Lot More To Me, co-produced with Byron Gallimore (Tim McGraw, Sugarland, Faith Hill) and released via Black River Entertainment, is a timeless recording. As was their goal, Morgan and Gallimore, with whom he worked for the first time, succeeded in making music that will sound fresh a decade or more from now. These are songs that define a man.\n\nMorgan uses the honesty of the concert stage as an analogy for how he assembled what will be his seventh studio album. \"It would look funny if you went to one of my concerts and I stood out there in skinny jeans. I'm not 21 years old, and I shouldn't pretend to be,\" he says. \"But I also know this music will fit right in on country radio today. I'm singing music that is real and believable and at the same time relatable to all types of fans. That's hard to do, but you can do it if you stay true to who you are.\"\n\nAnd Craig Morgan knows exactly who he is, a man with many sides. Along with being an entertainer, he's an adventure junkie and hosts the popular Outdoor Channel series Craig Morgan: All Access Outdoors, entering its seventh season this summer. He's also a 17-year Army and Army Reserves veteran, a passionate champion of the military, a philanthropist and a celebrated motivational speaker.\n\nHe\u2019s a busy man with a knack for attention to detail. Carefully choosing each lyric on this album is no exception. There is not a single wasted verse \u2014 let alone word \u2014 on the follow-up to 2012's This Ole Boy. \"Every word is valid and relevant on this album,\" he says. \"It's a quality continuation of what I've done in the past.\"\n\nThe most obvious bridge to Morgan's back catalog is the spiritually minded \"Country Side of Heaven.\" The song is inspirational country at its finest, with a soaring chorus that at once elevates both listener and artist.\n\n\"It has a very charismatic, inspirational vibe about it \u2014 but not preachy,\" Morgan says. \"The energy feels spiritual by the time you get to the end and there is an emotional attachment within you that makes you want to hear it again and again.\"\n\nMorgan says the song, as well as album tracks like the emotionally charged \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon\u201d and the empowered-woman tale \"All Cried Out,\" act as a through-line, a path for fans to connect the dots of his career: \"You develop a fan base and they get acquainted with a certain thing from you, and they want that. This album is full of those.\"\n\nAnother standout on the project is \u201cHearts I Leave Behind,\u201d which features Morgan\u2019s gritty and poignant vocals with the soulful Christian rock band Third Day\u2019s lead singer, Mac Powell.\n\nThe hard-touring artist has already been testing out the songs on the road, to stellar results. \"When I'm Gone\" becomes a call to action; \"Country Side of Heaven\" is an audience sing-along; and \"Nowhere Without You,\" written by Michael McDonald, stands as an epic power ballad.\n\n\"It's such an emotional song, one that I can see being played at weddings for a long time,\" he says. \"I feel something in my chest when I hear it. It moves me \u2014 and that's what music is supposed to do.\"\n\nEspecially in the hands of an artist as gifted as Morgan, who can effortlessly toggle between the breezy fun of radio staple \"Redneck Yacht Club\" and the poignancy of \"That's What I Love About Sunday.\" He mixes both approaches in the album's standout track, \"A Whole Lot More to Me.\" A smoldering, jazz-influenced love song with an everyman attitude, it shines a light on a different side of the artist, and country fans in general \u2014 one that likes a fine Cabernet as much as a cold beer, and indulges in sushi by candlelight as regularly as barbecue by the bonfire.\n\n\"As a country singer, we sometimes get stereotyped as nothing but trucks and tailgates, but that doesn't mean that's all there is to us,\" he says, summing up the album. \"I want people to hear this record and go, 'Wow, there is a whole lot more to these country folks.'\"\n\nAnd in Morgan, those folks have no better messenger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bellamy Brothers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618333.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Behrouz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8380357.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-26", "Genre": "Deep House, Desert House, House, Techno", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Very few artists need a proper introduction as their name alone speaks for itself and connotes veteran status.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Scant Regard ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10394228.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-26", "Genre": "Electronic Rock, Alternative, New Wave", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "This is Will Crewdson's solo project.\n\n\u201cA 21st Century Link Wray\u201d John Robb (Louder Than War)\n\n\"He really should know better....but I'm glad he doesn't\" Tom Robinson (BBC 6 Music)\n\nWill Crewdson is Scant Regard.

The fourth generation of JC Stewarts in the family tree \u2013 the rest being grocers \u2013 the young musician was always destined to take a route less travelled.\n\nJC Stewart crafts songs born from his own experiences of love and heartbreak that explode from intimate confessionals into bold anthems. He laughs out loud when asked about the Professional Sadboy nickname that his sister bestowed upon him. It\u2019s a cheeky if appropriate moniker for a man who explores the thrill of romance, the pain of heartache and everything in-between. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal: to have real songs, but also to have a lot of fun with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of my songs start as a small conversation with someone,\u201d he explains, citing influences such as Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, The Band and Hozier. \u201cThen the question is: how do I make it into something bigger that people can connect to, while also keeping it personal?\u201d\n\nThat approach informs his new single \u2018Have You Had Enough Wine?\u2019, which is an autobiographical account of the final conversation he had with an ex-girlfriend. \u201cHave you had enough wine?\u201d he sings. \u201cHave I ruined your life? I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\nThat song is the opening chapter in a narrative arc that charts the last days of that relationship. \u2018Don\u2019t Say You Love Me\u2019 pleads for a clean break to give both parties an escape from their heartbreak, while \u2018I Need You To Hate Me\u2019 is about trying to find closure. As JC notes, \u201cI\u2019d rather she hated me because there\u2019d more of a reason to end it.\u201d\n\nRecent months have seen JC Stewart working with some of the world\u2019s leading producers and writers. The Grammy Award-winner Fred Ball (The Carters) has been a key collaborator, as has Justin Parker, a regular co-writer for Lana Del Rey. Meanwhile, sessions in Los Angeles have included work with Greg Wells (Dua Lipa, Adele), Toby Gad (Jess Glynne, John Legend), Jon Green (Rag N Bone Man, James Bay) and Jonny Coffer (Beyonc\u00e9, Fall Out Boy)\n\nJC is also in-demand as a songwriter. He looks set to have a first bona fide hit in the shape of \u2018Hollywood\u2019, a song which features on the #1 debut album from his friend Lewis Capaldi. He\u2019s been winning over new converts for his own material by joining Freya Ridings on tour \u2013 a double-bill sure to lead the next wave of vital, international-facing British artists.\n\nHaving just launched his own Sunshine Boy sub-brand which he\u2019ll be using to release music and merch, JC has an exciting year ahead with shows with the likes of LAUV, Anne-Marie and Vance Joy, and is also appearing at festivals such as Latitude and Barn On The Farm.", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Noah Aronson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6648981.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-26", "Genre": "Jewish Folk", "Time": "8:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Noah Aronson is a graduate of Berklee College of Music and has been working as a musician for the majority of his professional life.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Todd Alsup ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10294817.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-26", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer, songwriter and keyboardist Todd Alsup makes timeless, soul-filled music with an uplifting groove.

Summer 2013, she flew out to Nashville to write and record her first EP with Keith Follese (Tim McGraw, Martina McBride, Faith Hill), Adrienne Follese, and Liz Rose (Taylor Swift). The EP, \u201cMaybe More,\u201d is the result of taking her personal stories and writing experience and adding in some of the top songwriters and producers in the business.\n\nA few years after creating \u201cMaybe More\u201d and the EP landing multiple nominations for the Hollywood Music and Media Awards and various other competitions, more stars aligned and after several trips back and forth from Nashville and many hours writing and recording, she finished her first full album, which includes the songs off of the \u201cMaybe More\u201d EP as well as seven new songs created with the help of the incredible Jeff Pardo (Lady Antebellum, Matthew West, Colton Dixon). Since its release, the album has received great reviews and has also received numerous award nominations.\n\nCurrently, Bethany is touring around Texas with her first band and showing her art to anyone who will listen.

On Suffer In Peace, the son of a Garden City, Missouri farmer opens his veins and examines the pain that comes from being truly engaged with living.\n\nFrom the wracked hangover of what you don\u2019t see coming in love \u201cWithdrawals,\u201d the smoky acoustic \u201cI Don\u2019t Even Want This Beer\u201d or the spare run-from-the-memories title track, the classically-trained vocalist knows that love isn\u2019t just hard, it\u2019s risky. With a resonant tenor that has a powdery bottom and a warm center, Farr heats up difficult emotions and peels back what most men barricade behind bravado.\n\nOne listen to \u201cA Guy Walks Into A Bar,\u201d Suffer\u2019s lead single, is to hear the tension, the exhaustion and the devastation that comes with a stiff upper lip. It falters just a bit, buckles and throws unspeakable pain wide open without going for melodrama as he transforms the joke into a punchline that is the hero\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cI could sing you heartbreak ballads for over an hour and a half,\u201d laughs the easy-talking Farr. \u201cI have a lot of heartbreak ballads, because I think there\u2019s a lot more heartbreak than happily ever after... But happily ever after is still what keeps you going after it.\u201d\n\nNot that he\u2019s looking to throw an industrial strength pity party. From Craig Wiseman\u2019s thumpin\u2019 \u201cC.O.U.N.T.R.Y.,\u201d the hillbilly word-tumble a la Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cSubterranean Homesick Blues,\u201d straight through to \u201cDamn Good Friends,\u201d which features tour mate and pal Jason Aldean trading verses celebrating good ole boy\u2019s hanging tough, Suffer is also the gusto of cold beer after a hard day\u2019s work, the notion of raising Hell and chasing the night and the grass roots eroticism that happens when you lose the posturing.\n\nFarr evokes old school rednecks, hellions and honky-tonkers like the Hank Jr of Major Moves and 5-0, the John Anderson of \u201cSwingin\u2019\u201d and \u201cLet Somebody Else Drive,\u201d Gary Stewart in his prime and Keith Whitley channeling Lefty Frizzell in \u201cI Never Go Around Mirrors.\u201d Confessing, \u201cI chew tobacco, I don\u2019t smoke. I drink whiskey \u2018cause I like it,\u201d he suggests his vices qualify him straight up and honest.\n\nBut his affinity for hard country and honky-tonk comes from an even more bedrock place: his parents. Following behind his father\u2019s tractor raking the hay on the 150 acres he raised cattle on, Farr was basted in Ronnie Milsap, Conway Twitty\u2019s \u201cShe\u2019s Got A Single Thing In Mind,\u201d Vince Gill\u2019s I Still Believe In You and Sammy Kershaw\u2019s Politics, Religion & Her \u2013 and his Mom, an aspiring singer who loved Dan Seals\u2019 \u201cBop,\u201d ended up married to George Jones touring guitarist, which pulled Farr right up to the bumper of one of country\u2019s greatest raw lightning vocalists, as well as being exposed to Merle Haggard, Vern Gosdin, and Gene Watson.\n\nHe also found his own way to the party. \u201cCarol, our bus driver, smoked Marlboro Reds while she was driving \u2018cause that\u2019s how we do... and I\u2019d go to the back of the bus where there was this older girl who was just built, and who had a boom box she\u2019d play Tim McGraw\u2019s Not A Moment Too Soon on, and that was pretty good for a young high school kid.\u201d\n\nFarr\u2019s way was paved with the prestigious OAKE National Choir and years of formal voice training. But the high road didn\u2019t appeal. At 21, like so many hard-scrabble dreamers, he made his way to Nashville to try his hand at being a star.\n\n\u201cI saw guys who\u2019d been there for ten years and nothing had happened,\u201d Farr said of the sobering reality. \u201cI got there, thinking I\u2019ve got an album... I\u2019m gonna be a star. It cost me $25,000. It was a total mess.\n\u201cYou start to realize: it doesn\u2019t matter how good, or what you\u2019ve got. There\u2019s just so much more to it.\u201d\n\nFarr didn\u2019t know, beyond what he\u2019d picked up from his stepfather. But he was determined. \u201cI got a job at Tootsies, first day passing out flyers. I was a bar back. I\u2019d pull sets playing for tips when they\u2019d let me... and I swear that was the best hamburger in the South!\u201d\n\nIn true country boy can survive spirit, while Farr was waiting on his shot, he did what was necessary. Physical labor, parking cars, short order cooking, landscaping, singing demos, construction work, recreational therapist, working in a halfway house for children, \u201cwhich was rough; we\u2019d find suicide notes in tissue boxes, razor blades hidden under chair cushions.\u201d\n\nAnd he kept pulling sets at Tootsies, playing for tips. \u201cFour, five sets a night. People loved it. That\u2019s where I really honed in on what I wanted to do \u2013 playing covers, classic country, ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd and trying to write songs.\n\n\u201cWe figured out how to get out of town, too. Whiskey River in Valdosta, Georgia, Rumors in Atlanta, all over Florida and the Southeast. I\u2019d play Tootsies three, four nights a week, then take off on weekends.\u201d\n\nPunching it out on the streets and in the honky-tonks. It\u2019s where the survivors and the-won\u2019t-go-homers refuse to die. Every now and then a kid with talent rises from the herd.\n\nFate stepped in. Country-rapper Colt Ford was looking for a background singer. Farr was looking to make it happen for himself. \u201cColt called me personally; he said, \u2018I know you\u2019re trying to make it. Take the job. I\u2019ll let you open for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust as importantly, the gig opened doors and Farr\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cI learned a whole lot that year out on the road, singing \u2018Dirt Road Anthem\u2019 before Jason (Aldean) ever cut it. Dreaming every damn night, learning the ropes.\u201d\n\nAs time passed, Farr met Stephanie Cox, his publisher, \u201cand someone who believed in me enough that I didn\u2019t give up when other people might have.\u201d Jim Catino, now his producer, took the roughneck with the golden pipes to RCA Nashville. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what it was, but they thought I had something. Beyond being real, I think it made me a mystery.\u201d\n\nThey signed the hard singing songwriter with the nuance in his midrange.\n\nIf he wasn\u2019t like all the other kids, he was an awful lot like the fans, the working people who turn out for country shows. With little fan fare, Redneck Crazy was a #2 Billboard Country Album debut and an even more impressive Top 5 Billboard Top 200 Album debut, en route to yielding a pair of #1 hits in the title track and \u201cWhiskey In My Water.\u201d\n\nBut Farr was just getting started. He toured incessantly: Florida Georgia Line, Luke Bryan, Lee Brice, Jason Aldean, festivals, dive bars. A working class country singer, he was trying to get people to hear his songs. Ultimately his debut sold well over six figures, but more importantly, the time staring the fans in the face solidified his take on what he wanted his kind of country to be.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think real life is flowers and sunshine \u2013 and I didn\u2019t have a white picket fence in front of a little house,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy parents split up. My Mom was married four times, so I\u2019m used to people leaving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot... but so have most people. And I want to be honest. I\u2019d be lying if I made a record that\u2019s all girls and love and perfect \u2018cause that\u2019s not real. I\u2019d be lying to myself and to the people who look for their life in these songs...\n\n\u201cI wrote more songs on my first album, but in the end, while I had plenty of songs written, people made much better songs available to us. Songs that said what I wanted to say... that maybe said it better. And some of my songs I know are hits, but I want an album when you put the songs together, it fits. To me, Suffer does.\u201d\n\nCertainly there are emergent themes. Pride in who we are charges \u201cWhy We Live Here,\u201d \u201cDamn Good Friends,\u201d \u201cC.O.U.N.T.R.Y.\u201d and \u201cRaised To Pray,\u201d while the notion of addiction being the reality when facing love gone bad or just plain gone offers a metaphor to harbor \u201cWithdrawals,\u201d \u201cI Don\u2019t Even Want This Beer,\u201d \u201cSuffer In Peace\u201d and \u201cA Guy Walks Into a Bar.\u201d\n\nIt is the good; it is the bad. Mostly, it is the real.\n\n\u201cI think most of us are fighting the good and the evil sides of who we are. I\u2019m a good person, but I genuinely like people. You get out having fun, one thing leads to another, you flirt with that line and it can get real thin.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the truth about life. There\u2019s always that other side, and it\u2019s not black and white. It\u2019s not that easy. I\u2019m a simple person, but inside, I might be complicated.\u201d\n\nFarr voices trails off. Like he said, it\u2019s not that easy, but the things that endure never are. Not slick, not fast, not obvious, he harkens back to a time when country singers raised hell and went to church, worked hard and played harder. They fell in love, but faced profound grief when it fell apart \u2013 and maintained their dignity no matter what.\n\n\u201cIf Suffer In Peace does anything, I hope for people who don\u2019t have perfect lives, they can go, \u2018Hell, yes!\u2019 Because life is messy and hard to trust sometimes, but it\u2019s deep and it\u2019s intense \u2013 and if you do it right, you get to experience it all.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/foldsofhonortn"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "David Starr Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9239733.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Americana artist David Starr possesses \u201ca compelling voice, something truly special, both accessible and passionate\u201d (Elmore), that has been honed releasing nine albums, touring internationally, and opening shows for esteemed artists such as John Oates, Travis Tritt, Clint Black, Karla Bonoff, The Steel Wheels, Restless Heart, Survivor, John McEuen, The Guess Who, and more.

Let me turn the corner and be home. I'm tired of being on this road alone.\" Real lyrics are what Channing Wilson is all about.\nFrom a small town in Northwest Georgia Channing learned about real life American good times and hardships. He's not afraid to tell you about it either. From his songs like \"Poor Man's Cocaine\" referring to methamphetamines taking over rural America, to songs like \"Crazy Over You\" which is a throwback love song to the era of Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, Channing's voice along with his lyrics stand alone in a time of mass produced \"throwaway\" singers and songwriters.\nBrought up on the real side of the tracks by two hard working \"dirt collar\" parents, he had plenty of opportunities to learn real life at an early age. Channing says \"I didn't have a musical family. My mother is a pretty good singer, but an even better worker. So, I found music later than most artists.\" Finding music later for Channing didn't slow down his passion for it. Learning guitar at 17 and starting writing shortly after. \"I came across a book of short poems my mother had written before I was born, and after reading them I was so inspired to explore my creative side.\"\nBy 25 he had flunked out of college and quit more jobs than he applied for. \"I never could accept the idea that I was supposed to work every day for someone else. I expected more than a paycheck. After a friend turned me on to Guy Clark and Steve Earle, I knew 2 things. I never wanted to punch a clock again, and I had to become a better writer and musician.\" Thats exactly what he did at 26 years old, he started his first band and quickly learned the ropes as a very successful regional act. That venture lasted 6 years until he became a father and knew he had to step up his game if he was going to turn a dream into a way of life.\nSelling a fishing boat and a decent guitar collection to finance trips from north Georgia to Nashville every week paid off in October of 2010 he was approached by EMI Music Publishing after playing a Tuesday night showcase called Alabama Line. After meeting with EMI a few times he was offered his first publishing deal. \"I didn't know what I had to offer such a big corporate publishing company, but when I looked on the roster and seen Guy Clark I knew I was in.\" It didn't take long before he was in the room with his teacher. Learning from the master himself. \"Just knowing Guy has made me a better man, but getting to share ideas and stories is a dream come true.\"\nChanning got his first cut with a song titled \"Living With The Blues.\" Sony recording artist Tyler Farr cut the song the same way he heard the demo. Acoustic and raw. He even played the guitar track on the upcoming album. He has been writing with some of Nashville's best writers such as Guy Clark, Ashley Monroe, Drake White, Dave Kennedy and more. All the while pursuing artist acknowledgment. When asked if he wanted to be an artist he replied \"If you can't tell I'm an artist by listening to my songs, you're not listening.\"\nHe has shared bills with so many of his heroes such as Billy Joe Shaver, Steve Earle, Robert Earl Keen, Tony Joe White, Chris Knight, Dale Watson, and many more including getting invited to be on the 2012 Country Throwdown Tour.\nChanning's love for country music history and future of country music is second to none. \"I came to Nashville to make a difference, and I'll always work hard to earn respect from my peers. I owe them that at least. Hell, I've played their songs so many times for free.\"\n\nwww.channingwilson.com\nwww.twitter.com/channingwilson\nwww.facebook.com/channingwilson", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2777831562503359"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Caylee Hammack ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9454416.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Ellaville, Georgia", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Over the past 13 years, Caylee Hammack has been paying her dues in smoky bars, opry houses, and music festivals around the United States.

It was a hard time to not be inspired. Anchored by southern storytelling and swampy,country-soul swagger,Shine On Rainy Day had become a critical and commercial hit, earning Cobb a long string of shows with artistslike Chris Stapleton and Margo Price. He embraced the road-warrior lifestyle, picking up ideas for new songs every time his band hit the highway.\n\nSomewhere between the whirl of shows, hotels, and truck stops, Providence Canyon began taking shape. During breaks in the band\u2019s schedule, Cobb would return to Nashville\u2014his hometown for a decade, ever since he left his childhood stomping grounds of rural Georgia\u2014and head over to RCA Studio A. There, in an historic studio run by his cousin, producer Dave Cobb, he brewed up a sound that nodded to his previous material while still pushing forward. The songs were faster. More upbeat. More personal, too. Together, they formed his sophomore album, 2018\u2019s Providence Canyon.\n\nNamed after a Georgian gully that Cobb often visited as a teenager, Providence Canyon is an evocative, electrified album about a life lived on the run. There are road songs, half-lit drinking tunes, tributes to friends and family, and nostalgic nods to one\u2019s younger years. There are songs about returning home and songs about getting the hell out of dodge. Gluing everything together is the unforced country croon and sharp songwriting of Brent Cobb, who credits his recent touring history for inspiring the album\u2019s quicker pace.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the funkier side of country and the funkier side of rock,\u201d he explains. \u201cThose influences have been a part of me for years, but they\u2019re really coming to the forefront now. When you\u2019re touring with Chris Stapleton, and you\u2019re performing to a crowd of 10,000 people before he hits the stage, you find yourself wanting to play something upbeat.\u201d\n\nIf Shine On Rainy Day felt like a laidback country album for front-porch picking sessions, then Providence Canyon is built for something bigger. This is music for juke joints, pool halls, and roadhouses, filled with electric guitar (performed by Cobb\u2019s touring bandmate, Mike Harris), B3 organ, percussive groove, and co-ed harmonies. And while the album\u2019s recording sessions were spread out across an entire year, each song was captured in a small number of takes, with Brent and Dave Cobb relying on instinct and spur-of-the-moment ideas. The two cousins may have grown up on opposite sides of Georgia, but they share similar backgrounds and musical instincts\u2014two qualities that lend an earthy authenticity to these 11 songs of the south.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the blood,\u201d Brent says of his connection to his cousin\u2014 who, in addition to producing Shine on Rainy Day, has also overseen award-winning records for Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, and Chris Stapleton. \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up together,but we\u2019re so similar in our approaches. It\u2019s important to me to do this with him, because these songs are about the places I\u2019m from, the places I\u2019ve visited, and the people who\u2019ve taken me there. My family is all over these songs.\u201d\n\nSongs like \u201cLoreen\u201d and \u201cCome Home Soon\u201d were partially inspired by Cobb\u2019s daughter, while \u201cKing of Alabama\u201d was written in honor of a close family friend, songwriter Wayne Mills, who passed away in 2013. \u201cI keep his chain in my pocket, his son in my prayers / Every stage I\u2019m on, I can feel him there,\u201d Cobb sings during the latter song, which pays tribute not only to Mills\u2019 life, but also to the struggle of roadbound musicians everywhere. During the final chorus, Cobb promises to honor Mills\u2019 legacy by doing the very thing Mills did best: creating real, raw music. He urges his audience to do the same. \u201cHonky-tonk\u2019s the trick,\u201d he sings. \u201cGet a guitar and grab a pick / Let the old tunes possess you, and play.\u201d\n\nOn the drawling, guitar-driven \u201cMornin\u2019s Gonna Come\u201d and \u201cSucker for a Good Time,\u201d Cobb battles against the temptations of the road, where the drinks are free and the nights are long. He doubles down on his commitment to his wife and daughter with \u201cAin\u2019t a Road Too Long,\u201d whose mix of Bible Belt boogie-woogie and Southern rock channels influences like the Band. Then, on the album\u2019s breezy title track, he casts his mind back to his teenage years, when a trip to Providence Canyon\u2014a 150-feet gorge in the sandy clay of southwest Georgia, less than an hour\u2019s drive from Cobb\u2019s hometown\u2014was enough to remind him of life\u2019s fleeting, precious nature. \u201cThe night won\u2019t last forever, after all,\u201d he sings during the song\u2019s chorus, while pedal steel and acoustic guitars chime in the background.\n\nTechnically one of the oldest songs in Brent Cobb\u2019s catalog, \u201cProvidence Canyon\u201d (like the album that borrows its name) glorifies the thrill of hitting the open road, while also pining for the comfort and safety of home. Those themes permeate the album. For Cobb\u2014a longtime touring musician who\u2019d already logged years on the road before Shine on Rainy Day\u2019s success\u2014there\u2019s never been a better time to explore the interlocking worlds of family, work, home, the highway, and wanderlust. Providence Canyon is the soundtrack to that journey.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know the definition of \u2018providence,\u2019\u201d he admits. \u201cI looked it up in my early 20s, and the definition is something like \u2018the protective power of God\u2014or nature\u2014as a spiritual power.\u2019 When I read that, it inspired the whole song. I was 23 at the time, and I missed the old days and the freedom of youth. Years later, I still try to keep my music honest and somehow sacred, which is why Providence Canyon felt like the appropriate title for this collection of songs. Maybe it\u2019s got something to do with the recurring feeling of me wanting to get home all the time, even while I\u2019m enjoying my shows more than ever. Maybe home is a providence canyon in itself.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2777831562503359"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sarah Blacker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9345774.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Jamband, Pop-indie-folk-rock, Rock, Americana, Jambands, Americana & Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The music of award-winning multi-instrumentalists / songwriters, Sarah Blacker & Aaron Z.

With its spellbinding intensity, \u201cJealousy\u201d unfolds in a masterfully orchestrated sound that merges soaring harmonies and kinetic beats, symphonic strings and scorching guitar work. And on \u201cHustlin\u2019,\u201d cascading piano tones and gently lilting rhythms build a beautiful contrast to the song\u2019s moody meditation on perseverance and grit. Along with completing the follow-up to Healing Tide, The War And Treaty spent much of 2019 touring with the likes of Brandi Carlile and Jason Isbell, as well as joining the legendary Al Green for a run of dates at such iconic venues as Radio City Music Hall.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2777831562503359"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Amy Grant ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6984252.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Gospel, Christian-gospel, Singer-songwriter, Rock, Pop, Christian, Christian/gospel", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Amy Grant (born November 25, 1960) is an American Christian and pop singer-songwriter and has done some television.\n\nGrant made her debut in 1977 under the guidance of Myrrh Records, and became the first Christian recording act to have an album be certified platinum. Following her marriage to Gary Chapman in 1982 and a subsequent deal between her record company and A&M Records, a series of successful pop-crossover records consolidated her position as both Christian music's highest-selling act and a formidable force in mainstream music, and according to Billboard magazine she was the most successful Christian recording artist of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\n\nAfter giving birth to her fourth child Corinna Grant Gill, Grant returned to her gospel music roots with the 2002 release of Legacy...Hymns & Faith. The album featured a Vince Gill-influenced mix of bluegrass and gospel and marked Grant's 25th anniversary in the music industry. Grant followed this up with the pop release Simple Things in 2003. The album did not see the success of her previous pop efforts, and soon after the album, Amy and Interscope/A&M parted ways.\n\nGrant released a sequel to her hymns collection in 2005 titled Rock of Ages... Hymns & Faith. Despite publicly musing that life would be easier if she weren't working, Grant joined the reality television phenomenon by hosting Three Wishes, a show in which she and a team of helpers make wishes come true for small-town residents. The show debuted on NBC in the fall of 2005, but was cancelled in November after 10 episodes. After Three Wishes was cancelled, Grant won her 6th Grammy Award for Rock of Ages.\n\nIn a February, 2006 webchat, Amy stated she believes her \"best music is still ahead\".\n\nAmy Grant recorded a live cd/dvd album in early 2006 and it was released later in the year.\n\nTo date Amy Grant has sold more than 25 million records worldwide and is a 6 time Grammy winning artist.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2777831562503359"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jontavious  Willis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9010092.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2777831562503359"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Julian Taylor ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Scenes Live Sessions Livestream: https://www.facebook.com/scenesmedia"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Berry ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8626625.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The last three years have been big for John Berry, seeing him release three new albums as well as being diagnosed with throat cancer in January 2019 and being declared cancer-free in May of 2019. The singer-songwriter rose to stardom on the country charts of the 1990s with such mega hits as Your Love Amazes Me, Standing on the Edge of Goodbye and She\u2019s Taken a Shine. His annual Christmas tour, entering its 23'rd year, brightens the holidays for thousands, as does his electrifying rendition of O\u2019 Holy Night.\n\nDuring the 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, John placed 20 singles on the county charts, 6 of which went Top 5, with Your Love Amazes Me, scoring a #1 on the Billboard and Radio & Records Country Chart as well as Standing on the Edge of Goodbye and She\u2019s Taken a Shine earning the #1 slot in Radio & Records. He has earned multiple Gold and Platinum records over the years. John was nominated for the ACM Top New Male Vocalist in 1994, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for his participation in Amazing Grace: A Country Salute to Gospel Vol. 1, was nominated for another Grammy in 1995 for his smash hit Your Love Amazes Me and was nominated for the CMA Horizon Award and Top Male Vocalist Award in 1995. In 1997 he was nominated for Vocal Event of the Year (for Long Haired Country Boy with Charlie Daniels and Hal Ketchum) and in 2013 John was nominated for the Mainstream Country Male Artist by the ICM Awards. And thanks to the miracles of modern technology, he even sang a duet with the late, great Patsy Cline.\n\u201cI love what I do, with a passion not seen in quite some time. I\u2019m hopeful and excited about the future. I love singing and always will. I have a bus, an incredible stage presentation, a great band, hands-on management team and I\u2019m always all dressed up and ready to go.\u201d\nHe and his family moved back to Music City after several years in Georgia, and 2017 saw John pursuing a touring and personal appearance schedule that is more active than ever. Given his wide range of music and number of releases, John is fortunate in that he can book a solo show with just himself and guitar, a small-band acoustic show or a full-band engagement and has more than enough hit material to captivate a crowd and deliver an evening full of musical memories.\nJohn\u2019s enduringly powerful performances draw on a lifetime of making music and living life. Born in South Carolina and raised in Georgia, he began playing guitar at 13, performing shows at age 14 and making records at age 19. \u201cBy the time I was 17, I knew that music was what I wanted to do with my life\u201d; and he has done it well ever since.\nBetween 1979 and 1990 he recorded and marketed six albums on his own labels. The Graduation Song, which he wrote during his senior year in high school, became a perennial favorite at graduation ceremonies. It appeared on two of his early collections.\n\nThose early discs and John\u2019s strong regional popularity attracted attention on Music Row. Capitol Records signed him to his first major label contract in 1992. Berry\u2019s co-written hits A Mind of Her Own and Kiss Me in the Car introduced him to radio audiences in 1993. Then Your Love Amazes Me, What\u2019s in it for Me and You and Only You thrust him to stardom in 1994. Standing on the Edge of Goodbye, I Think About it all the Time, and If I Had Any Pride Left at All were all major hits the following year, with Standing on the Edge of Goodbye earning John the coveted 1995 Grammy nomination.\n\nBut it was his stunning performance of the title track of the 1995 CD O\u2019 Holy Night that led to his most enduring legacy to date. John began doing special Christmas tours that year and 2016 marks his 20th anniversary holiday concert tour. He has big plans to celebrate and involve the fans like never before for this anniversary celebration. He has also issued three more Christmas-music collections. If O\u2019 Holy Night is all that anyone remembers of me, that\u2019s fine with me,\u201d he comments about his perennial Christmas popularity. \u201cIt is a truly inspired piece of music.\u201d\n\nHappily, there were more successes to come. The hit Change My Mind earned John a Top-5 spot on the Country music charts in 1996. She\u2019s Taken a Shine became an even bigger hit in 1997. Both fans and the media took note again when There He Goes was released as a 1999 duet with Patsy Cline.\n\nIn 2002, Berry returned to making records for his own company, Clear Sky Records. Songs and Stories, a double CD was issued that year.\nIn 2003, John Berry released his I Give My Heart collection and its critically applauded wedding anthem Will You Marry Me. The disc also contained his versions of such classic love songs as Time in a Bottle, If, Love Look What You\u2019ve Done to Me, Faithfully, Lady and Let\u2019s Stay Together. I Give My Heart inspired still another popular concert series, The Love Tour.\n\nIn 2008, Those Were the Days, was released, marking John\u2019s return to mainstream country music. He created his first Christian-music CD in 2011. In 2012, John published the combination book and CD, again titled Songs and Stories. Over the years he has continued to tour steadily. \u201cWe just have a great group of fans who welcome us every year. They are always there.\u201d\n\nIn late 2015 John launched a crowd funded Kickstarter project that proved very successful. Overwhelmed by the fan response, John assembled an all-star studio team and cut both a Country album entitled What I Love the Most and a new album simply titled Christmas and released both in late 2016. Blessed with the ability to make the music he wanted to make (and not what a label dictated) allowed John the time to write and create what many music critics who have heard bits & pieces are saying could be his best, most complete project yet. \u201cI'm excited to have been able to release this new music and bring it to the fans through a new distribution agreement with Sony RED. It\u2019s a new time in the music business and technology allows me to be closer to my fans and interact in new ways. You know, God just keeps blessing me. There are new opportunities coming at every turn.\u201d\n\u201cWith time, I\u2019ve learned that the road to fulfillment is doing what I was called to do, love to do, and then doing it the best I can, regardless of the circumstances. And for me, that is making music and singing for people.\"\n\n2017 had John touring in several configurations (acoustic solo, acoustic trio and full band) as well as presenting his legendary Christmas Tour, marking its 21st year this year.\n\nAlso, in August of 2017 John launched a new, weekly internationally syndicated television show entitled Songs and Stories with John Berry that explored the songs and stories that changed the lives of his weekly guest. Superstar guests in Season 1 of the show include Billy Ray Cyrus, Billy Dean, Mo Pitney, Neal McCoy, Suzy Bogguss, Collin Raye, Craig Morgan, Mark Wills, Delbert McClinton, Clay Walker and Lee Roy Parnell.\n\nSongs and Stories with John Berry airs multiple times weekly to over 105 million homes across the United States as well as the UK and New Zealand on great networks like Heartland Television, The Family Channel, The Country Channel, ROKU, Phil Mack\u2019s Keep it Country (UK), Country TV (New Zealand) and Ride TV.\n\n2019 has John touring the country in all performance sectors along with a few surprises.\n\nStay tuned to all of his activities at www.johnberry.com", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2777831562503359"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Michelle Malone ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9117156.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Southern Rock, Alternative Bluesrock, Rock, Alternative Rock, Blues, Folk Acoustic Rock, Americana & Rock, Empowering Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "SHORT BIO:\n\n\"Pure, unfiltered Georgia soul lined at the edges with bluesy Americana and primal rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2026Wait until you hear Slings & Arrows, music fans.

It\u2019s just a great album; one that also happens to do do those things. It's Outrageously good. While the vocals and songs on Slings and Arrows are outstanding, the slide guitar work is the real revelation. \u201d NO DEPRESSION\n\nABOUT MICHELLE MALONE\n\nMichelle Malone is an award-winning American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer in the rock, folk, blues and pop idioms. She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins. Michelle's latest recording, Slings and Arrows, was released March 2018 and debuted at #8 on the Billboard Blues charts.\n\nFor tour dates, info and booking or, please visit www.michellemalone.com/contact", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2777831562503359"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Rad Trads ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10358944.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Michael Fatum - Trumpet, Vocals, Alden Harris-McCoy - Guitar, Vocals, Big Red Mike Harlen - Bass, Vocals, Patrick Sargent - Saxophones Vocals, Jamie Donald Eblen - Drums, Vocals", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Brooklyn-based five-piece The Rad Trads are known for their eclectic take on rock n\u2019 roll, which mixes punk rock energy, horn drenched soul, and precise musicianship with a lighthearted but sincere delivery. It\u2019s a sound and approach that has come sharply into focus on the band\u2019s latest release, 99 in October, out now on Wombat Squad Records.\n\nThe band recorded the EP while touring in support of their sophomore release On Tap \u2014 a world tour which totaled over 80,000 miles and included shows in support of Lake Street Dive, Dr. Dog, Modest Mouse, BAILEN, and The Motet, with dates in Asia, Europe, and across the USA. Along the way, they began writing and performing new material, and the folkiness of their last release began to morph into the hard-edged, anthemic, and frequently poppy sound of 99 In October.\n\n\u201cThe indie influence was definitely starting to emerge in On Tap,\u201d mused saxophonist/keyboardist/vocalist Patrick Sargent. \u201cWe were rooted in this Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, Bob Dylan, bluesy folk-rock thing, but bands like Wilco and Spoon were sort of whispering in our ears - In fact, we were once hilariously described as \u2018Wilco at the circus.\u2019 99 In October marks the moment where we fully modernized our sound, but it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve left our previous selves entirely behind. Maybe it\u2019s because horns are the centerpiece of our instrumentation, but it\u2019s always been more of a \u2018yes and\u2019 kind of a thing, where instead of choosing between \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018retro\u2019 we\u2019ve just thrown it all together. If Rivers Cuomo hired Sam Buttera from the Louis Prima band to record a saxophone solo, it might sound something like the ending of \u201899 in October.\u2019 Or if Courtney Barnett collaborated with the Hi Records horns, they\u2019d come up with \u2018Spanish Radio.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother key factor in the band\u2019s evolution is producer Chris Peck, who mixed On Tap and handled both production and mixing duties on 99 in October. \u201cChris\u2019s sonic palette is very contemporary, and when he shared the On Tap mixes, everyone\u2019s ears perked up. So with \u201899 In October\u2019 we fully leaned in,\u201d said guitarist Alden Harris McCoy.\n\nAt times, Peck\u2019s role became almost like an invisible 6th member of the band. On \u201cShouldn\u2019t Have To Ask Me Why\u201d he ran the song's bluesy guitar riff through a Roland Space Echo, sending the sound into the echo chamber and back out again in real-time as Harris McCoy played next to him. The final result was described by Bandcamp as \u201ca tense & coiled bit of brass-ornamented rock that snaps & lunges without warning.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Go Walking in the Moonlight\u201d was infused with reverb-laden falsetto harmonies and chiming piano, lending an unexpected backdrop to a song that\u2019s eager to unseat \u201cMoondance\u201d as the first dance at your cousin\u2019s wedding. Peck also encouraged the band to take big risks, like taking \u201cThe Good Stuff\u201d from an up-tempo party anthem straight out of the Springsteen playbook and turning it into a meditative campfire sing along. The resulting rendition became the band\u2019s acoustic encore and a moment of intimate connection that fans fondly reminisced about on social media upon the song\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the fact that we started as a bar band and are used to playing three hours a night, but we\u2019ve never really settled into one lane, or felt like we should,\u201d bassist Michael Harlen added. \u201cBetween that and being a five-way collaboration where we all write and sing lead, it only feels right to explore everything that interests us, without bending to the close-minded rigidness of genre. This EP feels like a real step forward for us, where we took a lot of risks and wound up with something original and thrilling. It has us all very excited about what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Rad Trads are the pizza of bands. You\u2019re always in the mood for it,\u201d\n- Rachael Price (Lake Street Dive)\n\n\u201cTheir live performances can turn into a Saturday night church meeting, fueled by the fact that all five of them can sing.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion. Now, 2016 finds him writing, touring, and releasing new material, with his sights set on expanding well beyond the two cities of his origin.

Bios kinda suck. I've been doing these things for so long now, that I feel like just when I have written the mother of all things informative and maybe funny, I go and record a new record. Why does shit always have to evolve and the information change every time another year goes by? Why, since the last bio (which I felt was an understated masterpiece) did I have to go and do shit to deem it necessary for an update? Just because between the last album, \"I Liked it Better When You Had No Heart\" and now, I have: shot a video for \"Pretty Melody\" from the album ILIBWYHNH, wore a tv on my head in it and fought ninjas, got it featured on YouTube and it got a half million views, did a sold out headlining tour of the states last year, supported Train on a sold out tour of the states, then went and supported Pink on a sold out stadium tour of Europe all summer, including sold out headlining club shows of our own over there. Hmmm... What else.. Oh! Taylor Swift heard a little version I did of her song, \"I Liked it Better When You Belonged With Me\" (or was it \"You Belong With Me\"? I can't freaking remember...). She called me and asked if she could play my version of it on the Grammys and would I mind playing along side her and Stevie Nicks for the performance. Then she fell in love with me and ran away to Barcelona to elope, only to find out that while I was in the bathroom at the airport, she fell in love with Jake Gylenhall (sp?), who stole my fucking seat next to her in the waiting terminal.... Ok... I made that last part up. Fun right? No? Ok.. Like the fans are always telling me, don't talk about politics, religious views or Tay Tay Swift.\n\nI should mention the band i play in. Just like the last record, this record was recorded, written and produced by me and the Black Widows. It consist of my longtime bandmates, Chris Unck on guitar, lap and pedal steel. He's a redneck from the north Georgia mountains who I think wrestled alligators at one time, and built lighthouses. He also fronted Chris Unck and the Black Roses.. Until I stole him. Fran Capitanelli on lead guitar is also a friend of mine that resided in Atlanta during my tenure there, and he played guitar and sang lead in a band I loved called The Tom Collins. Until I stole him. He is the Professor of Energy.... Ask him to explain. Jake Sinclair on bass is not only the tallest, skinniest bassist I know, but he's also the best. He's even better than me, and I'm fucking awesome. I met Jake while producing a record for his band The Films.... Until I stole him. I bartered with him though. I told him he could also engineer the records I make in my studio with me (he's also the best engineer I know) and that his singer/songwriter in the Films, Mike Trent, would have to join in on the Black Widows writing process. I kinda made out good on this whole deal, because Mike is one of the most unsung singer/songwriters I know, and the lyrical collaborations we have done on the last couple of records have been my favorites. Oh yeah, Mike's wife (Cary Ann Hearst) is also an amazing singer/songwriter that I produced a record for last year.... She sang backup vocals on the new Widows record. It's a family affair...\n\nso this is the part of the bio where I'm supposed to describe the new record by us called \"The Spade\". I'm supposed to inject words about the songs like \"soaring\", \"pounding\", \"climactic\", and maybe even a \"unrivaled\"...... But I just can't talk like that about my own music. But what I can say is, just like my bass paying skills..... It's fucking awesome. we will be on the road this year a lot, and probably sleeping at many KOA campgrounds this fall. More than likely, you are reading this because you don't know shit about me and you are about to interview me for your school paper or local radio station visit (yes, im in the lobby) and you need to find out a few things about me to talk about. It's ok. I'm not mad. I'm not very popular and I don't blame you if you \"just aren't into the music\". You may not have read this far, or been able to get past the bass playing part, but if you have, then I commend you.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ryan Cassata ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9113821.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Punk, Indie Rock, Country Blues, Pop, Rock, Hip Hop, Alt-country, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ryan Cassata is an award winning singer-songwriter, actor, performer, writer, LGBTQ activist & motivational speaker based in Los Angeles.

Frontman. Behind-the-scenes songwriter. For more than a decade, Adam Hood has left his mark both onstage and in the writing room, carving out a southern sound that mixes equal parts country, soul and American roots music.\n\nIt's a sound that began shape in Opelika, Alabama. Raised by working-class parents, Hood started playing hometown shows as a 16 year-old, landing a weekly residency at a local restaurant. He'd perform there every Friday and Saturday night, filling his set list with songs by John Hiatt, Hank Williams Jr, and Vince Gill. As the years progressed, the gigs continued \u2014 not only in his home state, but across the entire country. Eventually even landing himself a three-year nationwide tour opening for Leon Russell.\n\nThese days, though, Hood is no longer just putting his own stamp on the songs of chart-topping country stars. Instead, many of those acts -- including Little Big Town, Miranda Lambert, Anderson East, Josh Abbott Band, Lee Ann Womack & Brent Cobb -- are playing his songs.\n\nIn 2016, Hood signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Nashville and GRAMMY Award-winning producer Dave Cobb\u2019s Low Country Sound. All while remaining adamantly focused on his own career, playing around 100 shows annually promoting third solo release, Welcome to the Big World, and now his newest release, Somewhere in Between.\n\nA showcase for both his frontman abilities and songwriting chops, Somewhere in Between shines a light on Hood's strength as a live performer. He recorded most of the album live at Nashville's Sound Emporium Studios over two quick days. Teaming up with friend and producer Oran Thornton (Miranda Lambert's Revolution, Angaleena Presley's Wrangled) their goal was to create something that reflected the raw, real sound of his concerts, where overdubs and unlimited takes are never an option. The result is a record that reflects Hood's working-class roots, mixing the upbeat thrill of his roadhouse roots-rock songs with the contemplative, stripped-down sway of his country ballads.\n\nJoining him in the studio were guitarist Pat McLaughlin, bassist Lex Price, and drummer Jerry Roe. All of whom captured their parts in just a handful of live takes while Hood simultaneously tracked his vocals. Stripped free of studio trickery and lushly layered arrangements, Somewhere in Between is an honest, story-driven record. One that\u2019s both relatable and deeply autobiographical, with Hood writing or co-writing ten of the record\u2019s eleven tracks, alongside friends like McLaughlin, Brent Cobb -- who also appears on the electrified \"She Don't Love Me\" -- Josh Abbott, Jason Eady, and plenty of others.\n\nSomewhere in Between is an album that finally finds Hood telling his own story. A dedicated family man, he wrote \"Locomotive\" \u2014 a heartland anthem, full of Telecaster twang and sunny swagger \u2014 after watching his young daughter develop her motor skills while playing with a set of blocks. Balancing his life as a relentless road-warrior, Hood penned highway ballad \"Downturn\" about a life filled with wanderlust and long drives from gig to gig.\n\nAs a blue-collar songwriter, Hood shines a light on everyday experiences \u2014 from family and friends to the thrill of Friday nights. Partly because he\u2019s stuck to his roots. The native Alabaman still lives in the Yellowhammer State and celebrates America's rural pockets with songs like \"Keeping Me Here\" and \"Real Small Town,\" two songs filled with images of main streets, open landscapes, hard times, and good people.\n\n\"It's southern music,\" he says, grouping Somewhere in Between\u2019s wide range of music under an appropriate banner. \"That's what it represents: the soulful side of southern music, the country side of southern music, the genuineness of southern culture, and the way I grew up. One of the t-shirts I sell at every show simply says \u2018Southern Songs,\u2019 and It's a good summary of what I do. It's what I've always done.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2777831562503359"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Phoebe Bridgers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8979361.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Yesterday, Tomorrow.\"\n\nThe house is exactly what you\u2019d expect: practically a studio apartment except it stands on its own, draped in honeysuckle and Dutchman\u2019s pipe; a yard of dune sedge and stone. Her dog is buried in the garden along the eastern wall; sometimes, she wonders if the ground will bloom half-a-dozen of him under a certain kind of moon. In the morning the light creeps sideways through the windows and lights her up from the chest down, her head nestled in the shadow. Sometimes she finds herself playing guitar before she has left sleep. Her hands strum but her mind is still dreaming. (It\u2019s her birthday, she\u2019s at the movies, the screen is a tidal wave, someone touches her leg, she wakes up with her fingers tangled in the strings and the kettle whistling.)\n\nThe house is haunted. It should go without saying, but it should be said anyway. The house is haunted, but no one knows anything about the ghost or how it messes with you, except for the fact that every time she goes away (to Texas, to Memphis, to Graceland, to Germany) she always ends up coming home again. It\u2019s the strangest kind of haunting. Everyone calls it, the house, the House of Punishment\u2014more than one mistaken citizen has turned up looking for a similarly-named erotic dungeon on the other side of town\u2014but the name is misleading. It is not a house where someone was punished, or a house where someone might be punished, but a house that replaces punishment; instead of feeling guilt or regret you must play quietly in any corner, and eventually the emotion will resolve itself.\n\nInside, every door frame is notched: the respective growths of former tenants, friends. On one of them, a place where\u2014deep in her cups\u2014she\u2019d measured her height as a full five inches taller than normal; only the next morning did she realize, cotton-mouthed, that she\u2019d been standing on her toes when she\u2019d slid the pencil over the apex of her skull. There had been a Murphy bed once, she was certain, and sometimes when she was very, very tired she would imagine her bed, which was not a Murphy bed, snapping her up into the wall. Next to her bed, in her nightstand drawer, lived the following things: crumpled receipts, red yarn, eight dollars, a white lighter, two undeveloped film cameras, Grether\u2019s Pastilles in their old-timey tin, fistfuls of birthday cards with the shimmer worn off, a pocket-sized copy of the constitution, a pocket knife, a pair of swimming goggles, a pair of recording headphones, shoelaces twisted into a Gordian knot, an unpaid parking ticket, a strip of Peanuts Halloween stickers, an MRI request form from when she sprained her finger, colloidal silver (someone told her it would cure her cold; someone else told her it would give her Argyria), a map of Kyoto (she\u2019d gotten bored at the temple), incense, her first fan letter (she promised herself she\u2019d respond; she never did), a bunch of bolts, a plastic doll\u2019s hand, doggie bags (he\u2019d died over a year ago), an unopened Replacements cassette, an unopened 23 & Me kit, an unopened fortune cookie, unopened pepper spray she doesn\u2019t trust herself to take out of the packaging. In a fake book on her desk\u2014pleather-bound and conspicuously absent a title\u2014she collects her used boarding passes, old concert tickets, disconnected wristbands. It doesn\u2019t escape her notice that she can\u2019t throw anything away, that objects remain unopened, unresolved, untangled, unconsumed. She is always in the middle. She is never at the end of anything.\n\nShe lives near a hospital. All night, she hears sirens, imagines the people being transported to and fro, their bodies speeding along in the back of ambulances and their spirit trying to catch up. She makes jokes. \u201cIf I wake up, someone better be dying,\u201d she says, until one night she wakes up and feels it: someone\u2019s essence slipping past her on the way to somewhere else. After that, she thinks about the hospital as a metaphor, and considers the many ailments the metaphorical hospital could cure, the many symptoms it could treat: Imposter syndrome. Cabin fever. Foot-in-mouth disease. Word vomit.\n\nShe invites her friends\u2014that is to say, her family\u2014over for dinner. She has this one friend whose dad was really obsessed with blood\u2014blood as in family, not the interesting kind of blood\u2014and how it was thicker than water (ew), and then one day her friend looked up the actual expression and it was, The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Shit, right? Anyway, she makes a green bean casserole, which is demolished in short order, and hot rolls. Someone kills a pint of ice cream she\u2019s been saving. Someone else drinks a beer so hard it sputters, erupts.

They lie on the grass and the stone and talk about the skies they were born under. They don\u2019t believe, really, that it makes a difference, but it\u2019s nice to think about.

Mike is also an active recording artist of original material, folk music, cross-cultural collaborations, and he has an ongoing project to record all of the Bach cello suites in acoustically glorious bathrooms of famous concert halls, via BachInTheBathroom.com.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

The stakes are different.\"\n\nThose stakes are what lie at the heart of David Wax Museum's fourth and boldest studio album to date, \"Guesthouse.\" It's the sound of a band reconciling the accountability of marriage and parenthood with the uncertainty and challenges of life on the road; of coming to terms with the limitations of the \"folk\" tag that launched their career and pushing past it into uncharted musical territory; of reimagining their entire approach in the studio to capture the magic and the bliss of their live show. In typical David Wax Museum fashion, the songs on \"Guesthouse\" are simplistic and sophisticated, elegant and plainspoken all at once. Rather than succumbing to the weight of the newfound responsibilities that landed on their doorstep, the band has leaned into the challenges to capture a brilliant portrait of the messy beauty of it all.\n\nThe roots of David Wax Museum stretch back nearly a decade, and all the way from New England to Mexico. As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as \"pure, irresistible joy.\" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding \"like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent\") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music \"global crossover at its best\"). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, and more.\n\nIt was on the road over these past few years as the band and audiences grew, though, that Wax could feel their exuberant live show evolving beyond its formative roots.\n\n\"I felt empowered to start the band because of my time in Mexico studying folk music,\" Wax explains. \"In Boston, the term 'Americana' or 'folk' was just this catchall to describe what everyone was doing. It was helpful to use that to talk about our music at first, but we've found that our hearts feel most shaken, and the band fires on all cylinders, when we're putting on a rock show. What we've tried to retain about our folk origins is the warm sound of people playing acoustic instruments together in a room. But, by embracing more of an indie rock approach, we've colored this record with synthesizers, layers of percussion, and adventurous sonic processing. The mental shift of it helped us feel like we could do anything we wanted. There were no rules that we had to follow in terms of what was 'authentic.'\"\n\nPart of the inspiration for the shift was the presence of guitarist and producer Josh Kaufman, who sat in with the band on tour and added new sounds and textures that the they'd never experimented with before. When it came time to record \"Guesthouse,\" the band knew he had to helm it in the studio.\n\n\"The songs entered this Technicolor, 3D world with Josh,\" explains Wax. \"Aside from his contributions to the arrangements, he really wanted us all to be in a room playing the music together live so that the groove would be central. We brought in two other drummers, and there was a real focus on having as much percussion happening at the same time as possible. We gravitate towards that naturally because of the Mexican influences, all of the syncopations and 6/8 dance rhythms and the energy that that gives us, but we really embraced it this time around.\"\n\nThat emphasis on groove sucks you in from the opening seconds of the kickoff track, \"Every Time Katie,\" a whispered come-on that roils and pulses like an anxious heartbeat and features gorgeous call and response vocals from David and Suz. It's followed by \"Dark Night Of The Heart,\" which pushes the sonic envelope further than any previous David Wax Museum track, blending chamber strings, psychedelic vocal filters, explosive drums, and swirling synthesizers.\n\nWritten partially in Mexico and partially in western Massachusetts, the lyrics on \"Guesthouse\" find Wax writing with more direct, personal honesty than ever before.\n\n\"I had felt really reluctant to talk about personal stuff in the past,\" says Wax. \"I was writing personally, but there were lots of things I was obfuscating or filtering through a character to protect myself from putting too much out there. But it got to a point where it was taking a lot more energy than it was worth to maintain that privacy. When we had our daughter, Calliope, it felt like this sudden release because talking and singing about our lives was becoming more and more integral to what we were doing as artists and who we were as people.\"\n\nThe title track, which draws on several traditional Mexican songs for musical inspiration, is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the life of a traveling musician hunting for a free place to crash, while \"Lose Touch With The World\" faces down the reality of living a life far removed from that of your friends and family, and \"Young Man\" is an earnest musing on growing older.\n\n\"It's about being a parent and coming to terms with what your ambition is,\" explains Wax. \"What part of that is essential to who you are, and what part can you let go of? We have to check in with ourselves and ask what we're doing and why we're doing it more often now because we're not just us putting ourselves through the mental and physical sacrifices of touring anymore,\" he continues. \"Now Calliope is going through it with us, and Suz's dad and my cousin Jordan are going through it with us on the road. And because we're constantly checking and making sure we're doing this for the right reasons, that we feel honest in our hearts about it, I think that's brought new life to what we're doing and a new energy and a new level of commitment.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment brought beautifully to life on \"Everything Changes,\" as Wax and Slezak sing, \"Everything changes / when two becomes three.\" The song was written in response to all of the good-natured warnings about what having a child would mean for the couple, the freedom and sleep and sanity they might lose out on. Instead, they choose to focus on everything they've gained: a beautiful daughter, a stronger bond with their families and fans than ever before, and without a doubt, the most exciting album of their career. For David Wax Museum, the stakes may be higher, but that just means the rewards are even bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Steve Cordon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8140519.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Trixie Mattel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618289.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Twitch Tuesday"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Natalie Grant ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390340.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Christian", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Eight-time GRAMMY\u00ae nominee Natalie Grant has remained one of Christian music\u2019s top-selling artists since her 2005 breakout RIAA Gold-certified album, Awaken.

As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland. He began playing in a variety of Bay Area blues and soul bands in his early 20s, making a name for himself as a hotter than hot live artist. In 1985 he became lead singer and guitarist for the locally popular blues band NiteCry, and began gigging regularly throughout Northern California.\n\nCastro joined Warner Brothers\u2019 artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s, gigging all over the country. He formed the first Tommy Castro Band in 1991, releasing his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig. He hit the road hard, picking up new followers everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Television\u2019s Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label.\n\nCastro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer to massive acclaim. He won four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. His next release, 2011\u2019s Tommy Castro Presents The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue\u2013Live!, was a boisterous and searing collection of highlights from a series of live performances anchored by Castro and an all-star collection of blues giants, including Rick Estrin, Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks and Joe Louis Walker. His relentless road-dog approach\u2014gig after gig, night after night\u2014has won him loyal, lifelong fans everywhere he plays. The Washington Post says Castro is \u201cphenomenal and funky\u201d with \u201csoulful vocals and inspired blues-rock guitar.\u201d\n\nCastro formed The Painkillers in 2012, creating a lean, mean four-piece lineup, capable of delivering soul-shaking, muscular music. The band released The Devil You Know in 2014 and Method To My Madness in 2015, with critics shouting praise and admirers cheering his every move. Castro had stripped his music down to its raw essence with the new, smaller band, sounding bigger than ever. On record and on stage, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers\u2019 road-hardened, seemingly telepathic musicianship bring an unmatched passion to Castro\u2019s blue-eyed California soul and hard-rocking, good-time songs.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

He went back to all his old machines acquired over the years, the TR-808, SH-101, TR-909, TB-303, Juno 60... all instruments that have earned their place in the old school techno hall of fame.\nBack then he said, \u201cFaced with my old drum machines and keyboards again, I felt so at home, like I\u2019d been using them all my life. Getting so much pleasure from going back to those sounds was a revelation. When you switch on a synthesiser, you\u2019re playing an instrument that is part\nof music history. A laptop will always be something you use to send e-mail.\u201d\nMusic Components, the album released under his own name that resulted from this redisco- very of diodes and transistors, is a pure homage to techno classics and the philosophy that accompanied them: long tracks, instrumental, repetitive, powerful and melancholic, carved out\nof one idea explored to the point of obsession. Ten carefully crafted tracks that prove has a life outside the dancefloor, in the vein of classic albums by Carl Craig, Plastikman and Drexciya (to name but a few). But above all, Music Components went totally against the grain,\neschewing all the fashionable traits of the time; saturation, successive layers of sound, a mix of genres, the hybridisation of formats, malformed ideas...\nAfter the unexpected and strangely revealing success of this concept album in the pure techno tradition, it seemed inevitable that Rebotini would pen a follow-up to Music Components . And\nso he has! But just as our man mutated from Zend Avesta to Aleph to Black Strobe, he\u2019s a great fan of doing something different, always returning with new projects and carefully defined iden tities. Don\u2019t expect to hear Music Components Volume 2 . Instead, expect a new approach, a\ndifferent angle, another side of his return to machines.\nSomeone Gave Me Religion is an album resonating from the live tour that followed Music Components , where from behind his machines, Rebotini launched into his music, confronting it with the harsh reality of the dancefl\noor...\nFrom the very start, track one The First Thirteen Minutes Of Love\nopens the album with over ten minutes of ambient unlike anything you\u2019ve heard in years, a long, elegiac composition\nsomewhere between Carl Craig and the chill-out zone at a bygone rave. It\u2019s a warning: take a deep breath before being swept away by eight tracks that span Detroit and Berlin, Front 242\nand Carl Craig, linking them via soaring trance, carefully-crafted minimal, the sound of the 90s, the sound of the new millennium. It\u2019s hard to imagine the strike force and heart pangs it will inevitably inflict on any club in the know.\nNowadays, in an age where vintage is the latest fashion, ancient synths go for silly money on eBay, where the still-worshiped instrument manufacturers are concocting new machines, and\nwhere many famous producers openly criticise the creative limits of composing music on a computer, we can finally see to what extent\nMusic Componentswas a record that managed to cultivate a certain nostalgia for techno\u2019s golden years, whilst refusing to hide in the past.

Laura graduated from Leeds College of Music in 2012 with a first degree in Popular Music. After graduating, she began recording her first single 'Don't Let It Hit Ya', which was released in September 2013 and landed in the Top 20 on the iTunes Country Chart. Her second single 'Snakes & Ladders' followed in 2014 with similar success. 'There is nothing like performing live,' says Laura, who has spent the last year playing shows including supporting fellow country artists The Shires, Ward Thomas and Raintown.

The band released two albums, the breakout debut, Flow, and the follow up release, The Corporate Sugar Daddies. CSD broke up after being passed over for an appearance on NBC's Saved By The Bell - a crushing blow to the group that was already dealing with the pressures of being a hip, local high school act. The rejection from Saved by the Bell knocked the band down and they never really got up. The only thing left do was move on.\n\nAfter graduating from High School a year early, and finding that substitute teaching was not his bag, he decided to move South and go to college. Brock kissed King George goodbye and made his way to Savannah, GA for what would eventually become a turning point in his life.

It\u2019s like my body needs it as much as it needs food, water or sunshine.\u201d Right now, Trago\u2019s immersion in music is almost total. An internationally renowned DJ, producer, live performer and label owner with three critically acclaimed albums to his name, the Dutchman divides his time between all-day studio sessions, DJ gigs and live shows all over the world, and a steady stream of musical collaborations. You sometimes wonder how he finds time to sleep. His dedication to the cause has been unflinching since his earliest years. He grew up in a free-spirited, artistic household, surrounded by music and encouraged to make his own. He entertained himself by recording his own home-made radio shows using the weird and wonderful albums he found in his parents\u2019 record collection. At the age of 15, he decided that he would devote his life to music. \u201cI just had this realization that life is so short, you have to pursue your dreams,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dream was music. That\u2019s all I ever wanted to do \u2013 to listen to it, discover it, make it, play it and share it.\u201d Ever since, he\u2019s been living that dream. Success wasn\u2019t instant, and in his early years in Amsterdam he barely eked a living DJing in coffee shops, earning just enough to afford to feed his vinyl addiction. \u201cAs long as I had enough to live and buy records, I was happy,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt also gave me more time to make music.\u201d He was offered encouragement in these difficult early days by a number of figures on the Dutch scene, with the likes of Mike Kivits (AKA Aardvarck) and Steven de Peven (Awanto3) happy to act as unofficial mentors. As he still does now, Tom poured his heart and soul into making music. Early experiments with blends of experimental hiphop, jazz, Latin influences, Afrobeat sounds and soul-flecked broken beat caught the ear of local labels and producers, before he began to apply his composition and production skills to house music. By the time local label Rush Hour snapped up his debut single, \u201cLive With The BBQ\u201d, in 2006, he\u2019d already developed a trademark style that blended the best of three decades of dance music \u2013 disco, boogie, synth funk, Detroit techno and more \u2013 with insatiable house rhythms and an intrinsic grasp of what makes dancefloors tick. It\u2019s this blend, not to mention his love of collaborating with musicians, vocalists and producers from Amsterdam and beyond (think Romanthony, San Proper, Awanto 3, Cinnaman, Tyree Cooper and Bok Bok), which makes his music so irresistible. Given his impressive track record, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that several of his tracks \u2013 not least the rush-inducing \u201cUse Me Again\u201d and 2015\u2019s equally delicious \u201cHidden Heart Of Gold\u201d and \u201cBrutal Romance\u201d \u2013 sound like future classics. It\u2019s not surprising that Tom is a man in demand. Aside from travelling the glove, he continues to develop the Voyage Direct label he founded in 2010, an outlet for Dutch electronic music that\u2019s more like an extended family of like-minded musicians than a regular imprint. It celebrated its\u2019 fifth birthday in Spring 2015 with a label compilation, ahead of an expansive tour featuring appearances from various \u201cVD\u201d family members. As time moves on, Tom continues to pour his heart and soul into music, whether DJing, performing live or making new tracks. If you bump into him in the corner of some dark, sweaty club, you\u2019re likely to find him excitedly talking about ideas for new projects \u2013 from film soundtracks to audiovisual performances and straight-up club tracks \u2013 or waxing lyrical about hitherto unknown producers he\u2019s discovered in Amsterdam or Rotterdam.

The first is an American doom / sludge rock band from Louisiana, characterized by their extremely slow, low-keyed, hardcore and brooding songs.\n\nStarting in 1989 and taking its name from the Crowbar group in NOLA (New Orleans), Kirk Windstein went on to pioneer slow and heavy music with a unique vocal style. Their first album, \"Obedience Through Suffering\" was released in 1991, but failed to achieve notoriety. By 1993's self-titled (Crowbar) album, personal friend Phil Anselmo (Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual among others) produced the record, which eventually led to national promotion on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. Phil sang back up on a few tracks and sang background on \"Broken Glass\" which rounded out the anthems \"All I Had (I Gave),\" \"I Have Failed\" and \"Existence is Punishment\" along with a new take on the Led Zeppelin song \"No Quarter.\" Following their success the band went on to record music videos, major tours with Pantera, and more albums. Their band stage antics became infamous, which led to being immoralized in the Pantera \"Home Video 3\" and Crowbar's \"Like Broken\" Home Video.\n\nAs time moved on the band lost its founding members with the exception on vocal and guitarist Kirk Windstein. After Todd Strange left the band, the trademark 300 pound + band members slimmed down and the heaviness was only in the music and not the band members. The band continues to perform, borrowing members from NOLA metal bands like Goatwhore and Acid Bath. In their recent 2005 release, \"Life's Blood For The Downtrodden\" Pantera bassist rex brown lent his bass duties and keyboard playing and Down's producer Warren Riker.\n\n2).

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe. Their show is a carnival of two that will take you from the Moulin Rouge to CBGBs and back again.

Combining this with an interest in reggae (shown to him at an early age by his Jamaican mother) and rock (via his Irish father), LT\u2019s adventurous love of music and performing onstage grew throughout the years, culminating in the release of his first EP at age 17. He has since grown into a vibrant and compelling talent. LTtheMonk\u2019s 2015 debut album, Monk in London, described his career, relationship with his home city and journey to adulthood. His 2017 release The Dark Side of the Monk was an introspective and wide-ranging session rooted in California production aesthetics and informed by contemporary race politics.\nHaving moved from the UK megacity to Hamilton, Ontario in 2017, listeners might expect LT\u2019s latest outing Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop to reflect another leap in personal and artistic evolution. And they would not be disappointed. The album is as questioning as its predecessors, serving up an in-depth exploration of his romantic relationships, place in hip-hop and the music industry, and more discoveries of his persona. The album\u2019s title nods to Diamond D\u2019s 1992 classic Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop, but the album is of-the-moment and crisply defined by local players \u2014 the sounds of Hamilton producer Judah Jump, plus Hamilton hip-hop and R&B artists Hoss Bowman and Viktoria Csik \u2014 as well as collaborations with New York\u2019s YoHanMadeTheBeat, Canadian musicians such as Aisha Barrow, Lucas Hibbs and Owen Gow, and (in a call-back to his roots) longtime friend, rapper and producer ROYOS from South London.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bethany Cosentino ( Best Coast ) ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Travis Shallow ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9010584.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Jason Moore - bass, Brian Mason - drums, Travis Shallow - lead vocals guitar, songwriter, Bob Russell - guitar, pedal steel, dobro", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Travis Shallow (born Travis Leigh Shallow; July 31, 1984) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and recording artist.\n\nHe is best known for his prolific solo career, and as a former member of alternative country band A Few Good Liars, with whom he recorded one studio album in 2011 titled, Battered Wooden Body. \"That album showcases the harmony vocal power of the group and Shallow sings songs that can be tender and those that traffic in darkness.

Her current album Songs of Love and Freedom was named \u201cBest New Soul on Bandcamp\u201d by the Bandcamp editorial team, who described the project as \u201cstirringly timeless and modern.\u201d\n\nHer sound, as soothing as it is rich, is musically mature, and rooted in a deep appreciation for mid-century soul and jazz, 90\u2019s R&B, and re-imagined folk music. Yet her fresh faced lyrics boldly portray the heart young Cecily has fought for, and the wisdom of love earned and freedom gained over a life of being misunderstood and told she was \u201cbefore her time\u201d or \u201cmature beyond her years.\u201d This influence gives her work a unique sensuality that informs not only her vocal approach, but also her self-reflecting lyrics, grappling with self-acceptance, vulnerability, and rebirth.\n\nIn her songs you\u2019ll hear the influence of growing up surrounded by her parents vast record collection. Her father, a lover of Miles Davis, and her mother, a Smokey Robinson fan, filled their home with soulful sounds that captivated their daughter, and which she has channeled into her own work. Soulbounce says that Cecily creates \u201cmusic that pulls from the past but looks toward the future.\u201d\n\nCecily has opened for award winning jazz and soul artists Gregory Porter and Jose James, R&B stars Johnny Gill, Kenny Lattimore, and Elle Varner, folk artist Becca Stevens, and alternative soul pioneer Bilal. She has played at the legendary Blues Alley and the Apollo Music Cafe, as well as The Kennedy Center, The Hamilton, The Howard Theater, and Bethesda Blues & Jazz Supper Club. In 2017, Cecily and her band were invited by the US Embassy to perform in Colombia at the VI Annual Mompox Jazz Festival.\n\nCecily was selected to be part of the Strathmore Artist-in-Residence class of 2018, a program that honed her performance skills and encouraged genre-defying collaborations. Cecily was also the recipient of a 2018 Project Grant from the Montgomery County Arts and Humanities Council, which she is using to fund her next studio project about the mastery of love.\n\nAs a Washington, DC native, raised in a city synonymous with politics, it was an obvious choice to pursue a career in public service. But by the age of 21, Cecily walked out of her International Relations classroom feeling disillusioned. She told her mother that after 10 years of singing as a hobby, she wanted to dedicate her life to music.

My granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy was born in Caswell County in 1795. Maybe we go back further, I don't know.\n\nOn Friday the 13th, November 1970, I was born at the Cape Fear Valley Hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, probably the biggest military town in the country. Fort Bragg alone covers 250 square miles, and the used car dealerships and titty bars are like stars in the sky, grains of sand on the beach. The ground is sandy and the woods are open and piney, with tall loblollies, jack oaks, and the longleaf pine.\n\nWe left for Fort Worth, Texas when I was about 2 or 3, so that dad could attend Southwest Theological Seminary. My first memory is of crossing the Mississppi in a U-Haul. My dad was excited about the bridge and couldn't stop talking about how it was an engineering marvel and all.\n\nFrom there, the memories get thicker, catching tarantulas after a rainstorm, putting pennies on the railroad track, barefoot ooching across the Texas road, so hot the asphalt was soft. There was a snowstorm. We've got pictures.\n\nDad got a commision to preach in an English-speaking church in what was then West Germany, in a little town called Vernheim. Our landlord worked for Mercedes, got a new one every year, and kept a weinkellar like a liquor store. Dad would give me the rent check, I'd walk it upstairs, and the hausfrau would pinch my cheeks and give me a chocolate bar as big as my head.\n\nIn church, my father preached and my mother played piano for the services. I learned how to sing in that church and even did a solo of \"Amazing Grace\" for the congregation. We had a piano in the house and my mom gave me some lessons. I did really well, but I got bored with the workbook/lesson plan style. My brother had a guitar and that was cooler. We moved to Giessen a few years later and he got \"The Wall\" for a birthday present from a friend. Mom and Dad almost didn't let him keep it, 'cause there were \"disturbing images\" on the inside. They relented and Gray taught me my first guitar piece, that cool acoustic guitar solo in A minor. I was 8.\n\nWhen I was about ten, we came back to the states, my daddy lost his mind, divorced my mom, and started drinking and managing Eckerds drug stores. He went through another wife and found the construction industry, wherein he could stay drunk all day. That finally lead him to recovery and he spent the rest of his life building houses for storm victims and Habitat whenever he could. He was a good man with a lot of demons, and he married a third time 'til death did he part in 1999. His favorite song was \"Amazing Grace\" and his vinyl bluegrass collection influenced me greatly, especially Flatt and Scruggs and the Stanley Brothers. He bought a banjo once and became so frustrated with it that he turned it into a clock.\n\nMom was a rock through all of that, got a good job at UNC, paid a man to build her a log cabin in the country outside of Chapel Hill, and did her best to raise me. I was a real pain in the ass. Once I got my own guitar, I had a place to put all my teen angst, but it didn't help my schoolwork at all. I probably set records for non-attendance and spent a lot of time running around in the deep woods of western Orange County. Four years in the high school jazz big band program taught me the majority of what I still know about music theory. Along with an early enlistment in the Navy, music got me through and out into the real world, where I finally got my ass kicked.\n\nI spent the next four years touring the Mediterranean on a tank landing ship out of Little Creek Naval Base in Norfolk, VA. The open ocean is a powerful thing to behold. The stars at night are unlike anything you will see on this Earth anymore; it is the last great wilderness. Besides that, being tear-gassed was about the most fun I ever had in the Navy. I carried a guitar behind my bunk everywhere we went and made strange four-track recordings when we were in port and there was an empty berthing to use as a late-night studio. Of all the guys I knew on ship, I still remember the names of the ones I played music with- Robert Thomas, David Saylor, Hadji Henderson.\n\nAfter my time was up, I spent some days in Virgina Beach, playing in a heavy rock band called Coup d'Etat at first, and then Day 11, which was just a license plate we saw at a grocery store one day. We were sort of prog, like Bad Brains meets King Crimson and we rubbed Tiger Balm on our nads before we took the stage because Fishbone said that they did. They probably said that just to see if anyone would do it. A girlfriend gave me my first acoustic guitar, a Fender; I think she stole it. She stole enough money from me that I think I paid her for it.\n\nVirginia Beach outright sucked, so I came home to work at Weaver Street Market and started another band called Scalliwag. I knew there was something missing from my culinary life (mac'n'cheese, ramen, pizza) and the job at Weaver Street was a cry for help. It turned out to be the social hub of Carrboro, NC and I met a lot of people who are still my close friends today. The rock band thing wasn't working out, so I started playing the acoustic more and met a lot of other acoustic musicians.\n\nMy friends Leo Lorenzoni and Michael Kovich told me about an Old-time fiddler's convention up in Buena Vista, VA and it sounded like just a laid-back, weekend-long party. I cruised up there and hung out with them; I can't even remember if I had a tent. It changed my life and it changed my music, just banging away on an A chord for hours at a time and sippin' that corn liquor. I didn't know the songs and I didn't care. Whatever these people had a hold of, I wanted some of it. It shot straight down into my veins like lightning and made my hair stand up on end. The music was intense, lyrically cut down to the bone, no bullshit. They didn't have bridges; bridges were for pussies. People got killed, died or fell in love and then got killed or maybe drank themselves to death. They weren't gonna be treated this way and they'd trade their shoes for a little bottle of booze. They were big, like John Henry and Wild Bill Jones, all fists and whiskey, heartbroken and angry as I was, ready to kill somebody.\n\nI started going to Clifftop and Mt. Airy and finding Old-time jams at home and on the road, anywhere my new friends lived. I got to thinking that I could write songs like that, or maybe one just fell out of me and I thought, \"Wow, there it is.\" Either way, I figured nobody was writing songs like that anymore, at least nobody I'd heard, and I knew that style was just technique. In other words, those songs didn't sound old because they were old; they sounded old because they were written in an old style. There wasn't a reason in the world why somebody couldn't write a song like that, if he wanted to.\n\n\"Ashe County Fair\" was probably the first song I wrote like that. Another one was \"Velma,\" a song I wrote about the woman who killed my grandfather. I think somebody dies in most of the songs on my first album. Three of them die in \"Velma.\" I was also playing Irish music by the time I recorded, so I played the guitar parts in an alternate tuning, DADGAD. In retrospect, it gives the whole album a dark, open sound that takes the themes over the edge and out into the dripping woods.\n\nI started touring full-time in 2000, realizing that I could do it as a solo performer and actually make a living. Of course, that's what every other singer/songwriter in America was doing, too, but I didn't even know what a singer/songwriter was, so that didn't bother me. I thought I was a folk musician. Over time, I realized that folk got cross-dressed and don't mean what it used to mean anymore. I think my friend Aengus Finnan said it better than anybody I've heard yet, \"It's a style of presentation.\" So that's just it, as long as you don't put on the razzle-dazzle and shake your ass in a sequin skirt, you can be a folk musician. Sit there on a stool and play your tuba, tell a story once in a while and wear some Birckenstocks. Everybody will think you're a folk musician.\n\nIn 2002, I went to the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas, where there are lots of these folk musicians, only mostly songwriters. I wandered around for a week looking for the dance tent and the fiddle bands before I realized what I've already said about the word \"folk.\" It ended up being an amazing and inspiring experience and I've been for all 18 days every year since. At the 2003 festival, I won the New Folk competition and got hired on as a performer for the next three years. I never took to Birckenstocks and my friend Anais Mitchell helped me find a great pair of boots in Austin. They're Fryes.\n\nIn 2004, Dromedary and I recorded an album together called \"The Sea and the Sky,\" which brings beautiful instruments from all over the world into my sound and songwriting. I've toured in Europe and the US with them, including a return to Kerrville and two consecutive years at the Moab Folk Festival in gorgeous Moab, Utah. If you're not familiar with Dromedary, I highly recommend you go to dromedarymusic.com right now- well, after you read the rest of this, anyway. Their music is magic, like the voice of Emmylou Harris, an instant drop in the shoulders, a glaze on the eyes, a trip back to childhood. I'm honored to be friends with them and occasionally share the three-man funk in a rental car.\n\nThe next album was a rock 'n' roll album called \"This Is The New That.\" Rock 'n' roll, because I just didn't know how else to play these songs. They're rock 'n' roll songs. It leads off with a revision of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" Dromedary came back into the studio with me and played electric guitars. Rock 'n' Roll Hall-of-Famer and Muscle Shoals session guitarist Will McFarlane sits in on a few. It was amazing to watch him work, a blue-eyed gent in a kilt ripping the blues from stem to stern. When the first take was done, there were no questions and nothing left to be done but get the cat off the ceiling. What a pro.\n\nWill McFarlane told me a story about recording with Frank Sinatra, wherein Frank walked in and sang the whole album, no retakes. The engineer asked him to sing the first few words of the first song again, because he hadn't had time for a line check. Apparently, Ol' Blue Eyes squared his shoulders and told the engineer, \"Overdubbing's for faggots,\" and walked out. Political incorrectness aside, I rather like his style.\n\nTexas is a huge influence on my writing. \"The Law and the Lonesome\" is what might have happened if Townes Van Zandt had made a record with Doc Watson. Tamara Kater of Canada's venerable folk mag Penguin Eggs called \"The Law and the Lonesome\" her \"album of the decade.\" Co-produced by the brilliant Chris Bartos in Toronto, \"The Law and the Lonesome\" features a couple of co-writes with my friend Corin Raymond. We wrote the title track together, which was featured in a songwriting class at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nI beat \"Radio Soul\" and recorded \"Cackalack\" in six hours with a handful of the best musicians in Toronto, although it sounds like it was recorded in a barn in North Carolina. Ken Whitely, who has gold and platinum records to his name, engineered the record in his converted garage with Nik Tjelios. As of mid-January 2011, \"Cackalack\" was #1 on Roots Music Reports folk radio chart. I went back to Canada and made a record in two days in Gimli, Manitoba with Alexa Dirks of Begonia and Andrina Turenne singing harmonies. Joanna Miller, Rej Ricard, and Grant Siemens round out the all-star Winnipeg crew.\n\nJonathan Byrd & The Pickup Cowboys is my latest record and project. We play every Wednesday at a little roadhouse called The Kraken on highway 54 outside Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The residency has become a community for some and a pilgrimage for others. Tune in on facebook live, 7-10pm Eastern Time any Wednesday, or make the trip to join us.

In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

Allen has since gone on to produce several acclaimed solo records, playing every instrument himself, while tastefully complementing his smooth to soaring voice. In addition to drums, guitars, etc., Jake often stresses his belief in using the studio itself as a key instrument to create his massive productions and concept albums. His deep and detailed records lend themselves to the fleeting practice of sitting down and really listening to a record from start to finish.\n\nBy his late teens, Jake found himself being drawn to the sounds of finger-style guitar trailblazers like Michael Hedges and Andy McKee. He started to pin point his focus on acoustic guitar, crafting his own breed of six string wizardry. On top of a two-hands on the neck, percussive tapping style, Jake employed an array of effects and live looping to create an engaging solo performance.

The dynamic pair are recording/performing artists, songwriters, musicians, audio engineers and producers.\n\nTheir first single, (an out-and-proud Trip Hop style song titled \"#Queen\") has achieved over 50k streams on Spotify and over 25k views on the official music video via YouTube since it's release on October 5th, 2018. Their follow up single (a soft, House track titled \"Can Be Beautiful\") was released on December 21st, 2018, and has since been featured on Billboard Sound and AXS.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel in August of 2013 and making their debut as Elvis Presley's daughter (Lisa Marie Presley)'s supporting act that same year, together they have since begun to take the music world by storm.\n\nThe duo boast a long list of live touring accomplishments and come equipped with a catalog of over 200 original songs. Their outstanding, solid fan base is made up of an array of live audiences, the YouTube community, and social media; where their popularity is ever increasing. Posting covers of both popular and original songs, live performances, v-logs, and behind-the-scenes videos weekly, their YouTube channel has recently reached an impressive tally of over 3 quarter million views overall.\n\nThe sibling duo regularly perform and tour nationally and have frequented venues such as LA's El Rey Theatre, San Juan Capistrano's The Coach House, and (just recently) have played the House of Blues in Anaheim (twice just in 2018), Bar 20 at the Grafton Hotel in Beverly Hills, the Simi Valley fireworks celebration (with over 20,000 people in attendance), at the Gibson theater in Beverly Hills, at Pickwick's Pub in Woodland Hills, a headlining show at Monterey Court in Tucson, AZ, and much more. Nicole & Scotty are currently booking for 2019, and inquiries can be emailed to ulomag28@sbcglobal.net.\n\nThey continuously entertain radio and television appearances; a few of which have included Los Angeles' Hot 103.9 Move to the Music, KHTS 98.1 FM, New York station Gold Star Radio, Las Vegas' 702 ROX, and the TV Entertainment segment Michelle's Corner. Their music is played regularly on a rapidly growing list of stations world wide, proving that the duo are not only rapidly garnering global recognition, but are also vastly appreciated and loved by their fans from all over the world.\n\nThe siblings also dabble in acting; with Scotty having co-starred in an episode of HBO's popular comedy series \"Vice Principals\", which aired October 8th, 2017.\n\nNicole & Scotty have also been featured in several major entertainment publications; including the international music trade magazine, \"Music Connection\" and the entertainment review, \"What's REALLY Going ON\", (where Nicole occasionally writes her own column and where the sister/brother duo were featured front cover in April of 2015).\n\nFrom playing shows with touring musicians who've accompanied major bands and artists (such as The Four Seasons, Barry Manilow,or John Mayer), to garnering attention from well respected industry folks, (such as producer Teddy Riley), making connections and long lasting relationships in the industry are extremely important to Nicole & Scotty.\n\nPerforming for charities and worthy causes they strongly stand for is also a passion of theirs; the siblings having played shows to raise breast cancer awareness, raise funds for youth programs, and entertain schools in the past.\n\nWhen asked, the siblings cite their brand of Pop music as \"current, energetic and brutally honest\". Their sound is indeed uniquely sincere in a genre where it is crucial to uphold the integrity of new and innovative music. The duo delivers just that by stringing raw, personal lyrics through hypnotic hooks and synth layered foundations, accompanied by thrumming bass lines and drum patterns emulating the heartbeat of their own sound. Combining an assortment of authentic Pop arrangements and Trap influence with Electronic Dance beats and rhythms, the duo offer up a wide variety of innovative and well crafted songs that translate deep rooted emotions of every nature to their listeners. As if their artistic thumbprints aren't already present enough in their recordings, a melodic acoustic and the duo's signature ambient electric guitar can be heard flitting in and out of the tunes the pair proudly create and stand by.\n\nNicole, (21), and Scotty, (17), are two young and immensely talented musicians intent on continuing a journey full of song, and wish to share the melodies in their hearts with the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Matt Costa ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10369389.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Folk, Acoustic, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When Matt Costa started working on the songs for his sixth record Yellow Coat, he\u2019d been on tour for the better part of two years and had just ended a relationship of almost a decade. The music needed to exist, and it was as much an emotional exercise as a creative one.\n\u201cI think every other record that I've written, I wrote knowing that the songs would have an outlet,\u201d Costa says \u201cAnd for this one, I really didn\u2019t. It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating. But now everyone's going through something. And as difficult as that is, there's comfort in that too. Because we're all in it together, and we have been the whole time. Except now we can actually feel it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Plain White T's ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8800211.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Poprock, Power Pop, Alt Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Download + Stream 'Parallel Universe' on all your favorite music sites", "otherInfo": "Major thanks for tuning in for Tom's previous FB live session!\n\nThis time, Tom is BACK and is looking for YOU to vote on the 5 songs he will perform via FB messenger.\n\nSign up to be notified when voting begins for the next live set list now ->>> https://linktr.ee/plainwhitets"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Flying Lotus ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9280120.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Jazz, Electronic, Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Los Angeles resident Steven Ellison a.k.a.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do.

Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it.

Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip.

After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club.

Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cWEST COAST WEDNESDAYS\u201d EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.
