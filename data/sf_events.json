But where E*MO*TION, which featured the platinum single \"I Really Like You,\" was an \u201980s-influenced synth-pop classic that Rolling Stone called \u201ca pop masterclass\u201d and Stereogum called \u201cindisputable, unfuckwithable pop genius,\u201d Dedicated has a more \u201970s-inspired feel at times (though the album defies categorization as a whole). At one point, Jepsen was sure she was making a disco opus. \u201cThe title was going to be \u2018Disco Sweat,\u2019\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI really bought into it.\u201d But Jepsen had a change of heart thanks to her travels over the past two years, which included writing trips to the Swedish countryside (\u201cIt was spring and there were fields of flowers, homemade breads, and kittens running everywhere\u201d) and a beach in Nicaragua, where she surfed and stayed in a cabana-like casita. Then there was an Eat Pray Love-esque solo vacation in Italy. \u201cI had so many songs,\u201d she says. \u201cI needed some space to walk around, reflect, eat pasta, and get to know myself a bit.\u201d\n\nEventually Jepsen landed on what she thought was a finished album, \u201cbut then I just kept trying to beat it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became like a Tetris game of replacing songs when something new started to feel like it was winning.\u201d Working with a crew of trusted songwriters and producers, among them John Hill, Jack Antonoff, Captain Cuts, Kyle Shearer, James Flannigan, Patrik Berger, and her longtime collaborator Tavish Crowe, Jepsen indulged in more sonic experimentation than she has in the past. \u201cWhatever my mood is in life, it very much affects what I\u2019m writing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo maybe one of these emo songs fits, one of the disco songs fits. We can use three infatuation songs, but beyond that people are going to be sick. Even though the songs were written in different places with different people, they all feel like what my life has been like over the past three years.\u201d\n\nIn November 2018, Jepsen released \u201cParty for One,\u201d an empowering ode to the necessity of loving yourself before anyone else can love you \u2014 a message she describes as \u201chuge to me.\u201d The song \u201cJulien,\u201d which was inspired by a guy Jepsen met with that name, considers the idea of timeless love. \u201cThe first thing out of my mouth when I met this guy was, \u2018You have the most beautiful name,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cJulien\u201d paved the way for Dedicated, which finds her reflecting on the idea of what it means to be that committed to someone. \u201cThat\u2019s where the title came from,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought about the word \u2018dedicated\u2019 and how it\u2019s about being there for someone through thick and thin. It's something I thought about a lot while making this album, so it felt like a fitting title.\u201d\n\nConflicting feelings about her romantic relationships inspired the songs \u201cRight Words Wrong Time\u201d and \u201cThe Sound.\u201d She also acknowledges how love can feel like an addiction on \u201cNo Drug Like Me,\u201d which is about a relationship that feels impossible but you\u2019re willing to be terrified and go for it anyway. \u201cToo Much.\u201d \u201cI think all people everywhere have, at some point or another, experienced a similar worry that \u2018too much\u2019 is a bad thing, when it\u2019s in fact a great thing,\u201d she says. \u201cThis song was my discovery of that. The insecurities of that even.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow That I Found You\u201d is about the bliss of finding new, securely attached love. There are also bold, cheeky songs like \u201cEverything He Needs,\u201d (a reinterpretation of the love song in the Disney film Popeye) and \u201cWant You in My Room,\u201d which Jepsen describes as an \u201call-out unabashed come-on song.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of hopeless romantics left out there,\u201d Jepsen says. \u201cBut I believe in it. Romantic love is always going to come with some sort of euphoric high to me, so I keep singing about it. Even though a million songs have been written about it, I\u2019ll still contribute my couple thousand, so by the time I'm gone, you'll know that I was a believer, too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1807 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "LPX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9351486.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Sun Apr 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-12", "Genre": "Brooklyn, New York", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Fox Theater", "moreBioInfo": "www.IAMLPX.com\ninstagram.com/LPX\nfacebook.com/IAMLPX\ntwitter.com/IAMLPX", "otherInfo": "Carly Rae Jepsen with support from LPX"}, {"Address": "400 Eddy St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Theo Croker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9178786.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414392, 37.78382], "Date": "Sun Apr 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-12", "Genre": "Jazz, Funk, Hip Hop, Jazz Fusion", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Black Cat", "moreBioInfo": "Producer, composer, & trumpeter Theo Croker is an adventurous musician whose adept skills find him at home playing standards, swinging post-bop, or more groove-oriented electric jazz. A native of Leesburg, Florida, Croker is the grandson of the late great jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham. He began playing trumpet around age 11 after hearing Cheatham play in New York City, and by his teens was studying music at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville, Florida. From 2003 to 2007, Croker attended the music conservatory at Oberlin College. While at Oberlin, he was mentored by legendary trumpeter and educator Donald Byrd. Also during this time, he earned the Presser Music Foundation Award, which funded his debut album, 2006's Fundamentals. After graduating Oberlin, Croker relocated to China, where he took up residency at Shanghai's House of Blues. His 2009 album, In the Tradition, paid tribute to Cheatham.\n\nIn 2013, Croker returned to the States and began work on his third solo album, the Dee Dee Bridgewater-produced Afro Physicist. Released in 2014 on OKeh/Sony Masterworks Records, the Echo Award nominated album found him branching out stylistically, weaving elements of funk, Latin jazz, and hip-hop into his sound. In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d. His live performances, the Huffington Post lauded Croker\u2019s band DVRKFUNK, saying they were \u201ca tight front line that weave in serpentine precision and are backed by a powerful rhythm section that pushes the groove.\u201d Outside of his solo career, Croker has lent his inimitable talents as composer, arranger and musician to J.

The two have gone from sleepy English steel town obscurity to craft-smiths ready to make a global impact.\n\nInspired by their music aficionado father who raised the duo on a steady diet of The Rolling Stones and The Everly Brothers, the two would rehearse in the family kitchen while scrounging for gigs in their blue-collar hometown of Scunthorpe, England. Laughs Rupert, \u201cWe\u2019d walk into pubs and clubs as kids and ask the owner if we could play something for the local drunks at 2pm.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until a move to London and the success of their track \u201cAces,\u201d a song recorded in their studio apartment, that the boys from Scunthorpe went from pub performers to BBC radio staples.\n\nThe brothers quickly collected a global audience of fans, none more influential than iconic producer Rick Rubin, who quickly recognized their talent and promptly took the brothers under his wing. \u201cI liked that their songwriting seemed like it was from another era,\u201d explains Rubin. \u201cIt\u2019s making something new again with these traditional influences.\u201d Henry adds, \u201cThe album was recorded using all real instruments and a live band, resulting in a different sound than what\u2019s present in much of today\u2019s popular music.\u201d Adds Rupert of the collaboration, \u201cIt was incredibly exciting - he\u2019s worked with some of our favorite artists of all time and is such a versatile producer. He helped us recognize the strength of Henry and I playing and singing together; it was a foundation to build upon and the guidance we needed.\u201d\n\nThe brothers\u2019 artistic background and pedigree come into full focus on their debut studio album ALL MY SHADES OF BLUE (out 6/01 via Ramseur), produced by Rubin and featuring Henry on acoustic guitar and Rupert on electric and acoustic guitar, harmonica, and bass. The album also includes the talents of such boldface names as Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on drums, along with The Killers\u2019 Dave Keuning on strings and Faces and Small Faces legend Ian McLagan on keyboards. The record features both music and lyrics written by the boys throughout their improbable journey. Says Rupert, speaking about both the album and the duo\u2019s entire career, \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky in the sense that we\u2019ve been able to do whatever we\u2019ve wanted musically and had it all recorded to the best quality with the best musicians and collaborators. In today\u2019s industry, you don\u2019t usually get that freedom. If nothing else, we\u2019re making the music we want to make and that\u2019s enough for me.

His was the sort of upbringing where \u201cif you\u2019re going to do something and you\u2019re not going to do it one-hundred percent you shouldn\u2019t do it all.\u201d It\u2019s why the 25-year-old singer-songwriter treats each song he writes with a painstaking level of dedication, reverence, respect and, as he\u2019ll readily admit, even a bit of obsession. McCollum says that when a particular melody or lyric or emotion is tugging at him, hell, he might just stay in his room for days at a time working it out. He can\u2019t help himself.\n\nThat\u2019s because for the Austin-based singer and multi-instrumentalist the end result is worth the occasional pain in the process. \u201cThat\u2019s where I find my identity,\u201d McCollum, who broke out with the revealing and critically adored 2013 debut The Limestone Kid and now returns with his highly anticipated follow-up album, Probably Wrong, says of penning soul-baring, honest and forthright Americana anthems. \u201cIt just takes over,\u201d he says of the songwriting muse and, one senses, his ever-winding, sometimes gut-wrenching journey as an introspective musician.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this life. It chose me.\u201c\n\nSet for release on November 10 independently, Probably Wrong, pulls back the curtain and reveals McCollum like never before. The 10-track LP, written after the dissolution of a long-term relationship, is equal parts introspective, self-flagellating and transcendent. It\u2019s also the most honest McCollum has ever been in song. There\u2019s an inherent pain that bleeds through in the raw honesty of stunning songs including \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d and \u201cHell of a Year.\u201d For McCollum, putting his most intimate thoughts and feelings to song is more of a welcome relief than an act of bloodletting. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about my feelings very often,\u201d he notes. \u201cI keep a lot of things in most of the time and I don\u2019t want anybody else to have to deal with my shit. I just write songs instead.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of The Limestone Kid\u2019s release, and its lead single \u201cMeet Me in the Middle\u201d finding success at regional radio, McCollum says \u201cin the blink of an eye\u201d his life drastically changed.\u201d The then-22-year-old went from a life of smoking pot on his couch and passing his days strumming the guitar to traveling from one gig to the next not as a nobody but rather a revered traveling musician with a fervent fanbase. McCollum always wanted to be a singer-songwriter but he admits he was caught a bit off guard by the buzz around Limestone. \u201cI was playing catch up for two years,\u201d he says.\n\nIn speaking with McCollum, it\u2019s easy to detect the sense of wonderment and romance he still attaches to the brutally honest songwriters he first revered during his teenage years. Men like Townes Van Zandt, Todd Snider, Steve Earle and James McMurtry \u2014 even as a wide-eyed and innocent young man, McCollum sensed these musicians were speaking to a more powerful truth. \u201cIt would jerk my soul out of me,\u201d he says of encountering and quickly becoming enamored with their music and subsequently dedicating his life to molding songs of a similarly revealing bent. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I\u2019ve ever encountered that has had as much influence on me,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to listen to. It was my thing.\u201d\n\nTo that end, when he began writing the songs that would ultimately comprise Probably Wrong, McCollum felt it necessary to be alone with little more than his emotions and a guitar. \u201cI needed to write this record and be on my own,\u201d he says of what led him to end a two-year relationship and retreat inward. \u201cI felt very misunderstood throughout the entire situation,\u201d he adds. \u201cI broke my own heart for the first time just to write this record.\u201d For six weeks, McCollum did nothing but stare at a piece of paper filled with soul-crushing lyrics and engage with his sadness. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a sad person,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cBut I had done it to myself intentionally.\u201d\n\nThe pain still lingers, but McCollum says accessing it to write his new album allowed him to pen some of his most poignant material to date. \u201cHell of a Year,\u201d which he calls his \u201csleeper favorite of the record,\u201d came from McCollum breaking down one night in his truck in a fast-food parking lot. \u201cMy heart\u2019s out of love/I fell out of line/I swore I\u2019d never leave again/And I lied,\u201d he sings over a gentle acoustic guitar figure. \u201cWhen I set out to write this record this was the type of song I was gunning for,\u201d he says of \u201cHell of a Year.\u201d \u201cIt was the hardest song I\u2019ve ever written as far as being that honest. But after doing so I could go back to being happy for a little bit.\u201d On the slow rolling \u201cMisunderstood,\u201d the singer throws his hands in the air and makes peace with what he can\u2019t control. \u201cYou told me I was no good/It\u2019s alright babe/I\u2019m pretty used to being misunderstood.\u201d\n\nSinging such soul-baring songs is a decidedly therapeutic act for McCollum. \u201cWhen the melody is so spot-on and it hooks me everything that I have been bottling up or not talking about comes out.\u201d It\u2019s why the singer says he lives to perform. \u201cNext to the songwriting the live show is most important,\u201d he offers. Though, seeing as many of his gigs are rowdy, upbeat affairs, he says he searches for the right moments to pepper his set with more emotional numbers. \u201cI\u2019m constantly trying to find ways to make our live show better,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cAnd my confidence level keeps going up and up. Most of the time onstage I\u2019m running around like I\u2019m the man,\u201d he adds with a laugh, \u201cbut I\u2019m definitely not.\u201d\n\nThe goal going forward then, McCollum insists, is to never remain stagnant. He idolizes musicians like John Mayer whom he says are always redefining their creativity. He intends to do the same. \u201cMy goal is to totally evolve and reinvent myself with each record I make,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing with each record and really not giving a shit. And if you can pull that off, well, that\u2019s a pretty special thing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Snotty Nose Rez Kids ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10068195.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Tue Apr 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-14", "Genre": "Indigenous Hip-hop, Hip-hop, Rap, Hip Hop, Trap", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "Snotty Nose Rez Kids is a Haisla Hip-Hop duo from Kitimat, BC, composed of rappers Yung Trybez & Young D.

The two have gone from sleepy English steel town obscurity to craft-smiths ready to make a global impact.\n\nInspired by their music aficionado father who raised the duo on a steady diet of The Rolling Stones and The Everly Brothers, the two would rehearse in the family kitchen while scrounging for gigs in their blue-collar hometown of Scunthorpe, England.

He helped us recognize the strength of Henry and I playing and singing together; it was a foundation to build upon and the guidance we needed.\u201d\n\nThe brothers\u2019 artistic background and pedigree come into full focus on their debut studio album ALL MY SHADES OF BLUE (out 6/01 via Ramseur), produced by Rubin and featuring Henry on acoustic guitar and Rupert on electric and acoustic guitar, harmonica, and bass. The album also includes the talents of such boldface names as Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on drums, along with The Killers\u2019 Dave Keuning on strings and Faces and Small Faces legend Ian McLagan on keyboards.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "Edward Simon - Piano\nMarcos Granados - Flute\n\nTwo Venezuelan virtuosos perform a blend of South American music including favorites by the iconic Venezuelan singer/songwriter Sim\u00f3n D\u00edaz as well as Edward Simon\u2019s own Venezuelan Suite from his acclaimed album of the same name.

In short, it\u2019s a masterpiece.\u201d\n\nEdward Simon, a native of Venezuela, has made a name for himself over decades in America as a jazz improviser, composer-arranger, band leader and educator. DownBeat has called him \u201cone of the strongest pianists of his generation, with intuitive empathy and drum-like ingenuity,\u201d while Jazz Journal International has singled out \u201chis deep emotional statements\u201d as a composer and improviser. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area as a member of the all-star SFJAZZ Collective, he has been a Guggenheim Fellow along with being awarded multiple composition grants as part of the Chamber Music America\u2019s New Jazz Works initiative. Simon, a Yamaha artist, has recorded 15 albums as a leader or co-leader. His latest is Sorrows and Triumphs, released via Sunnyside Records in April 2018; the album was declared \u201cunmissable\u201d in Nate Chinen\u2019s Take Five column on WBGO.org, and the pianist was featured in an extensive DownBeat interview upon the disc\u2019s release. This follows Simon\u2019s 2016 album Latin American Songbook, which won him an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Jazz Album; a four-and-a-half-star DownBeat review also praised his fresh vision of classic Latin American songs as \u201cgrand and sophisticated.\u201d\n\nAnother key release for Simon was his 2014 Sunnyside album Venezuelan Suite, which saw the pianist blend the tuneful, buoyant sounds of his native country with the harmonically sophisticated, forward-looking manner of jazz. All About Jazz marveled: \u201cVenezuelan Suite\u2026 is the perfect confluence of Venezuelan ideals, jazz language and chamber-esque sophistication. In short, it\u2019s a masterpiece.\u201d One of Simon\u2019s most recent collaborative projects is the trio Steel House, with the pianist joined by bassist Scott Colley and drummer Brian Blade for a group that blends acoustic jazz improvisation with electronic-tinged atmospherics for an inviting, song-oriented sound.

Couple that with all their music friends joining in on the fun, and this new CD makes a very strong case for Northern California being the new torch-bearing center of the classic Chicago and Texas blues sound.\nSix stellar originals tell the couple\u2019s individual and combined personal histories in an honest and cosmic way.

They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is back at the lovely Empress Lounge.

With an uplifting, almost child-like singing voice, he moves seamlessly between guitar & violin, sometimes making tasteful use of live looping to enhance the listening experience.

On That\u2019s What I Heard, Robert celebrates the music of Curtis Mayfield, Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland, The Sensational Nightingales and more, alongside four newly written songs. Listen to the first single \u201cAnything You Want\u201d here (by Robert Cray), available now on all streaming services.\n\nCray and Jordan go way back, having met during the making of the Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll, in 1987. They started working together in 1999, when Jordan produced the Grammy-winning Take Your Shoes Off, and the recent Grammy-nominated LP, Robert Cray & Hi Rhythm. That\u2019s What I Heard is their sixth album. \u201cOnce you start working with Steve, it\u2019s kind of hard to get away from him,\u201d said Robert.\n\nThe music on That\u2019s What I Heard falls into two camps, the sweet and the funky. Of the former, \u201cYou\u2019re the One\u201d comes from the Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland songbook. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing where I feel you kind of gotta get out of your own head when you're covering one of your heroes,\u201d Cray explained. \u201cBobby\u2019s one of those. You just let yourself go, and do the song because you love it.\u201d\n\nDon Gardner\u2019s \u201cMy Baby Likes to Boogaloo\u201d and the Billy Sha-Rae minor hit, \u201cDo It\u201d are acknowledged rarities (the originals can be heard on the compilation, Groove & Grind: Rare Soul). \u201cDo It\u201d is leaner and meaner, the sort of bare-bones funk that defined the Detroit club sound in the early \u201970s with Sha-Rae, Dennis Coffey, and Earl Van Dyke. Cray\u2019s steamroller rendition gets a little extra push from guest guitarist Ray Parker, Jr., who played in Sha-Rae\u2019s band as a teen.\n\n\u201cBurying Ground\u201d is a sacred song from the Sensational Nightingales, inspired by Cray\u2019s youth, when Sundays on the stereo were reserved for his parents\u2019 gospel records. Curtis Mayfield wrote \u201cYou\u2019ll Want Me Back\u201d for Major Lance, and Cray wrote \u201cTo Be with You\u201d for his late friend, Tony Joe White. \u201cHot\u201d is another Cray original. \u201cAs for the lyrics, \u201cWe always say to ourselves, \u2018I\u2019m old, but I\u2019m hot,\u2019\u201d he said, and laughed. Spotted hanging around the studio, Steve Perry sang harmony vocals on \u201cPromises You Can\u2019t Keep,\u201d written by Steve Jordan, Kim Wilson and Danny Kortchmar.\n\n\u201cRobert is just a great person besides being extraordinary talent,\u201d adds Jordan. \u201cPeople gravitate to his guitar playing first, but I think he\u2019s one of the best singers I\u2019ve heard in my life. Not only because of his singing ability, but his interpretations. He\u2019s such an honest soul in my opinion.\u201d\n\nRobert\u2019s band features Richard Cousins (bass), Dover Weinberg (keyboards), Terence F.

There are more instrumental passages than on 'Valkyrja' (2013), and there are a lot of guitar and bass details,\" states guitarist/vocalist Heri Joensen. \"I really feel we've realized the vision we set out to create all those years ago, and as I listen through the album, I am satisfied with every aspect: the epicness, the intricacy, the melodies and harmonies, and the sheer heaviness of it. I love the whole atmosphere of it.\"\n\nKnown for their prolific nature - dropping their first five full-lengths in the space of just seven years - the six-year gap between Valkyrja and Hel is by far the longest between any two of their records. During that period the band toured hard, taking the album around the world, including a support run with Children Of Bodom in North America and an appearance on the 70,000 Tons Of Metal cruise. However, other factors played into this extended break between releases. \"We approached this one differently because I learned that if I continue doing albums in the way we had up to now, I would die from a heart attack before I'm 50!\" says Joensen. \"That's one of the reasons we changed our method and took such a long time on this one.\" That this tactic - which also includes more songwriting contributions from bassist/vocalist Gunnar Thomsen and guitarist Terji Skiben\u00e6s than on previous releases - has been beneficial is borne out in the finished product, which is perhaps more immersive than those that came before. \"Musically it leans a bit towards our album, 'Ragnarok' (2005),\" states Thomsen. \"It's a bit more epic and also much better worked through than any of our previous albums.\" It also marks the recording debut of drummer Tadeusz Rieckmann, who has manned the drum throne for T\u00fdr's live shows since 2016. \"We had some problems finding the right guy some years back, but Tadeusz is the man for the job,\" says Joensen. \"He's a very technically able drummer, but at the same time, he has a very natural old-school heaviness to his style, and he plays with deep emotion, which is just what we need.\"\n\nConceptually, the album is informed by a combination of mythology, personal experience and observations of current international events, making for a multifaceted experience that can be processed and understood on many levels. Starting not with a specific story to tell but with an atmosphere in mind, Joensen prefers not to disclose too much detail when it comes to lyrics, keen for listeners to have a chance to take what they want from the songs, though he provides a basic description of that which inspired him. \"Hel is the realm of death in Norse mythology, the underworld where those who die a natural death, not in battle, go. A bit confusingly, it is also the name of the goddess who rules over the same realm. She's the daughter of Loki and a terrifying creature to look upon.\" Two of the songs - \"Ragnars Kv\u00e6\u00f5i\" and \"\u00c1lvur Kongur\" - are traditional Faroese ballads and are as such sung in Joensen's native tongue. Followers of T\u00fdr will be aware that they have on numerous occasions strayed from English, which Joensen acknowledges as the \"language of metal\", though this time out it is only the ballads that feature non-English lyrics. \"If I have a good folky melody, I always have the thought that I should write the lyrics in Faroese, but I seldom have the time. The traditional songs come with lyrics, so it's just about picking out the verses I want to use.\" These tracks were in actuality selected even before the release of Valkyrja and have had a long gestation period, Joensen feeling that in adapting them they very much fit with the band's signature sound. \"I am always trying out melodies and chose 'Ragnars Kv\u00e6\u00f0i' first for the fascinating melody in the chorus, and secondly for the storyline. The other ballad I picked first because of the lyrics, which refer to Odin extensively, and secondly for the melody and chorus. I was very satisfied with the harmonies and epic feel of the arrangements I'd come up with, and to tell you the truth, I wish there were more songs of this kind on the album.\"\n\nHel was tracked entirely by Thomsen and Joensen, with sessions split between the latter's studio in S\u00f8ldarfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur, drums lain down at Jacob Hansen's studio in Denmark, Skiben\u00e6s working in his home studio, and some solos and bass details recorded while they were on the road in North America. \"The sessions took us a long time because we did it all on our own. But we gathered a lot of knowhow while doing it, so it will be a good reference for the future,\" states Thomsen. Joensen concurs, adding, \"It was a bit more relaxing than usual, which was good for me. It took some discipline, and creative people are not typically the most disciplined types. I am definitely not, so I guess it could have gone faster with someone else at the whip!\" That the delay in getting the record out means it's emerging in the twentieth year of T\u00fdr's existence is quite poignant. It has definitely not been an easy road to this point, with several members having come and gone, and those that remain having had to endure some very difficult periods, but despite all of it, they have managed to make it through, and achieved a great deal in the process. \"I did dream about becoming an internationally successful professional when I started. It's what I aimed at, but still it's a bit surreal that we've made it this far,\" Joensen admits. \"I didn't in my wildest dreams think I could put survive such misery and abject poverty that this career has lead me through. Still, here I am.\" Thomsen \"could not be prouder\" when he looks back at the string of records they have released, also acknowledging the ups and downs experienced along the way, but making an important point: \"We've done something nobody from where we're from has done before,\" he states plainly. \"But there's a lot more to come!\"\n\nKeep up to date with T\u00ddR at the following locations:\nhttp://www.tyr.fo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tyrband\nhttps://twitter.com/tyrband\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tyr_official\nhttps://www.youtube.com/tyrband\n\n\nBand History:\nProfession of the Christian Faith or Decapitation: This was the choice given by Sigmundur to his Faroese Viking compatriot Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu. And so it was that in 999 A.D., the Christianization of the small \u201cFaeroe Islands\u201d began, casting a veil of oblivion over the ancient Scandinavian gods and only leaving the relics of forgotten heathenry buried deep within the Christian ritual. Or so it was believed...\n\nExactly 999 years later, a small group fondly remembering the archaic gods and rites came together to form the Faroese Viking metal band, T\u00ddR. The one-armed God of War \u2014the bravest of all\u2014 became the eponym of the Nordic quartet. Yet T\u00ddR mastermind Heri Joensen is no war monger in disguise and points out that T\u00ddR (also known as the God of Justice) is also revered for first seeking the avenues of diplomacy\u2014an attribute that does not take away from this god of war\u2019s drive.\n\nA distinctive trademark that sets T\u00ddR apart from most other bands of the Viking metal genre is the authenticity of their music: \u201cTraditional music dating back to the Vikings, that is not preserved anywhere else in the world, not even in Iceland, is passed on in an oral tradition here and it is still alive and well. That is what we build our music on and draw great inspiration from,\u201d explains Joensen.\n\nAlmost every song is based on Faroese or Norwegian lore, and is riveted in the garb of the folk metal genre. Its approach unmistakably creates very true Viking metal.\n\nFollowing the release of a demo, the \u00d3lavur Riddararos single, full-length How Far to Asgard, six years of innumerable gigs, and several domestic television appearances, T\u00ddR\u2019s second full-length Eric the Red became the Islands\u2019 best-selling album, coming to the attention of Napalm Records, the label that finally made the album available worldwide in 2006.\n\nImmediately, the unique approach of T\u00ddR\u00b4s music, melting traditional Nordic songs and dances with Celtic influences, doom, heavy, and progressive metal found fans around the globe. \u201cHail to The Hammer\u201d became the hymn to the new generation of folk, pagan, and Viking metal fans.\n\nIn late 2006, T\u00ddR refined their trademark sound with Ragnarok. Technically brilliant and 100 percent authentic, Ragnarok was nothing less than a masterpiece within the true Viking metal genre. The Faroese band embarked on a European tour with Die Apokalyptischen Reiter and a few months later with AMON AMARTH. Though musically different, T\u00ddR gained legions of new fans, impressed by the four men on stage, who were able to turn every show into a demonstration of musical prowess.\n\nFestival appearances throughout Europe and continued touring followed until T\u00ddR enjoyed their biggest live triumph ever at the very over-crowded Wet Stage in Wacken.\n\nLand was released in 2008 and proved to be yet another milestone in the band\u2019s career. Traditional Faroese lyrics marked tracks such as \u201cG\u00e1tu R\u00edma,\u201d \u201cF\u00edpan Fagra\u201d and \u201cLokka T\u00e1ttur,\u201d and \u201cGandkv\u00e6\u00f0i Tr\u00f3ndar,\u201d which is a poem by J.H.O. Djurhuus about the Faroese chieftain Tr\u00f3ndur, who fought against the dying of the old beliefs and for the independence of the Faeroes. A video clip was produced to the fan favorite \u201cSinklars V\u00edsa.\u201d Land received overwhelming positive feedback and a new audience was able to experience the power of T\u00ddR for the first time.\n\nFollowing the release of Land, T\u00ddR embarked on numerous tours through Europe. One of the highlights was without a doubt the Aaskereia Festival tour with then label-mates Alestorm and Hollenthon. Thanks to their efforts, the band reached many new fans with their memorable concerts. 2008 ended with T\u00ddR being nominated as \u201cBand of the Year\u201d by the Faroese National TV and radio. However, the band had no time to rest on its laurels and embarked on yet another tour through North America in the spring of 2009.\n\nDespite their busy touring schedule, T\u00ddR worked on new songs recorded in early 2009. The band chose to produce the album on native soil. Jacob Hansen mixed the new material with finishing touches provided by the mastering experts at Finnvox. By the Light of the Northern Star met with great feedback from fans and critics alike. The new anthem \u201cHold the Heathen Hammer High\u201c was regarded as the legitimate successor to \u201cHail to the Hammer.\u201d After the release of the album By the Light of the Northern Star, the band played numerous concerts and festivals, as well as taking part in the 70.000 Tons of Metal cruise, while still finding the time to work on new material for their upcoming release.\n\nThe story of King Thrym, who dared steal Thor\u00b4s hammer \"Mjollnir,\" may set the lyrical stage on T\u00ddR's latest album, but it does not prevent them from covering more current topics like in the track \"Shadow of the Swastika.\" The Lay of Thrym follows the path of the band's previous releases by uniting classic heavy metal riffs with impressive drumming, traditional melodies, and powerful choruses. The result is a number of epic anthems, such as \"Take Your T\u00ddRant\" and \"Hall of Freedom,\" both of which will most certainly earn a permanent spot on T\u00ddR's future set lists. Frontman Heri Joensen continues to give T\u00ddR a unique and unmistakable edge with magnificent vocals and superb guitar work. Jacob Hansen was again responsible for recording, mixing, and mastering the album, complementing this fascinating Faeroese sound universe with finishing touches that allow every last detail to shine. The Lay of Thrym is a genuine Viking metal album that will undoubtedly secure T\u00ddR's hold on this genre with its heroic melodies and glorious riffs.\n\nValkyrja, the 7 full-length album from the Faroe Islands natives T\u00ddR, is a concept album with a story line based loosely around an nameless Viking age warrior who leaves his woman and goes off to impress the Valkyrie on the battlefield so that she may bring him to Valhalla, or to F\u00f3lkvangr, the home of Freyja\u2014the goddess associated with love, sexuality, beauty, fertility, gold, sorcery, war, and death. One can say the album is also indirectly about women and how they affect men and what men will do to impress and obtain women. Frontman and founder Heri Joensen goes on to explain; \u201cthe woman that the warrior leaves may represent the earthly women. Freyja, The Lady Of The Slain, may represent the perfection of Women, and the Valkyrie is the link between the two, taking men from earthly to godly women.\u201d\n\nRecorded at Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark with Jacob Hansen who handled production, mixing and mastering, the band began writing guitars and drums for Valkyrja over a year ago with melody lines and arrangements being handled in the studio. \u201cI had the story outline and approximate titles very early in the writing process, but only very late, maybe almost too late, did I write the actual lyrics,\u201d comments Heri Joensen. The band\u2019s drummer, K\u00e1ri Streymoy, parted ways with T\u00ddR after the band completed their US run on Pagan Fest and before they entered the studio so T\u00ddR enlisted George Kollias who stepped in to handle recording duties on Valkyrja. In terms of what the band hopes fans take away from the album, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen states \u201cI hope they will enjoy it and they like the new direction as well as (guitarist) Terji's bigger involvement in writing and George's drumming. We had a more upbeat direction without changing T\u00ddR's style.\u201d\n\nDiscography:\n\u00d3lavur Riddararos (2002)\nHow Far to Asgard (2002)\nEric the Red (2003)\nEric the Red re-released (2006)\nRagnarok (2006)\nLand (2008)\nHow Far to Asgard re-released (2008)\nBy the Light of the Northern Star (2009)\nThe Lay of Thrym (2011)\nValkyrja (2013)\nHel (2019)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "T\u00fdr ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10165861.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Classic Metal, Viking Metal, Progressive Metal, Death Metal, Classic Rock, Symphonic Metal, Folk Metal, Heavy Metal, Pagan Metal, Melodic Metal, Hard Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "With Hel, the Faroe Islands' T\u00fdr provide even more irrefutable evidence that they stand at the vanguard of Scandinavian metal.

Thanks to their efforts, the band reached many new fans with their memorable concerts. 2008 ended with T\u00ddR being nominated as \u201cBand of the Year\u201d by the Faroese National TV and radio. However, the band had no time to rest on its laurels and embarked on yet another tour through North America in the spring of 2009.\n\nDespite their busy touring schedule, T\u00ddR worked on new songs recorded in early 2009. The band chose to produce the album on native soil. Jacob Hansen mixed the new material with finishing touches provided by the mastering experts at Finnvox. By the Light of the Northern Star met with great feedback from fans and critics alike. The new anthem \u201cHold the Heathen Hammer High\u201c was regarded as the legitimate successor to \u201cHail to the Hammer.\u201d After the release of the album By the Light of the Northern Star, the band played numerous concerts and festivals, as well as taking part in the 70.000 Tons of Metal cruise, while still finding the time to work on new material for their upcoming release.\n\nThe story of King Thrym, who dared steal Thor\u00b4s hammer \"Mjollnir,\" may set the lyrical stage on T\u00ddR's latest album, but it does not prevent them from covering more current topics like in the track \"Shadow of the Swastika.\" The Lay of Thrym follows the path of the band's previous releases by uniting classic heavy metal riffs with impressive drumming, traditional melodies, and powerful choruses. The result is a number of epic anthems, such as \"Take Your T\u00ddRant\" and \"Hall of Freedom,\" both of which will most certainly earn a permanent spot on T\u00ddR's future set lists. Frontman Heri Joensen continues to give T\u00ddR a unique and unmistakable edge with magnificent vocals and superb guitar work. Jacob Hansen was again responsible for recording, mixing, and mastering the album, complementing this fascinating Faeroese sound universe with finishing touches that allow every last detail to shine. The Lay of Thrym is a genuine Viking metal album that will undoubtedly secure T\u00ddR's hold on this genre with its heroic melodies and glorious riffs.\n\nValkyrja, the 7 full-length album from the Faroe Islands natives T\u00ddR, is a concept album with a story line based loosely around an nameless Viking age warrior who leaves his woman and goes off to impress the Valkyrie on the battlefield so that she may bring him to Valhalla, or to F\u00f3lkvangr, the home of Freyja\u2014the goddess associated with love, sexuality, beauty, fertility, gold, sorcery, war, and death. One can say the album is also indirectly about women and how they affect men and what men will do to impress and obtain women. Frontman and founder Heri Joensen goes on to explain; \u201cthe woman that the warrior leaves may represent the earthly women. Freyja, The Lady Of The Slain, may represent the perfection of Women, and the Valkyrie is the link between the two, taking men from earthly to godly women.\u201d\n\nRecorded at Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark with Jacob Hansen who handled production, mixing and mastering, the band began writing guitars and drums for Valkyrja over a year ago with melody lines and arrangements being handled in the studio. \u201cI had the story outline and approximate titles very early in the writing process, but only very late, maybe almost too late, did I write the actual lyrics,\u201d comments Heri Joensen. The band\u2019s drummer, K\u00e1ri Streymoy, parted ways with T\u00ddR after the band completed their US run on Pagan Fest and before they entered the studio so T\u00ddR enlisted George Kollias who stepped in to handle recording duties on Valkyrja. In terms of what the band hopes fans take away from the album, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen states \u201cI hope they will enjoy it and they like the new direction as well as (guitarist) Terji's bigger involvement in writing and George's drumming. We had a more upbeat direction without changing T\u00ddR's style.\u201d\n\nDiscography:\n\u00d3lavur Riddararos (2002)\nHow Far to Asgard (2002)\nEric the Red (2003)\nEric the Red re-released (2006)\nRagnarok (2006)\nLand (2008)\nHow Far to Asgard re-released (2008)\nBy the Light of the Northern Star (2009)\nThe Lay of Thrym (2011)\nValkyrja (2013)\nHel (2019)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "MH The Verb ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8037746.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "[Multi-Media Hip Hop Artist], MH the Verb", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Sofar Sounds", "moreBioInfo": "I am a whiskey drinking, boat shoe wearing, MC/DJ/Producer who currently resides on a Megabus between a pair of imitation BeatsbyDre Headphones.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "500 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Sonam\u00f3 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9317059.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.437364, 37.774222], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Acid Jazz, Funk", "Time": "4:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Madrone Art Bar", "moreBioInfo": "If Jamiroquai and Stevie Wonder were Italians, they would sound like Sonam\u00f3.\n\nWith a dynamic, passionate blend of melodic lines shot through with hefty doses of R&B, funk, and acid jazz, Sonam\u00f3 music is both danceable yet introspective, at once familiar yet exotic, intense yet energetic, romantic and yet somehow carefree. One of the strongest characteristics of Sonam\u00f3 is their high energy that\u2019s well expressed in their memorable live performances.\n\nThe San Francisco band, whose roots are spread all over the world, released on August 2019 their latest new single, their funky fresh version of the 1956 classic Tu Vu\u00f3 F\u00e0 L\u2019Americano (You Want To Be American)\u2026but with a TWIST!\n\nSonam\u00f3 flipped the script and replaced the lyrics, so their version is called\u2026 \u201dYou Wanna Be an ITALIANO\u201d.

As a passionate musician from Italy, Pinto searched for inspiration in his new city by exploring its eclectic scene and open-mindedness. As Pinto mentioned: \u201c[...] my experience in the United States completely changed me. I had to reconsider all my values and understand that there are many ways of doing things and seeing things. That\u2019s what I call the American miracle: a huge diversity that brings the best part of all of us\u201d.\nThose feelings of freedom and love in Pinto\u2019s journey came to life with Sonam\u00f3 after the meeting with creative guitarist Trent Berry who says: \u201d[...] as a kid growing up in the midwest it was like discovering a lost cousin almost like a parallel evolution, if American funk is like Nascar then Italian funk is like Formula 1\u201d.\n\n\nThe name Sonam\u00f3 is inspired by an album of Pino Daniele (E Sona Mo\u2019) that means \u201cand play now\u201d, It is sometimes used among musicians in Southern Italian as a slang term meaning, \u201cshow me what you got!\u201d and boy, do they ever!", "otherInfo": "If Jamiroquai and Stevie Wonder were Italians, they would sound like Sonam\u00f3.\n\nWith a dynamic, passionate blend of italian melodic lines shot through with hefty doses of R&B, funk, and acid jazz, Sonam\u00f3 music is both danceable yet introspective, at once familiar yet exotic, intense yet energetic, romantic and yet somehow carefree.\n\nwww.sonamomusic.com"}]
