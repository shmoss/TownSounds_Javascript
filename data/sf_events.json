Worth, brought down the house at Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Draper James fashion line launch party, opened up for songstress Demi Lovato and contributed their talents to an annual Country Music Hall of Fame fundraiser event. Jared sums it up well by explaining, \u201cWe\u2019re three guys who have something to prove. We love what we're doing, we're real and we're going to carve out a place in music history for ourselves.\u201d 3 guys who love singing country music.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose. Or, as Hubbard put it best to Plankenhorn way back at the start of his journey, \u201cThere\u2019s your proof.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Code Orange LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10370124.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Hardcore", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "down we go... our new album \u2018U N D E R N E A T H\u2019 is out 3/13. pre-order/pre-save at https://codeorange.lnk.to/underneath. title track available to watch and stream everywhere now.", "otherInfo": "YOU AND YOU ALONE 004\nv i r t u a l p e r f o r m a n c e: joe + mudman in the\ncold.metal.place"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dryes LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9957553.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Alt-country, Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The first time the public got a taste of country duo The Dryes was in May 2018.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "\u25aa\ufe0fABOUT THE SERIES\n\"All Dressed Up & Nowhere to Show\" is a virtual concert series presented by SPACE.

His second album, Misguided Roses, spawned I'll Be, a major single in 1998. Two more albums (Messenger and Far From Over) followed, but at the end of 2001, he split from Lava. In 2003 he released a collection of acoustic versions of songs both old and new called The Austin Sessions via ATC Records, a Nashville-based independent record label (at which McCain was the first artist signed following its creation in 2001). Mid-2004 saw the arrival of his first studio album in three years, entitled Scream & Whisper, which was released on another indie label, DRT Entertainment.\n\nHe has released two DVDs to date. The first was through ATC records in late 2002, called Mile Marker: Songs and Stories from the Acoustic Highway, and it consisted of interviews, live performances, and other material. The other was in late 2004, Tinsel & Tap Shoes. It was his first live concert DVD, recorded at The House of Blues in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nA new CD was released in April, 2006 titled, Lost in America.

Sara has previously been featured at Variety, Huffington Post, Yahoo! Music, PopMatters, Magnet Magazine, the homepage of Apple Music, and more. She\u2019s appeared in numerous films and TV shows, including The Wonder Years and Frasier, while her songs have been featured in Grey\u2019s Anatomy and in a national Chevy campaign. Sara has shared the stage with Ben Folds, Juliana Hatfield, Ben Lee, Inara George, Neil Halstead, and Lissie, and provided backing vocals for Moby on The Tonight Show and for The Dandy Warhols and Mojave 3 on KCRW\u2019s Morning Becomes Eclectic.\n\nWild & Precious Life was co-produced by Melson, multi-instrumentalist/guitarist Danny Hechter (Badflower, Jordan McGraw) and Rick Parker (Lord Huron, Joseph Arthur, BRMC, Jeremy & The Harlequins). Hechter brought in bassists Sean Sobash (Dominic Fike) and Nick Diiorio (Jordan McGraw), drummer Jonas Streffer, second guitarist Jake Faun, and violinist Koi Anunta (Jules Galli). Violinist Kerenza Peacock (Adele) also added to the recordings, with additional production and remixing by Eric Breiner of PeachMusicLA.\n\nWritten and performed on piano and guitar, Sara\u2019s songs reflect on hard-won lessons and her tireless journey toward self-acceptance. \u201cIt\u2019s high time I learn to love myself before I\u2019m dead,\u201d she sings in the soulful and heartfelt \u201cComing Out\u201d \u2014 a defiant, weary, and yet serene \u201cI-don\u2019t-give-a-f-ck\u201d anthem for anyone who is ready to shed the mask and step fully into one\u2019s authentic self. \u201cState of Ease,\" written in deep meditation, is a prayer for transcendence \u2014 the quest to maintain a state of equanimity in the face of life\u2019s challenges. \u201cNo one can escape pain, physical or emotional,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we choose to react.\u201d Ethereal and swelling vocals, haunting piano, and swirling guitar lines evoke the bliss of flight, peace and surrender. \u201cSame River\u201d, inspired by the quote from Greek philosopher Heraclitus, No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river, and he's not the same man, is a reminder that the only constant is change -- in the fleeting, morphing moment.\n\nWith classical training at the age of eight, Sara began to gravitate toward the melancholy darkness of Chopin and the fanciful romanticism of Debussy. The daughter of two professors, she grew up in an intellectual Jewish household in a small college town in Indiana. Surrounded by cows and cornfields, her parents\u2019 home was an oasis of culture and worldliness, with books lining the shelves from floor to ceiling, and the best record collection in the neighborhood.\n\nShe graduated from Harvard with an English degree and initially moved out West to become an actor. However, after one too many traumatizing \u201c#MeToo\u201d encounters, Sara went \u201con strike,\u201d as she puts it. \u201cI just refused to go out on any more meetings or auditions. I lived on residuals for a while and spent all day playing guitar and piano, and writing songs. That was when I decided I was going to take that turn from the acting into music. It\u2019s not like that stuff doesn\u2019t exist in the music industry, because it does; but at least you have creative control. You can stand behind a finished product \u2014 your song \u2014 and not have to rely solely on what you look like, or your perceived value, or lack thereof, as a sexual object.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief marriage to Justin Webb, son of famed songwriter Jimmy Webb, the loss of a pregnancy at five months, and an ensuing divorce, Sara struggled with depression, and turned to yoga for salvation, developing a serious daily practice that began to inform her songwriting with new revelations about surrender, acceptance, growth and change. It also slowed her anxious breath to a fluid wave. \u201cYoga is like peeling an onion, gradually removing layers that cover up your true essence. There may be some tears in the process, but it\u2019s delicious, good for you, and worth it.\u201d\n\nThe EP reflects Sara\u2019s spiritual seeking, a deep understanding of her own mortality, and an urgency to make the most of life while she\u2019s here. \u201cWalk Softly\u201d is a plaintive letter of life instructions, penned to herself, invoking the perspective of her older, wiser self advising its younger, more distracted and insecure counterpart: \u201cPlease be gentle, please be kind; you can\u2019t read anybody\u2019s mind. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through. So don\u2019t be quick to your defense, \u2018cause we all hide behind pretense; and it\u2019s got nothing to do with you.\" Title track \u201cWild & Precious Life\u201d inspired by the line in the Mary Oliver poem, The Summer Day (\u201cTell me, What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?\u201d) is a rousing, anthemic call to fulfill one\u2019s full potential, despite the naysayers.\n\nSara will tour in support of the new EP, both solo and with a stripped-down version of her beloved band. She muses that, just as one can never step into the same river twice, her shows take on different forms. \u201cThere is a power in connecting one-on-one with an audience that is its own special magic,\u201d Sara says. \u201cHearing my songs come to life around me with a full band is euphoric. They\u2019re two different experiences, both for me and for the audience, and I live for both.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aaron Goodvin LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/2999240.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aaron Goodvin\u2019s new Warner Music Canada / Reviver Records release \u2014 V \u2014 is available now.

As he prepares the release of Us Time, LaRue reflects on this important connection he has fostered with his fans over his 15-plus years of touring. Together, LaRue and his fans have culled together a \u201cfavorite live song set\u201d that is dedicated to his loyal and growing fan base. LaRue is known for his real life, thinking man\u2019s music.\n\nUS TIME is a collection of songs from the native Texan who now resides in Oklahoma reflecting on his own dreams that openly shares with his longtime fans. \u201cThis project is a tribute to my fans. We have developed a strong relationship and I appreciate all of them,\u201d says LaRue. \u201c Together, we have built a compilation of fan favorites from the live shows that reflect the complexion of our time together in music, it is simply our US Time, \u201c he continues. This sentiment rings even louderafter LaRue took a hiatus from touring this summer to re-center his life that seemed to be lost.\n\nLaRue says, \u201cBeing able to record such timeless songs as \u201cEmpty Glass,\u201d \u201cInto the Mystic\u201d and \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d aside some of original tunes, all selected by my fans make me feel validated as an artist and hopefully it gives the fans exactly what they are looking for.\u201d\n\nBeing able to connect with fans the way we can today is mind blowing to LaRue. When this journey started over 15 years ago, communication was restricted mainly to the stage, written letters and before show meet and greets. Today\u2019s instant social media connection is what helped generate this collection of songs. \u201cI just kept a list of songs that fans would either request via Twitter and Facebook or yell to me on stage,\u201d says LaRue. \u201cUs Time is a very collaborative effort with them. Also, having RS Fields as the producer on this project was a good call. This is our first time working together and he totally nailed the production and we totally were in sync on how it should sound. I am very happy with the end result, it feels live and it feels real, and that is what music is all about,\u201d he continued.\n\nIndependently charged, LaRue has sold over 300,000 records over his career and plays 200-plus shows a year. His songs have seen the top of the charts, most recently his hit \u201cGolden Shackles\u201d from his eOne Music debut, Aviator, in 2014.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mark Wills LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10316169.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Reader\u2019s Digest version of Mark Wills\u2019 story makes it clear he\u2019s an award-winning singer\u2019s singer. His matchless phrasing, passionate and meaningful delivery and right-on-the money vocals make each and every song he performs come alive. Like a picture perfect painting, Wills\u2019 music is a vocal work of art that walks right off the canvas and into the hearts of country music lovers alike.\n\nBringing the Wills\u2019 dimension to some of the greatest songs ever written, he\u2019s not necessarily become known for being trendy, hip or even on the cutting edge, but rather and simply as a damn good singer!\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a good storyteller to make a son g meaningful. Whether romantic or \u2018reality,\u2019 my focus is on the music delivery to make it my own for the people who listen\u2014so that they can make it their own.\u201d\n\nAnd the people listen...\n\nHis list of accolades is his testament. Mark Wills is a multi-platinum selling country music star with eight top 10 hits to his name including \u201c19 Something,\u201d \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Laugh At Me;\u201d all of which received nominations for Single, Song and Video of the Year by the Country Music Association. Wills won the Academy of Country\nMusic's award for Top New Male Vocalist in 1998. In 2002, his single \u201c19 Something\u201d spent six consecutive weeks at No. 1, was Billboard\u2019s top country hit of the year and was the second most-played song of the decade in 2009.\n\n\u2026and that\u2019s just a chapter in Mark Wills\u2019 life story.\n\nSince garnering his Top New Male Vocalist recognition in 1998, Wills has become a staple in country music, like salt and pepper on a table; the chapters may have changed, but the story continues. The father of two daughters, a husband and the head of household, Mark\u2019s role in life and music are one in the same.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019ve seen all sides of me! I\u2019ve become more aware of who I am not only as an artist, but as a father, a husband and a friend\u2026and as a dad, I want to put out music my children can listen to; all in all, I take more ownership in it.\u201d\n\nHis ownership is made evident in his newest collection of recordings on the CD entitled LOOKING FOR AMERICA; an assortment of tunes Mark describes as different, yet the same.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA is a project with no \u2018sacrifices.\u2019 With titles like \u201cSmoking Gun,\u201d \u201cWhere Did I Lose You,\u201d \u201cA Whole World\u201d and \u201cRocking The Country,\u201d the tracks are not just about a rhyme and a hook, they\u2019re a menagerie of people-stories--a musical exhibition of heart-heavy, romantic, comedic all-American existence with apple pie flavor. Describing the hue of the music, Wills colors his music \u201cdark blue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of many personalities with a lot that I want to say. There\u2019s a fun, down-home side of me, and then there\u2019s an emotional, serious side. I think LOOKING FOR AMERICA, topically, is a human interest story of love, tragedy and life\u2019s unexpected.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has ever seen him in concert, or has met with him personally, knows that inside this humble, good ol' boy, country singer dwells a soul who just wants to speak to and for all with his music. LOOKING FOR AMERICA delivers music with a no-holds-barred edge softened with a trademarked tenor vocal that will capture the attention of music lovers from every genre from first cut to last.\n\nLOOKING FOR AMERICA clearly raises the flag to demonstrate the responsibility he feels to Americans alike, and specifically our military, with the title cut and \u201cCrazy Being Home.\u201d\n\nWills has made more seven trips to entertain our troops; he is familiar with the places they\u2019ve been. His trips have taken him to Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. He has also performed at several events for the Champions for Champions Organization, the USO\nand a variety of Fallen Soldier Charities here in the U.S. Having become personally acquainted with the faces of our brothers and sisters of the military, LOOKING FOR AMERICA is dedicated in part to these brave individuals.\n\n\"First of all, it's a privilege to provide a little joy and entertainment for these people.

He has aligned with USA Cares to launch a national awareness campaign surrounding the severity of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Since 2007, Mark has been the\nspokesperson for the Children\u2019s Miracle Network and its annual celebrations.\n\nAs an active representative, he accompanies miracle children to Walt Disney World and then to Washington each year as part of a national awareness campaign; the children enjoy lunch with Congress and a trip to the White House to meet with the President.\n\nTurning the page from bringing all-American music to life to his own brush with death, Wills was caught by surprise by an unexpected, eye-opening crisis. In October 2010, Mark experienced what felt like a \u201cpoke\u201d in his side that was followed by flu-like symptoms. A visit to the doctor took him straight to the emergency room. \u201cThe nurse said, \u2018we have to admit you immediately,\u2019 I said, \u2018I need to go home to let the girls know,\u2019 her response to me was, \u2018You don\u2019t have the time.\u201d Mark suffered from an intestinal infection that could have taken his life, but he pulled through with a nine-inch long scar to remind him of its value.\n\n\u201cIt was a dire circumstance and it gave me a whole new perspective in all aspects of my life.\u201d\n\nA man whose appetite for life surpasses what most people can only dream of \u2013 a dedicated parent, philanthropist, outdoorsman, jokester \u2013 but, more than anything, else Mark Wills is an artist and, behind the artist, is an even better singer.\n\n\u201cWhen the story comes to \u2018The End,\u2019 I just want to be remembered as a great singer - who sang great songs \u2013 and used his talents to not only speak to people but was the voice for many.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AHI LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6472095.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Alternative, Alt-folk, Indie Soul, R&b, Soul, R&b/soul, Indie, Rnb-soul", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With a voice like \u201cgravel on silk\u201d, indie-soul/alt-folk songwriter AHI (pronounced \u201ceye\u201d) is a rare talent with the keen ability to deliver a story with the ease and familiarity of an old friend. Favouring passion over precision, it's easy to see why comparisons to Richie Havens, Ray LaMontagne and Tracy Chapman are common for this soulful troubadour. From humble beginnings in Brampton, Ontario, AHI independently toured over 100,000 miles, through the vast woodlands of Canada and the neon lights of Nashville, to the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and eventually beyond the Atlantic to the brick lanes of London. Along the way, he has recorded with leading acoustic sessions across the UK and Europe, but none has been more viewed than a simple home video of his stunning rendition of Bob Marley\u2019s \u2018No Woman No Cry\u2019, filmed in a London alleyway and accompanied by the sweet harmonies of his three-year-old daughter. The video caught the attention of the Marley family who featured it on the official BobMarley.com website and sent AHI a personalized note from Mrs. Rita Marley herself \u2013 an unparalleled experience for an artist who cites Bob Marley as his greatest musical inspiration. Soon after, AHI returned to find his Indie Soul EP (2014) was chosen one of CBC Radio One\u2019s top 10 records of the year, and he has since been recognized and awarded by Folk Alliance International, Nashville Songwriters Association International, the Songwriters Association of Canada, and the Canada Council for the Arts, among others. For his debut full-length We Made It Through The Wreckage (2017), AHI has collaborated with CMA winning producer Eric Masse (Miranda Lambert) to create what Masse has called an entirely \"new genre\", blending folk, soul and rock, and topping it off with a vocal performance to be expected from a seasoned powerhouse rather than an indie debut. The feel-good single Ol' Sweet Day broke the Billboard Spotify Viral 50 Chart and hit #34 on the U.S. Viral 50 without any promotion or marketing. The track took off on playlists worldwide and surpassed 1 million streams; a rare feat for an artist yet to make his mark. Now a 2017 finalist in the Allan Slaight JUNO Master Class, it\u2019s not hard to see why AHI is one of Canada\u2019s most promising emerging acts.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What! The Good, the Mad, and the Ugly\u201d, an edited compilation of the band\u2019s fan club magazine spanning 10 years from 1994 to 2004.\n\nAnd still the \u2018Madly In Anger With The World\u2019 tour continued, selling out venues right through to it\u2019s final date in San Jose, California on November 29, 2004.\n\nThey did publicly state that the majority of 2005 would be spent re-charging those creative and mental batteries, and true to their word it was a quiet year, except for two little hometown gigs with the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in November. We all knew an entire year would not pass without at least a sighting of the guys!\n\nWith batteries re-charged after the two shows with the Stones, the guys hit the studio in early 2006 to start writing a new album and were excited to announce that they would be working with a new producer, Rick Rubin. The spring and summer found them escaping from the studio once again with shows in South Africa (their first ever visit to the continent!), Europe, Japan and Korea. \u201cThe New Song\u201d made its debut in Berlin, Germany on June 6 to give us all a little taste of things to come in 2007 with the remainder of the year scheduled for more writing and jamming.", "otherInfo": "#MetallicaMondays"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sarah Aili Music LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9796222.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Americana Folk Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer and Songwriter, Mostly in Nashville, TN sometimes elsewhere.", "otherInfo": "Since we are homebound, I've been making the best of it and playing Facebook Live shows every Monday at 8pm CST!

After working steadily for over a decade with many marquee jazz and pop artists, Hawley launched his solo career with his breakthrough 2016 debut album, Just the Beginning, which featured three chart-topping smooth jazz singles including \"35th Street,\" \"Joy Ride,\" and \"I Don't Mind.\" He followed that up with the #1 single \"Can You Feel It\" off of his 2nd project Double Vision. Along with performing, the guitarist has a Doctorate of Musical Arts from the University of Southern California, and balances his time between playing live and teaching at places like Musician's Institute, Chaffey College, and Saddleback College.\n\nA native of Portland, Oregon, Hawley started playing music at age eight, first taking piano lessons per his mother's request, and then adding guitar lessons a year later. As a teenager, he played in church, toured with a bluegrass ensemble, and led his own blues band. Also during high school, a friend made him a mixtape which included George Benson's 1976 hit song \"Breezin',\" and ignited his enduring love of contemporary jazz. In 2002, he relocated to Los Angeles where he attended the University of Southern California, eventually earning his Bachelor's, Master's, and doctorate degrees in music. Since graduating, he has played in a variety of live and studio settings with a bevy of pop, jazz, and R&B artists including Natalie Cole, Jennifer Lopez, Dave Koz, Brian Culbertson, Rick Braun, Gerald Albright, Manhattan Transfer, Peabo Bryson, Euge Groove, and many more.\n\nAlthough he had originally planned to record a solo album in 2005, the abundance of live and session opportunities kept him busy. It also afforded him time to build a strong following, and in 2015 he signed with Kalimba Records. A year later, he released his full-length debut Just the Beginning, which featured guest appearances by Culberson, Albright, Groove, Eric Darius, and Michael Lington. The album performed well, producing three number one hits including \"35th St.,\" which spent five weeks on top of the Billboard Smooth Jazz Chart. Hawley spent much of the next year touring in support of the album before joining Koz on tour in 2018. That same year, he returned with his sophomore album, Double Vision. Included on the album were contributions by Jeff Lorber, Darren Rahn, Marcus Anderson, Julian Vaughan, and others.

In more ways than one.\n\n\"We love to expose people to sounds they might not have heard before,\" explains violinist and bandleader Chris McKhool, summarizing the mission statement of the ground-breaking and acclaimed world music ensemble. \"And we love collaborating with other artists.\"\n\nOver the past dozen years and six albums, McKhool and his bandmates \u2014 co-founding guitarist Kevin Lalibert\u00e9, bassist Drew Birston, Cuban percussionist Rosendo \u2018Chendy\u2019 Leon and second guitarist Eddie Paton \u2014 have excelled at both. Thrilling listeners around North America with their genre-hopping fusion of Celtic reels, flamenco, Gypsy jazz, Arabic, Cuban, and South Asian rhythms, Sultans of String celebrate diversity and creativity with warmth and virtuosity. And they often do it with artists such as Paddy Moloney and The Chieftains, Richard Bona, Benoit Bourque (Bottine Souriante), Nikki Yanofsky, Alex Cuba, Ruben Blades, Crystal Shawanda and Ken Whiteley.\n\nWith their historic and visionary seventh album Refuge (coming in 2020), McKhool and co. bring their unique brand of musical synergy and collaboration into the studio like never before. Their most ambitious, diverse, inclusive and passionately political album, Refuge puts the Toronto-based Sultans face-to-face with a VIP roster of artists from around the globe \u2014 including American banjo master Bela Fleck, Israeli vocalist Yasmin Levy and others, like Iraqi violinist Imah Al Taha and Iranian santur master Amir Amiri, who have fled the peril and persecution of their homelands for the safer shores of North America.\n\n\"This is a project that is centred around the positive contributions of refugees and new immigrants to U.S.A. and Canada,\" says McKhool, whose Lebanese grandfather stowed away on a ship bound for North America a century ago. \"We are bringing in special guests that are newcomers to this land, as well as global talents that have been ambassadors for peace. We wish to celebrate the successes of those who make the journey here, and bring their extraordinary talents with them. We hope that the kinds of conversations we can have as musicians can provide a model for peace that our politicians and citizens find inspiration from.\"\n\nThat inspiration could not be summed up more clearly than on Refuge's gorgeously evocative and powerful first single I Am a Refugee, co-starring Somali poet and multi-media artist Ifrah Mansour, who now makes her home in the Twin Cities. \"I wrote the poem for me, for my community, and for those that are yearning for change, those yearning to deepen their empathy,\" explains Mansour. \"Writing the poem was a way to unleash some pain that I could name finally \u2013 I wrote it because I was so frustrated with so many people sending me emails and asking me what I thought about the travel ban, the first time our American government here shared the first travel ban. And that an artist\u2019s job is to draw that hope, especially in a time of deep hopelessness.\"\n\nLike most of the collaborations on Refuge, I Am a Refugee came to life in the studio, with Sultans of String and their guests composing and creating together. But no matter how they began, they all ended the same: with all the artists recording together at Jukasa, a world-class recording facility on the Six Nations reserve between Toronto and Buffalo.\n\n\"We knew we had to do it this way,\" McKhool stresses. \"We couldn't make an album honouring refugees and do it long-distance. But having everyone in the room at the same time made it extremely challenging, both from a logistical and technical standpoint. But the results certainly made it worthwhile.\"\n\nOf course, Sultans of String have never taken the easy road. Since releasing their debut album Luna in 2007, they have continually strived to make each chart-topping album more original and meaningful than the last. That includes working with an orchestra (2013's Symphony), teaming with Pakistani sitarist Anwar Khurshid (2015's Subcontinental Drift) and even crafting a world-music holiday album (2017's Christmas Caravan), which landed them on the Billboard charts and the New York Times. Their ambition and work ethic have garnered them multiple awards and accolades, including three Juno nominations, first place in the International Songwriting Competition (out of 15,000 entries), three Canadian Folk Music Awards, and countless other honours.\n\nTheir live resum\u00e9 is similarly stellar. Equally at home in a concert hall, jazz club or festival setting, the Sultans have gigged at the legendary club Birdland in New York, the renowned Celtic Connections Festival in the U.K. and the San Jose Jazz Festival. They have performed with symphonies across Canada and the U.S., and played live on BBC TV, Irish National Radio, World Cafe and SiriusXM in Washington. No matter the venue, the goal is the same, McKhool says.\n\n\"I've always wanted our concerts to be a place where everyone feels welcome.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

You did? Boy oh boy.\n\nThe metronome reference was but a musical in-joke before: now it contains more meaning.

It understands that while we all ultimately return to the goo from whence we came, time marches on furiously, like a bull aiming for a matador. Your last breath will be another click on the machine.\n\nMetronomy Forever in name represents a similar ethos: something looking backwards and forwards simultaneously, like Janus, something fated and eternal. You were made from dust and to dust you will return, that sort of thing.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is when you\u2019re making music and you enter a world where you have achieved some sort of celebrity no matter how large or small you start to think about yourself in terms of legacy and what you\u2019re going to leave behind,\u201d says Mount. \u201cAnd then you realise that\u2019s limited to the interest people have in you.

Its length is born from a desire for breathing room, from not wanting to stuff the hits together like a bouquet of petrol station roses. In between the sauna-sweat-soaked funk of songs like It\u2019s Automatic, and the beach funeral of Walking In The Dark, lie pretty, glistening ambient tracks. It evokes the feeling of being sat in a nursing home, Swiss-cheese-brained, recalling joyous flashes of a past life while the fugue states of comforting confusion wash over you.\n\nIt also comes from a desire to replicate the feeling of listening to the radio, with sumptuous songs of different types and styles helping lighten your mood, and stifle retches as you inhale scrambled egg steam from the saucepan you\u2019re scrubbing. \u201cThe radio never stops,\u201d as Joe puts it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how emotionally deep the music that comes on is, it\u2019s entirely your situation that gives the music it\u2019s emotional leaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I was concentrating on trying to make these snappy songs, and when they were all sat together it didn\u2019t make for some impressive thing. It wasn\u2019t until I started thinking about the past several years, realising that in that time there\u2019ve been periods of drifting, and looking around for ideas. When I started including these bits of instrumental music and bits of sound, to which I genuinely felt some kind of connection, I put them in amongst these little flowers.\u201d\n\nFlowers are apt metaphor. Mount has moved away from the bustle of his former Parisian home to take up residence atop a hill in the garden of England. It was a necessary change, he says, and one that has soldered a bond with him and nature.\n\n\u201cI think it has everything to do with me at the moment, being in this environment \u2013 and I literally mean the environment. I feel properly more connected with nature. And I\u2019m embracing myself getting into it, because I think it\u2019s a really important part of being a person \u2013 and I haven\u2019t even read that Sapiens book.\u201d\n\nAnd a good thing he hasn\u2019t, as it seems Sapiens has been widely discredited by academics the world over.\n\nMetronomy Forever is a record that exudes a green tranquillity. Mount was concerned that the relative happiness of his existence might stifle his creativity, having no great tragedy to draw from, but discovered the opposite was true.\n\n\u201cTo be jealous of having that stuff going on is a bit dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cI look at successful musicians who, as they get older, struggle to remain relevant. I\u2019m at this point where I feel like, my attitude towards what I do is healthy. With this record I wanted to make a very pure expression of what I\u2019m about right now, and I think for me that makes for better music.\u201d\n\nAnd while the music itself promotes a sense of calm joy, it\u2019s in the lyrics that we remember that even idyllic circumstances require their own maintenance, an oiling of the cogs to keep them crunching along. Mount reminds us of this on Lately, desperately singing \u201cThat is love and it's hard to do, it's a job for two. What do I do if I don't get nothing from you?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the physical space and distance from stress and life on the Rue De Dogshit in the French capital that has had its effect on the creative process. \u202fMount spent much of the last four years working with Robyn on her acclaimed and deeply personal record Honey. 48 months of vicarious agony was exhausting, but ultimately extremely fulfilling.\n\n\u201cIn the space of time since the last Metronomy record I\u2019ve had a very large part in writing an album based on a traumatic experience for her. I knew the whole experience was going to be this massive cathartic thing. When it got to the point of finishing, I remember telling her how good it was and how people are really going to respond to it in the way you want them to. Working with someone and being able to tell someone that is quite an enjoyable thing, being able to know that everything\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a nice feeling to have.\u201d\n\nThose glimmers of emotional, intense, carnal mania seem to have rubbed off on Mount in their own way, too. On Sex Emoji, the subconscious throbbing purple of the erotic digitised aubergine comes to life, a refrain of \u2018love, honey, sex, money\u2019 sang in a coital squeal.\n\nSalted Caramel Ice Cream brings this to the fore too, but more in the vein of Lipps Inc\u2019s Funkytown, and evokes the sapid pleasure and delights of love, but also the panics and anxieties (\u2018Oh god, she\u2019s coming, don\u2019t look up\u2019).\n\nBut when the shagging is over you\u2019re left only with the despair of your sweaty reflection. The moments of pain and sadness on Metronomy Forever are just as real, but also surmountable, much like most of the torture of existence ultimately is. It\u2019s the scope of experience of someone who has decided that agony, while perhaps a good palette from which to scrape your paints, is just not really that much fun. We\u2019re here for a good time, not a long time, and, as Homer Simpson once said, \u201cYou could wake up dead tomorrow.\u201d Get on your hands and knees, plunge your fingers in the soil and scream thanks at the moon for making the waves crash warm foam at the feet of our children.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tom Lumley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8448224.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tom Lumley is a Indie singer/songwriter originally from Cambridgeshire.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose. Or, as Hubbard put it best to Plankenhorn way back at the start of his journey, \u201cThere\u2019s your proof.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join me from Vancouver Island every Monday night!

That tireless dedication to his craft is what has earned him a Grammy nomination, the chance to perform at world-renowned festivals, and acclaim from the titans of the industry.\n\nHailing from Stockholm, Alesso won over his country from the very start of his career. His second single as the lead artist, 2012\u2019s \u201cCalling (Losing My Mind)\u201d with the legendary Swedish House Mafia\u2019s Sebastian Ingrosso and Grammy award-winning OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, was certified 2x Platinum in Sweden while also reaching no. 1 on Billboard\u2019s US Hot Dance Club Songs.\n\nHe consistently released remixes, including the Alesso Remix to \u201cPressure\u201d by Nadia Ali, Starkillers, and Alex Kenji which was named the \u201ctune of 2011\u201d by Kaskade en route to a nomination for Best Progressive Track at the International Dance Music Awards.\n\nWhile continuing to release remixes, Alesso was fine-tuning his debut album Forever. In 2013, he released \u201cIf I Lose Myself\u201d with OneRepublic which was certified 4x Platinum in Sweden and \u201cUnder Control\u201d with Calvin Harris featuring Hurts which was certified Gold in the United States.\n\nAlesso\u2019s ascension was sped up with the success of 2014\u2019s \u201cHeroes (We Could Be)\u201d featuring Tove Lo. With his production genius and honest songwriting on full display, the track became a worldwide hit. Again, he reached no. 1 on Billboard\u2019s US Dance Club Songs and no. 11 on the Top 40. It was certified Platinum in the US.\n\nAlesso has established himself as an entertainer who isn\u2019t afraid to push himself, his music, and his genre to the limits. He did this with \u201cHeroes,\u201d combining an electric beat with emotions through lyrics and melody that are not in line with what the genre presents.\n\nAlesso creates songs that fans can listen to in their car, but that transform into something larger-than-life when he performs. For all of his commercial success, Alesso has also set himself apart for his live performances.\n\nWith his music and visuals, Alesso creates experiences that have made him one of the genre\u2019s most celebrated performers. In 2012, he joined Madonna as the opener during her MDNA tour. He\u2019s also moved fans at the biggest festivals music has to offer like Coachella, EDC, Ultra, and Tomorrowland.\n\nHe and Hailee Steinfeld released \u201cLet Me Go\u201d with Florida Georgia Line and Watt; reaching no. 9 on the US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart and cracked the US Billboard Hot 100. His collaboration with Anitta, \u201cIs That For Me,\u201d cracked the Billboard\u2019s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs\u2019 top 25. This song earned a Radio Disney Music Award nomination.\n\nAlesso recently made his long-awaited return to both Brooklyn, New York and San Francisco, California. He performed a unique, visually stunning, Nick DeMoura-designed set for fans that sold out the shows in minutes.\n\nHe joined Good Morning America on August 31st for a special performance that wrapped up the iconic show\u2019s Summer Concert Series, performing his latest single \u201cREMEDY\u201d live for the first time.\n\nNo collaboration or venue is too big or too bold for Alesso who doesn\u2019t back down from any challenge with his music in order to create something truly special.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Linda Perry ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/134330.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born on April 15, 1965, in Springfield, MA, Linda Perry spent her youth struggling with kidney disease and then addiction before focusing on music. Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

Caitlyn Smith, one of Nashville's most prized writers, is one of them: and, after years spent composing songs for and with everyone from Dolly Parton to Garth Brooks to Meghan Trainor, she's finally ready to unveil all sides of her enormous talent with Starfire. Long lauded for her ability to whirl pure emotion into unforgettable tracks, Starfire is a raw, visceral journey about love, hardship and the struggle to pave your own way, all anchored by her unforgettable tone. A few minutes of listening and one thing becomes abundantly clear: there is no one better to sing the music of Caitlyn Smith than Smith herself.\n\n\"I wanted to unlock my heart and dig around inside a little,\" Smith says about the songs of Starfire, with the first five songs available now. \"And I wanted to be more vulnerable, and tell the stories I have lived. It's more of a raw process to write for myself.\"\n\nIndeed, songs like \"Before You Called Me Baby\" shake the listener to the core: blending her soulful vocals with stirring, deeply honest lyrics and instrumentation that only amplifies the organic construction, they occupy a unique space that can both blossom with a full band or be stripped down into intimate, solo experiences. Because Smith, who has toured and opened for acts such as Eric Church, Sheryl Crow and Dierks Bentley, understands not only how important the craft itself is, but also how music can \u2013 and should - transform in a live setting. With just her acoustic guitar, Smith can stun to silence.\n\nRaised in the small town of Cannon Falls, Minnesota, Smith grew up singing in the church and at county fairs \u2013 and it soon became abundantly clear that her talent stretched well beyond the ordinary. She wrote her first songs at the young age of eight, and had already convinced her parents that a career as an artist was her true path by the time she reached her teenage years. \"I released two records before I graduated high school,\" Smith recalls. \"I knew I needed to do music and nothing else.\" After a stint in Minneapolis, it was clear that Nashville was where she belonged, and she quickly became a sought-after force in the songwriting scene: so much so that even music she intended to sing herself quickly got snatched up by others, yielding her two top country hits, including the platinum \"Wasting All These Tears,\" recorded by Cassadee Pope.\n\nA celebrated force in the writer's room, Smith's also had her songs cut by Parton, Brooks and Lady Antebellum, and co-wrote Trainor's John Legend duet, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" among many others. For a while, Smith balanced her two worlds \u2013 as an artist, and a writer \u2013 while primarily focusing on the latter, working to perfect her craft and discover exactly what she wanted to say in her solo work. She released some music under her own name, but it didn't capture the spirit she ultimately wanted. \"I was shooting for something instead of singing music that was in my heart, that I loved,\" she says, as honest as ever. \"So I stepped back. I said to myself, 'the next thing that I release, I don't want to ask anybody's opinion. I want to go into the studio and make a record that I love and is true to me.'\"\n\nThat next thing became Starfire, produced by Paul Moak, who quickly became Smith's trusted collaborator. They would often bunker down at his Nashville studio, while Smith enlisted friends and colleagues for co-writes, like Gordie Sampson, Kate York and Sarah Buxton. But suddenly, some news came along: Smith was expecting a child. \"It added a beautiful layer of excitement,\" she says. \"Not only was I making a record, but I'm making a life. This little boy has been along for the ride.\"\n\nStarfire, itself, is all about growth, and what it takes to get to your most honest and true incarnation. Smith decided to trust her strengths: her soulful vocals, her strong sense of imaginative storytelling and her ability to craft melodies that exist outside of genre walls and instead focus on timelessness. But there are plenty of infectious hooks in there, too.\n\n\"We didn't want to think about genre or radio or any boundaries,\" she says. Like Chris Stapleton, Maren Morris or even Crow, she artfully blends a steady catalogue of influences and reference points, held together by stellar craft and her formidable voice. \"We wanted to make music that moved us, stay out of the way of the songs and let my voice shine through. Some songs sound more country, some sound more folk. There's a little rock and soul in there, too, which makes it a bit of a genre-less record. But it feels just right to me.\"\n\nGenreless, maybe, but full of vitality, and also downright honest. Take a song like \"This Town is Killing Me,\" about how life as an artist in Music City isn\u2019t all champagne and roses, even when there are small successes. \"It can be a such a hard, heartbreak town,\" Smith says. \"As much as you want to write those songs you know would pay the bills, if you did it every day, the artist part in you would die. There is this balance of loving this town because you get to create, but also it is just so brutal.\" Smith isn\u2019t the kind to smile and nod \u2013 instead, she turns her emotions into moments like this that manage to be about both her own experience and the human condition as a whole.\n\nAnd then there are songs like \"Tacoma,\" devastating in both its lyrics and its sheer beauty: \"I'm burning your memory one mile at a time\" Smith sings in her stunning vocal delivery to stripped-down production. Then, of course, there is the title track, which blends a pop groove with a soulful, chugging chorus. It's about how important it is to keep going even when the world wants to bring you down \u2013 an attitude that has ruled Smith's career thus far. Here, she proclaims her strength to a dynamite beat: it's one thing to have the talent to be a star, but it's another to have the will to keep your fire flaming bright.\n\n\"This whole record and process, I've been on a journey,\" she says. \u201cI've heard no many times and just kept going. I've learned that one thing is for certain: nothing is going to burn me out.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/caitlynsmith"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Smoothboi Ezra ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353914.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Post Genre, Alternative, Alt-rock, Alt-folk.", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Smoothboi Ezra tipped as Hot for 2020 by Hotpress magazine and a 2020 Plec Pick by Goldenplec online magazine.\n\nEzra, 18-year-old musician from Co Wicklow creates post genre bedroom pop / anti-pop.

It also has the media capitol of the world sitting right there in the middle. This Southern Californian duality runs deep in the Los Angeles bred band The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe band is comprised of bass, drums, guitar, piano, pedal steel and banjo. The Alpine Camp could hang with the bluegrass crowd if it wasn\u2019t for the drummer. You could also expect Gram Parsons to waltz through the door since they can chicken pick with the best.

Bell had traveled to Nashville and fallen back in love with country, bluegrass and songwriting in general. When that love turned into melodies, Etienne was there to foster those ideas into finished songs. From there, what started as a one off project, blossomed to include some of the most deft players in Southern California. The musicians who added their signature sounds to those initial recordings have since become permanent and integral members of what is now The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe Alpine Camp has spread their mountain tinged roots rock far and wide since 2014. Since then they have performed at Earth Jam, the California Oysterfest, OC Music Fest and shared the stage with Atlas Genius, The Brothers Comatose, Midnight North, The Motet and Ghost Light amongst many others.\n\nThe Alpine Camp seems to think traditional roots instrumentation and exploratory rock can coexist and so do their fans.

As their dream-pop opus drew global acclaim (and won Best Alternative Album at the 2019 Juno Awards), the Oshawa, Ontario-based band found that their finely wrought outpouring had built a powerful bond with their fans\u2014a contingent that frontwoman Katie Munshaw refers to as \u201cour little heartbreak club.\u201d Joined by the trio of brothers who make up the rest of Dizzy\u2014drummer Charlie Spencer and his siblings Alex (guitar) and Mackenzie (bass)\u2014Munshaw soon set to work on new music that explores an even more tangled landscape of feelings.\n\n\nDizzy instill their songs with a warm and open-hearted sincerity, an extension of the gentle camaraderie within the band itself. Though they formed in 2015, Dizzy\u2019s origins lie in the longtime friendship between Munshaw and Charlie, who met in ninth-grade math class and later sang together in the school choir. Upon graduating high school, the two decided to sidestep the university path and start a band, enlisting Mackenzie and Alex and getting their start gigging in local bars. After playing one of their very first shows in Toronto, Dizzy landed a deal with Royal Mountain Records, then released Baby Teeth in August 2018. Along with winning their Juno Award, the band found Baby Teeth included on the 2019 Polaris Music Prize Long List and praised by such tastemaking outlets as Stereogum, Earmilk, and The Line of Best Fit.\n\nOn the beautifully breezy new single \u201cSunflower,\u201d Munshaw drifts between self-loathing and tender self-talk, her lyrics alternately telegraphing raw sensitivity and sweetly self-deprecating humor (e.g., \u201cI wanna hear the sound/Of what a broken heart does/When I fling it to the ground\u201d). \u201cThe song is a 3 and a half minute \u201csnap out of it!\u201d to myself when I\u2019m feeling low, unconfident or not myself\u201d.", "otherInfo": "Gonna be playing a song you haven't heard yet and taking questions all about our new record over on our Instagram (@dizzytheband)."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tender Beats ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10177573.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Alternative, Punk Rock, Alternative Rock, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "NYC rock band from Colombia, Italy and Canada", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Peter Mulvey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8655140.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Americana, Spoken Word, Blues, Folk, Acoustic, Jazz", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Over the past 20 years, Mulvey has pursued a restless, eclectic path as a writer and musician \u2013 immersing himself in Tin PanAlley jazz, modern acoustic, poetry, narrative, and Americana stylings. Relentlessly touring as a headliner \u2013 his attitude is, \u201cWhen you love what you do, you can work all the time,\u201d \u2013 he has also shared the stage with luminaries such as Emmylou Harris, Richard Thompson, Ani diFranco, Indigo Girls, and Greg Brown, and has attracted an audience that stretches from Anchorage to Amsterdam.\n\nPeter Mulvey began as a self-described \u201ccity kid\u201d from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He played, wrote, and sang in bands while studying theatre there, and then traveled to Dublin, Ireland, in 1989, where he learned the trade of the street singer. Returning to the States, he relocated to Boston and began making a living as a subway and street busker, as well as releasing the first few of many CDs. Within a couple years he took to the road full time.\n\nThe road years further seasoned his abilities as a performer. Whether playing solo or with a band in tow, Mulvey has a rare ability to hold an audience\u2019s attention and transport them, using wit, humor, and a subtle but sophisticated melodic and harmonic sensibility to gracefully introduce complex and provocative concepts and characters.\n\nHighlight recordings over the years include 1995's \"Rapture\", \"The Trouble With Poets\" (produced by David Goodrich in 2000), 2004's \"Kitchen Radio\", the fan favorite \"Notes from Elsewhere\" (entirely solo versions of his songs) and recently, his collaborations with Chuck Prophet (\"Silver Ladder\"), Ani DiFranco (\"Are You Listening?\"), and Todd Sickafoose (\"There Is Another World\").\n\nCollaboration is another source for Peter\u2019s continued growth. In 2003, he released the trio album, Redbird, with fellow songwriters Kris Delmhorst and Jeffrey Foucault. The album\u2019s 17 songs range from jazz standards to old country tunes to contemporary covers, all recorded in three days around one microphone. Peter\u2019s annual hometown holiday in-the-round gigs have become an institution over nearly a decade. He can sit in with nearly any musician or ensemble and improvise in the common language of music.\n\nAs a complement to his touring and recording, Peter has also kept a hand in education; teaching guitar and songwriting workshops across the country. His songs and deep baritone voice have been heard in documentary films, major television shows, and by dance and theater companies. His longstanding gig at the National Youth Science Camp gave rise to an illustrated book, \"Vlad the Astrophysicist\".\n\nFor over ten years Peter has done an annual Fall tour entirely by bicycle, partly for environmental reasons and partly for the sheer fun of continuing his creative, unorthodox approach to a long and fruitful career as an artist.\n\nIn every aspect of his career, Mulvey draws on an extremely broad swath of influence; he is always reading, listening, and eager to hear new poetry, modern minimalist composers, old-time fiddle tunes, Argentinean trip-hop, or top-shelf bar bands. Said The Irish Times: \u201cPeter Mulvey is consistently the most original and dynamic of the US singer-songwriters to tour these shores. A phenomenal performer with huge energy, a quick fire, quirky take on life, and an extraordinary guitar style. A joy to see.\u201d\n\nStill, it is the live performance that defines that work. Night after night, whether performing solo, duo (with David \u201cGoody\u201d Goodrich), or sometimes even with a band, Mulvey attempts to be the sum of his parts, to draw on all the musical legacies he has studied, to make a fresh, vital moment out of everything he and the audience have brought to the table that night. \u201cPeople need this. I need this. To come together in a room, to try to make music come alive, for real, for right now, and then to let it go\u2026that is the whole deal for me.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.signaturesounds.com/homesessions"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tuk Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10071157.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/tuksmithofficial"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ NotSoNice ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10302029.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Jacking House", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Every week log on to DJ NotSoNice live @Basement Party Society Radio from 7-9PM!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Russ Parrish Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10356388.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Acoustic Pop, Americana, Acoustic, Folk Rock, Pop, Folk, Indie, Country, Acoustic Rock, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Russ Parrish is an award winning singer-songwriter Nashville native who moved to Minnesota in 2016.\n\nInfluenced by artists like Ed Sheeran, Andy Grammer, and NEEDTOBREATHE, his lyrics and melodies come together to form powerful songs.\n\nRuss has won several awards including the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, the Chris Austin Songwriting Contest, and the Minnesota State Fair Amateur Talent Contest.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hayes Carll ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6177605.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country, Singer, Alternative Country, Songwriter", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The chorus to the title track on the new Hayes Carll album, What It Is, is a manifesto.\n\nWhat it was is gone forever / What it could be God only knows.\n\nWhat it is is right here in front of me / and I\u2019m not letting go.\n\nHe\u2019s embracing the moment. Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ward Hayden & The Outliers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8813059.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Alt-country, Country, Rockabilly, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Their love for early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, true country, raw blues and pretty much any kind of authentic American music branded them quickly as anomalous \u2014 and electrifying.

Relentlessly touring as a headliner \u2013 his attitude is, \u201cWhen you love what you do, you can work all the time,\u201d \u2013 he has also shared the stage with luminaries such as Emmylou Harris, Richard Thompson, Ani diFranco, Indigo Girls, and Greg Brown, and has attracted an audience that stretches from Anchorage to Amsterdam.\n\nPeter Mulvey began as a self-described \u201ccity kid\u201d from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He played, wrote, and sang in bands while studying theatre there, and then traveled to Dublin, Ireland, in 1989, where he learned the trade of the street singer. Returning to the States, he relocated to Boston and began making a living as a subway and street busker, as well as releasing the first few of many CDs. Within a couple years he took to the road full time.\n\nThe road years further seasoned his abilities as a performer. Whether playing solo or with a band in tow, Mulvey has a rare ability to hold an audience\u2019s attention and transport them, using wit, humor, and a subtle but sophisticated melodic and harmonic sensibility to gracefully introduce complex and provocative concepts and characters.\n\nHighlight recordings over the years include 1995's \"Rapture\", \"The Trouble With Poets\" (produced by David Goodrich in 2000), 2004's \"Kitchen Radio\", the fan favorite \"Notes from Elsewhere\" (entirely solo versions of his songs) and recently, his collaborations with Chuck Prophet (\"Silver Ladder\"), Ani DiFranco (\"Are You Listening?\"), and Todd Sickafoose (\"There Is Another World\").\n\nCollaboration is another source for Peter\u2019s continued growth. In 2003, he released the trio album, Redbird, with fellow songwriters Kris Delmhorst and Jeffrey Foucault. The album\u2019s 17 songs range from jazz standards to old country tunes to contemporary covers, all recorded in three days around one microphone. Peter\u2019s annual hometown holiday in-the-round gigs have become an institution over nearly a decade. He can sit in with nearly any musician or ensemble and improvise in the common language of music.\n\nAs a complement to his touring and recording, Peter has also kept a hand in education; teaching guitar and songwriting workshops across the country. His songs and deep baritone voice have been heard in documentary films, major television shows, and by dance and theater companies. His longstanding gig at the National Youth Science Camp gave rise to an illustrated book, \"Vlad the Astrophysicist\".\n\nFor over ten years Peter has done an annual Fall tour entirely by bicycle, partly for environmental reasons and partly for the sheer fun of continuing his creative, unorthodox approach to a long and fruitful career as an artist.\n\nIn every aspect of his career, Mulvey draws on an extremely broad swath of influence; he is always reading, listening, and eager to hear new poetry, modern minimalist composers, old-time fiddle tunes, Argentinean trip-hop, or top-shelf bar bands. Said The Irish Times: \u201cPeter Mulvey is consistently the most original and dynamic of the US singer-songwriters to tour these shores. A phenomenal performer with huge energy, a quick fire, quirky take on life, and an extraordinary guitar style. A joy to see.\u201d\n\nStill, it is the live performance that defines that work. Night after night, whether performing solo, duo (with David \u201cGoody\u201d Goodrich), or sometimes even with a band, Mulvey attempts to be the sum of his parts, to draw on all the musical legacies he has studied, to make a fresh, vital moment out of everything he and the audience have brought to the table that night. \u201cPeople need this. I need this. To come together in a room, to try to make music come alive, for real, for right now, and then to let it go\u2026that is the whole deal for me.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.signaturesounds.com/homesessions"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hailey James Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10167475.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country, Singer Songwriter", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "16 year-old recording artist, Hailey James is a singer/songwriter/performer from Cottage Grove, MN.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hayes Carll ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6177605.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country, Singer, Alternative Country, Songwriter", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The chorus to the title track on the new Hayes Carll album, What It Is, is a manifesto.\n\nWhat it was is gone forever / What it could be God only knows.\n\nWhat it is is right here in front of me / and I\u2019m not letting go.\n\nHe\u2019s embracing the moment. Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped.

The four original members, Scott Blasey (vocals, acoustic guitar), Rob James (6 and 12-string electric guitars, vocals), Greg Joseph (bass, vocals) and David Minarik (drums, vocals) are joined by fellow touring mates Gary Jacob, Skip Sanders and Noah Minarik, tossing out some spanking pedal steel, Hammond organ and tasty guitar. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had more fun composing and recording songs,\u201d says bass player Greg Joseph. \u201cWith our storied recording history, it\u2019s really heartening to know that music can still captivate the band as much as it has on this album.\u201d\n\nWith a highlight reel that includes the Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and others, The Clarks are enjoying their stage time together now more than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s one big extended family,\u201d says guitarist Rob James. \u201cDave\u2019s son Noah plays on this album, and with us live, so saying that isn\u2019t just a metaphor, it\u2019s fact!\u201d Singing and playing the songs of Madly In Love At The End Of The World has rekindled a fire in The Clarks\u2019 sometimes broken, sometimes mended hearts.\n\nThe Clarks are:\nScott Blasey: Lead Vocals, Electric & Acoustic Guitars\nRobert James: Electric & Acoustic Guitars, Vocals\nGreg Joseph: Bass Guitar, Vocals\nDave Minarik: Drums, Vocals", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bully ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8995670.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Losing out October 20th on Sub Pop http://smarturl.it/BullyLosing", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fantasia ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10366083.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "R&b, R&b & Soul, Rock Soul", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "North Carolina native Fantasia broke on to the scene in 2004 as the season three winner of Fox\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Later that year, she released her platinum-selling debut album Free Yourself and became the first artist in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart to debut at #1 with her first single, \u201cI Believe.\" Fantasia\u2019s 2006 eponymous second album featured the #1 R&B single, \u201cWhen I See U,\u201d and reached gold status.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends.

George Jones' own widow, Nancy, personally hired James for his first steady gig at the George Jones Museum in Nashville, allowing him to make a living playing music and to hone his hobby-turned-profession in an accelerated fashion. Since then, James has played several shows each week in downtown Nashville at places like The George Jones and AJ's Good Time Bar when he's not on the road, having played over 1500 public, corporate, and private events since January 2015.\n\nIn addition to supporting his young family and connecting with other musicians and songwriters, performing downtown has helped James build a large fan base of folks drawn through the doors by the booming voice echoing down Broadway and 2nd Avenue. Playing so many shows in a relatively short time-frame in a city with an excess of raw talent forced him to sharpen his stage show quickly and continue to refine the thing he's always enjoyed most \u2014 entertaining and interacting with his audiences in a way that leaves most people feeling like they've made a new friend.\n\nJames was the 2018 WSM Road Show Winner, resulting in the opportunity to make his Grand Ole Opry debut opening for Alan Jackson at the Ryman Auditorium on January 17, 2020. He was also selected by Jackson from the crop of rising artists who play at AJ\u2019s Good Time Bar, Jackson\u2019s self-owned honky-tonk on downtown Nashville\u2019s famed \u201cLower Broadway,\u201d to open select dates on Jackson\u2019s 2019 \u201cHonky Tonk Highway\u201d tour. Over the past few years, James has enjoyed playing several opening slots, festivals, fairs, and private events in locations all across the United States and has even had the opportunity to travel to Canada, Japan, Scotland, and Norway for shows.", "otherInfo": "James Carothers & Jerry Lee Combs\nFacebook Live Stream\nVenue 720, Flora, IL.\n\nTuesday, May 12\n8 - 10 PM\n\nInfo from Venue 720:\nWabash Communications CO-OP and Clay County State Bank in Louisville have joined up with us and we are excited about what\u2019s in store!!

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service.

Inspired by \u201890s trip-hop, footwork, and downtempo R&B, Rituals of Mine has crafted a uniquely heavy sound that fuels its cathartic and uplifting performances. For the past decade that Lopez has been actively crafting music, multimedia art, and poetry, she has always seen her creative output as a necessary therapy. \u201cFor a long time I didn\u2019t go to therapy, and I used music as a release.\u201d explains Lopez. \u201cI\u2019m able to convey on stage what I can\u2019t off stage, and these songs that we\u2019ve written and performed\u2014I\u2019ve clung to them as a means of survival almost.\u201d What began as a notebook of poems Lopez kept during her youth in South Sacramento, has evolved into a lush and genre-defying body of work.\n\nAfter two close deaths and a period of reflection in 2016, Lopez felt she needed to reassess her life and her musical project, Sister Crayon. The project was reinvented through Rituals of Mine, and with the new moniker Lopez began writing the most honest and personal songs she had ever written. After years of obscuring her story and emotions through metaphorical lyrics, Lopez felt a sudden confidence to write more directly about her experiences as a queer woman of color. Lopez began fleshing out the songs with her long time collaborator and producer Wes Jones, who helped turn Lopez\u2019s heartfelt writing about trauma and personal growth into urgent and powerful electronic tracks. Lopez then enlisted Adam Pierce to play drums, knowing that their background in metal percussion would provide an intensity that could match her own.\n\nSince releasing their debut, Devoted, in 2016, Rituals of Mine has been praised within the indie music community, and Lopez\u2019s interactive art exhibit that simulates female-identifying people's experiences with street harassment, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, has reached over 200,000 participants. Rituals of Mine has shared its music and message around the world, touring with acts like Garbage, Tricky, Built to Spill, DEFTONES, and Le Butcherettes. The band is excited to release their new EP, SLEEPER HOLD, this fall through Carpark Records. With these new songs and their upcoming live shows, Lopez hopes to continue to inspire audiences in her local community and around the country to overcome their own struggles and indulge their cathartic outpour.", "otherInfo": "No Place Like Home: a livestream benefit series for the Bay Area Music Community!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nick Jonas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8497380.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Multi-platinum and Grammy nominated recording artist, actor, and award winning songwriter, Nick Jonas released his self-titled debut album in November 2014.

Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed.

Her style fuses influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton Island with Americana grooves and musical innovations, creating a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Hanneke\u2019s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as \u201cexuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.\u201d\n\nA prolific composer, Hanneke writes music from personal experiences of love and loss as well as to commemorate the joys and sorrows in the lives of loved ones. Hanneke\u2019s latest release, Trip to Walden Pond, features traditional Scottish and Cape Breton tunes and seventeen new pieces composed in the Scottish idiom. While her lively style is very much evident, this new album carries a deep, soulful sound with songs of celebration and farewell. Produced by Finnish musician Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 (FRIGG, JPP, Baltic Crossing), the album showcases long-time musical collaborators cellist Mike Block, guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis, fiddler/violist Jeremy Kittel, and pianist Dave Wiesler. Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 contributes guitar and piano to a couple of tracks and piper Samppa Saarinen is featured on the uilleann pipes. Trip to Walden Pond, similar to Hanneke\u2019s five previous albums, offers mellifluous arrangements of traditional fiddle music and original tunes that evoke humor and heart. This latest album also includes several compositions penned by Hanneke as commissions to benefit Many Hopes, a children\u2019s education nonprofit based in Kenya that she avidly supports.\n\nA native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community -- both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser\u2019s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp (run by her husband, acclaimed cellist Mike Block), Harald Haugaard\u2019s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor\u2019s of Music in Violin Performance.\n\nHanneke is a sought-after performer who has graced stages across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. She has been featured at Celtic Connections (Glasgow, Scotland), KVMR Celtic Fest (Grass Valley, USA), Milwaukee Irish Fest (Milwaukee, USA), Celtic Colours (Cape Breton, Canada), WGBH Christmas Celtic Sojourn (Boston, USA) and the National Celtic Festival (Port Arlington, Australia). The Hanneke Cassel Band features Mike Block on cello and alternating guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis.\n\nIn addition to performing with her own band, Hanneke has been featured on PBS with Boston-based fiddle band Childsplay and has performed with Baroque/Celtic group Ensemble Galilei at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (with former NPR \u2018Talk of the Nation\u2019 host Neal Conan) and the National Geographic in Washington, D.C. (with actor Bill Pullman). She has made guest appearances with Cherish the Ladies, Matt Glaser & the Wayfaring Strangers, Alasdair Fraser & Natalie Haas, and Joey McIntyre (from New Kids on the Block.)", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/silkroadproject"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Darzack ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371169.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pacific K ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8989598.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Toms Kursitis, Kristaps Bedritis, Rihards Libietis, Nauris Babris", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Worldly sounds set in a meditative indie/rock mood that carry deep and melancholic stories with a dark twist and a light at the end of the tunnel.

Songs of love, alchemy and life\u2019s journeys. Beautiful vocals, bittersweet melodies and a cheeky pop edge.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, music is often reduced to background noise and treated like a mass-produced product to be sold, even by those who create it. Few in the business give much thought to artistry or how their music impacts those who listen. UK folk-pop duo Faeland is an emerging act that is fully committed to making music that changes lives for the better and adds something good to human existence. Gentle, intuitive, and mystical, the music on Faeland\u2019s debut album All My Swim blends folk traditions from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Singer-songwriter stylings and a dose of pop bring a captivating sound with instant appeal.\n\nFaeland is the brainchild of singer-songwriters Rebecca Nelson and Jacob Morrison, a project designed to break them both out of their comfort zones and to allow them to do meaningful work, not merely start another band. This lead to All My Swim, a song cycle that deals with the deeper themes of humanity like love, healing, and magic. Nelson and Morrison come from families of artists, creatives and healers and this gives a natural quality to these ideas that would flounder in lesser hands. The sound is acoustic guitars and double bass mixed with drums, harp, santour, and violin. Ethereal, bittersweet vocals float across the mix and complete the picture. Echoes of Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac and Gillian Welch are detectable but the vibe is original and individual.\n\nFaeland\u2019s sound and mission pair up well together and create a beautiful vulnerability that is authentic and true. Songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Just A Love Song\u201d, \u201cAll My Swim\u201d and \u201cThe Wheel\u201d offer listeners a seductive realness that rises above all the pushed product out there and must be heard and experienced to be fully understood. Faeland\u2019s focus on positive impact and ample musical skills have the potential to touch the world. Fans of well-executed modern folk will want to find this band soon, while it can still be seen up close.", "otherInfo": "Join us live for episode 3 of this weekly livestream!\n\nIn today's episode we perform acoustic renditions of songs from our debut album All My Swim, share previously unheard material and more - anything could happen!

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs.

Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working.

Still a teen when breakout single \u2018Sweet About Me\u2019 conquered the globe, the Australian artist was thrust into the glare of the spotlight, enjoying chart success after chart success.\n\nYet the more she travelled, the further away from her roots she became. \u201cIt was a bit of an odd time for me, because it was a big departure from why I got into music in the first place. All of a sudden I\u2019m onstage dancing in a sexy robot costume,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt left me in a place where I felt like I had really lost my way from why I wanted to do this in the first place.\u201d\n\nSo she went back to the source. Living in London for the past decade, her 2013 album \u2018The Sting\u2019 was a \u201cshedding of the skin moment\u201d, with Gabriella grappling with independence for the first time. \u201cIt felt like I didn\u2019t know who I was, so I was figuring that out,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was all about stripping things back and going back to the complete basics of writing a song; to go back to the roots of why I loved music in the first place.\u201d\n\nA pivotal moment was watching The Band\u2019s iconic performance in The Last Waltz. Friends onstage making music together, their fusion of country, soul, blues, and Americana lit up Gabriella\u2019s imagination. Working with her brother Joseph as co-songwriter and Eliot James as producer, the three stripped her music to the core, and her new EP is the bravest, most explicitly honest thing Gabriella Cilmi has ever done.\n\nLead single \u2018Ruins\u2019 is a beautiful piece of gilded country-soul, her husky voice set against that graceful acoustic guitar. If it feels incredibly natural then that\u2019s because it is \u2013 this is her voice, her vision, and her life. \u201cI make it because I love it,\u201d she comments. It\u2019s just something that I think I have to do.\u201d\n\nRecorded in short bursts of creativity, Gabriella wanted to use as much analogue equipment as possible, resulting in an organic, inviting sound. She explains: \u201cIt has to feel loose, and it has to feel as though you\u2019re in the room as much as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2018Forgiveness\u2019 is a meditation on the bond between family, while \u2018Safe From Harm\u2019 - \u201cI\u2019m a sucker for a sad waltz!\u201d - is incredibly personal, dealing with guilt, absolution, and mental health. \u201cI went to a Catholic girl\u2019s school and we always started the day with a hymn,\u201d she recalls. \u201cMy brother always jokes, that I\u2019ve got this massive cross to bear! I\u2019m a really loyal person but I also have this thing where I do have this guilt and that\u2019s what I deal with in my songs, and in my music.\u201d\n\nWorking quickly, Gabriella managed to get her feelings down on tape. Musically, it\u2019s honeyed, Autumnal tones are crisp, refreshing, recalling everyone from greats such as Van Morrison and Janis Joplin through to contemporaries such as The Staves or First Aid Kit. But lyrically the EP is a process of exoneration, of letting go.\n\n\u201cA lot of the time you won\u2019t know what a song means until you write it down,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best things tend to come really quickly. If I spend too much time on something, if it\u2019s too laborious, then it\u2019s normally because it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nThe process of making the EP has been both cathartic and transformative, with the scorching autobiography of the songwriting aiding her own life. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who takes things to heart, and holds on to things. Keeps it in locked inside. But everything about this record \u2013 instead of internalising everything it\u2019s just letting it breathe. It\u2019s all about capturing the moment.\u201d\n\nGabriella Cilmi has found her path, and she intends to see where it leads.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Burgess ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8263503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Burgess (born Timothy Allan Burgess on May 30, 1967, in Salford, Lancashire, England) is the lead singer of British rock/indie act The Charlatans.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

She is the daughter of two classical musicians - her father a conductor and composer, her mother an opera singer, musicologist, teacher and bellydancer. No matter which household she was living in, she was \u201calways music-making and creating.\u201d\n\nFresh out of school, she was singing jazz in NYC\u2019s West Village for tips, singing in cover bands and writing songs before signing with Atlantic Records (2003) \u2014a time period that saw her score a Top 40 hit with \u201cDumb Girls\u201d and another Top 5 hit she wrote for Stacie Orrico called \u201c(There's Gotta Be) More to Life\u201d, earning her 2 BMI Awards. With her debut record in tow, she toured the US, Japan and New Zealand and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nBut Woodward had no desire to be a pop starlet: her follow-up, the jazzier, punchier indie record Lucy Woodward is...Hot and Bothered was released in 2008 which \u201cshed new light\u201d on music-making again. Hot and Bothered was inspired by her days at Manhattan School of Music, lots of Etta James and the 1967 classic animated film The Jungle Book bringing her back to her bluesy roots. Billboard described how \u201cLucy's a ball, equally appreciable for fans of melodic sing-along baubles and highbrow aficionados of finely honed musical composition. A sonic turnstile that flips through dreamy pop, jazz and bluesy bebop\u201d.\n\nThis, in turn, was followed by Hooked!, an album of Brill Building meets Big Band songs, released on Verve/Universal (2010) -- which was largely produced by Tony Visconti (David Bowie). The album effortlessly moves across multiple genres, including gypsy-swing, jazz and rhythm & blues. Along with her self-penned compositions, the album showcases Lucy\u2019s stunning covers of Peggy Lee\u2019s Cuban-inspired \u201cSans Souci\u201d and an a cappella Hoagy Carmichael classic, \u201cStardust.\u201d Nellie McKay, who Lucy had always been a hardcore fan of, wrote a song for her called \u201cAnother Woman\u201d which Lucy recorded on Hooked! as well (featuring Nellie on background vocals).\n\nIn 2012, Lucy was asked to tour as a band member filling in for the lead singer of Pink Martini learning songs in Turkish, French Croatian, Japanese and Spanish with 6 days notice. Lucy\u2019s dates with Pink Martini varied from Montreal Jazz Fest to singing with the San Francisco Symphony for several performances. That same year, Lucy has also toured overseas sponsored by Armed Forces Entertainment, performing for American military units stationed in Spain, Italy and Turkey.\n\nLucy began to work with Snarky Puppy bandleader Michael League, who played bass in her NYC band at the time. She started opening for Snarky Puppy (with them as her backing band) and was featured on Snarky Puppy\u2019s Family Dinner, Vol. 1 album singing the hauntingly bluesy \u201cToo Hot To Last\u201d. The album earned them their first Grammy. League and longtime friend keyboardist/arranger Henry Hey (Forq, Rudder, David Bowie) co-produced her fourth solo album Til They Bang on The Door, which was released on GroundUP/Verve/Universal in 2016. The album features the Snarky Puppy horns, Cory Henry on organ and Grammy nominees trombonist Alan Ferber and cellist Dave Eggar as well as many other musicians in their NYC community. She continues to tour with Snarky Puppy and Forq.\n\nIn 2017, Lucy debuted her material with Big Band arrangements from two of her albums performing at Aarhus Jazz Festival and Jam Days with TipToe Big Band in Denmark. She has continued to perform her Big band material in Holland, Miami and Los Angeles. In 2018, Lucy was invited to perform in collaboration with Germany's WDR Big Band with arrangements/conducted by Chris Walden. Together, Lucy and Walden created \u201cLove and Other Bad Habits\u201d, a repertoire of Big Band songs on vices, addictions and other odd human behaviors. Lucy was the featured guest in a 2-week residency with bandleader/trumpeter Dominick Farinacci at Jazz At Lincoln Center in Shanghai, China in December, 2018.\n\nFor much of 2018, Lucy toured with Charlie Hunter. They will be releasing their first debut collaboration Music!Music!Music! in Spring of 2019. The record consists of groove-heavy renditions of blues and classic vintage pop. They will be touring the US and Europe throughout 2019.\n\nIn addition to her solo career, Woodward toured with Rod Stewart for many years singing background vocals. She has also sung on albums by Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Chaka Khan, Snarky Puppy, Barbra Streisand, Nikka Costa, Carole King, Joe Cocker, Michael Bolton, Gavin DeGraw and Randy Jackson. Her songs and vocals have been heard in many movies/TV shows including What a Girl Wants, The Blind Side, Music and Lyrics, New Year\u2019s Eve, First Daughter, Last Vegas, Footloose, Manhattan Nocturne, Accepted and Disney\u2019s Ice Princess, with her rendition of Bjork/Betty Hutton big band cover \"It's Oh So Quiet.\"\n\nwww.lucywoodward.com", "otherInfo": "Next class: The Singer Life!\nw/ guest Stevvi Alexander\n(session & studio singer, vocal contractor, background singer, artist)\n\nSliding scale $1 - $50\nAll levels welcome!\n\n- building vocal strength and range\n- getting work, working as a singer or background singer\n- vocal health\n- studio vocals vs. the road\n- developing your sound\n- vocally blending with others\nvocally\n\nStevvi Alexander has sung with eeeeveryone.

She is the daughter of two classical musicians - her father a conductor and composer, her mother an opera singer, musicologist, teacher and bellydancer. No matter which household she was living in, she was \u201calways music-making and creating.\u201d\n\nFresh out of school, she was singing jazz in NYC\u2019s West Village for tips, singing in cover bands and writing songs before signing with Atlantic Records (2003) \u2014a time period that saw her score a Top 40 hit with \u201cDumb Girls\u201d and another Top 5 hit she wrote for Stacie Orrico called \u201c(There's Gotta Be) More to Life\u201d, earning her 2 BMI Awards. With her debut record in tow, she toured the US, Japan and New Zealand and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nBut Woodward had no desire to be a pop starlet: her follow-up, the jazzier, punchier indie record Lucy Woodward is...Hot and Bothered was released in 2008 which \u201cshed new light\u201d on music-making again. Hot and Bothered was inspired by her days at Manhattan School of Music, lots of Etta James and the 1967 classic animated film The Jungle Book bringing her back to her bluesy roots. Billboard described how \u201cLucy's a ball, equally appreciable for fans of melodic sing-along baubles and highbrow aficionados of finely honed musical composition. A sonic turnstile that flips through dreamy pop, jazz and bluesy bebop\u201d.\n\nThis, in turn, was followed by Hooked!, an album of Brill Building meets Big Band songs, released on Verve/Universal (2010) -- which was largely produced by Tony Visconti (David Bowie). The album effortlessly moves across multiple genres, including gypsy-swing, jazz and rhythm & blues. Along with her self-penned compositions, the album showcases Lucy\u2019s stunning covers of Peggy Lee\u2019s Cuban-inspired \u201cSans Souci\u201d and an a cappella Hoagy Carmichael classic, \u201cStardust.\u201d Nellie McKay, who Lucy had always been a hardcore fan of, wrote a song for her called \u201cAnother Woman\u201d which Lucy recorded on Hooked! as well (featuring Nellie on background vocals).\n\nIn 2012, Lucy was asked to tour as a band member filling in for the lead singer of Pink Martini learning songs in Turkish, French Croatian, Japanese and Spanish with 6 days notice. Lucy\u2019s dates with Pink Martini varied from Montreal Jazz Fest to singing with the San Francisco Symphony for several performances. That same year, Lucy has also toured overseas sponsored by Armed Forces Entertainment, performing for American military units stationed in Spain, Italy and Turkey.\n\nLucy began to work with Snarky Puppy bandleader Michael League, who played bass in her NYC band at the time. She started opening for Snarky Puppy (with them as her backing band) and was featured on Snarky Puppy\u2019s Family Dinner, Vol. 1 album singing the hauntingly bluesy \u201cToo Hot To Last\u201d. The album earned them their first Grammy. League and longtime friend keyboardist/arranger Henry Hey (Forq, Rudder, David Bowie) co-produced her fourth solo album Til They Bang on The Door, which was released on GroundUP/Verve/Universal in 2016. The album features the Snarky Puppy horns, Cory Henry on organ and Grammy nominees trombonist Alan Ferber and cellist Dave Eggar as well as many other musicians in their NYC community. She continues to tour with Snarky Puppy and Forq.\n\nIn 2017, Lucy debuted her material with Big Band arrangements from two of her albums performing at Aarhus Jazz Festival and Jam Days with TipToe Big Band in Denmark. She has continued to perform her Big band material in Holland, Miami and Los Angeles. In 2018, Lucy was invited to perform in collaboration with Germany's WDR Big Band with arrangements/conducted by Chris Walden. Together, Lucy and Walden created \u201cLove and Other Bad Habits\u201d, a repertoire of Big Band songs on vices, addictions and other odd human behaviors. Lucy was the featured guest in a 2-week residency with bandleader/trumpeter Dominick Farinacci at Jazz At Lincoln Center in Shanghai, China in December, 2018.\n\nFor much of 2018, Lucy toured with Charlie Hunter. They will be releasing their first debut collaboration Music!Music!Music! in Spring of 2019. The record consists of groove-heavy renditions of blues and classic vintage pop. They will be touring the US and Europe throughout 2019.\n\nIn addition to her solo career, Woodward toured with Rod Stewart for many years singing background vocals. She has also sung on albums by Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Chaka Khan, Snarky Puppy, Barbra Streisand, Nikka Costa, Carole King, Joe Cocker, Michael Bolton, Gavin DeGraw and Randy Jackson. Her songs and vocals have been heard in many movies/TV shows including What a Girl Wants, The Blind Side, Music and Lyrics, New Year\u2019s Eve, First Daughter, Last Vegas, Footloose, Manhattan Nocturne, Accepted and Disney\u2019s Ice Princess, with her rendition of Bjork/Betty Hutton big band cover \"It's Oh So Quiet.\"\n\nwww.lucywoodward.com", "otherInfo": "Next class: The Singer Life!\nw/ guest Stevvi Alexander\n(session & studio singer, vocal contractor, background singer, artist)\n\nSliding scale $1 - $50\nAll levels welcome!\n\n- building vocal strength and range\n- getting work, working as a singer or background singer\n- vocal health\n- studio vocals vs. the road\n- developing your sound\n- vocally blending with others\nvocally\n\nStevvi Alexander has sung with eeeeveryone.

What began in 2011 as two artists sharing a love of Appalachian music has evolved into a visionary project that utilizes multimedia such as visual art, movement, and experimental film. Through their immersive creative process and bold interpretations, Anna & Elizabeth pioneer new ways of understanding old songs and stories.\n\nIn winter 2018, Anna & Elizabeth will release a new full-length album produced by Benjamin Lazar Davis of avant-pop outfit Cuddle Magic, featuring Jim White of The Dirty Three on drums. This new project expands on their recent studio release, the 7-inch vinyl single Hop High/Here in the Vineyard--also produced by Lazar Davis and his collaborator Alec Spiegelman--which signaled a new sonic direction with its sparse banjo and fiddle lines, pulsating pump organ, electronics, and swooping woodwind and string arrangements.\n\nArchival research and visits with elders are the bedrock of the duo\u2019s creative process. In preparation for this new record, Anna & Elizabeth spent months under the flickering fluorescent lights at the Library of Congress and at archives in the places they grew up--Vermont and Virginia, respectively--unearthing forgotten sounds recorded by song collectors some 80 years ago. During a residency at the prestigious MacDowell Colony, they continued experimenting and making art with the songs they found, discovering the many vibrating worlds within them. The pair\u2019s interest in experimental music and avant-rock is paramount in this new cycle of work. They continue to delve deeper into the works of pioneers such as Meredith Monk, Nick Cave, and Laurie Anderson, as well as drone musicians and avant composers who use field recordings in order to further unpack these old songs.\n\nSince forming six years ago, Anna & Elizabeth have released two acclaimed full-length albums\u2014Sun to Sun (2012) and Anna & Elizabeth (2015). They have performed at hundreds of venues worldwide, including National Sawdust (Brooklyn), Newport Folk Festival, NPR Music\u2019s Tiny Desk Concerts, Cambridge Folk Festival (UK) and Pickathon.

After hearing classic hip-hop albums from the era such as The College Dropout, Get Rich Or Die Tryin\u2019 and The Documentary, LTtheMonk knew that he had to find out properly what this music was. Combining this with an interest in reggae (shown to him at an early age by his Jamaican mother) and rock (via his Irish father), LT\u2019s adventurous love of music and performing onstage grew throughout the years, culminating in the release of his first EP at age 17. He has since grown into a vibrant and compelling talent. LTtheMonk\u2019s 2015 debut album, Monk in London, described his career, relationship with his home city and journey to adulthood. His 2017 release The Dark Side of the Monk was an introspective and wide-ranging session rooted in California production aesthetics and informed by contemporary race politics.\nHaving moved from the UK megacity to Hamilton, Ontario in 2017, listeners might expect LT\u2019s latest outing Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop to reflect another leap in personal and artistic evolution. And they would not be disappointed. The album is as questioning as its predecessors, serving up an in-depth exploration of his romantic relationships, place in hip-hop and the music industry, and more discoveries of his persona. The album\u2019s title nods to Diamond D\u2019s 1992 classic Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop, but the album is of-the-moment and crisply defined by local players \u2014 the sounds of Hamilton producer Judah Jump, plus Hamilton hip-hop and R&B artists Hoss Bowman and Viktoria Csik \u2014 as well as collaborations with New York\u2019s YoHanMadeTheBeat, Canadian musicians such as Aisha Barrow, Lucas Hibbs and Owen Gow, and (in a call-back to his roots) longtime friend, rapper and producer ROYOS from South London. London-made and East-Coast trained, paying homage to his home city as well as the New York MCs who were his inspiration to begin rapping after his first discovery of hip-hop.\n\nWith a new release on the horizon for 2020, you can catch LTtheMonk (emcee-vocalist LT, backed by keyboardist Santiago Rozo-Paz, bassist Cam Watson and drummer Lucas Hibbs) live on stages across Ontario.\n\nLTtheMonk\u2019s album Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop is available now on all streaming platforms.

Working with longtime collaborators Cary Marsh and Gary Watts, Fab returned to Big Sky Recording in Ann Arbor, where he and engineer Geoff Michael had made his last release nearly 20 years before. The resulting album, 2017's understated Leave My Friends, was Fab's first ever full-length release. ~ Timothy Monger", "otherInfo": "Celebrating the season finale On The Tracks Live Stream Songwriters Showcase, An evening of songwriters in the round at historic Chelsea Train Depot featuring Julianne Ankley, Scott Fab, Audra Kubat and David Rossiter."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cinema Hearts ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10375388.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Rock And Roll, Indie Rock, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "An ex-pageant queen plays rock 'n' roll; Haunting harmonies soar over the strumming of electric guitars in Cinema Hearts' tribute to the Wall of Sound.\n\n\"...sugar sweet teen pop that cozies up tight with the mellow side of Burger Records' pop-nostalgia-via-DIY catalogue.\" - Washington City Paper\n\n\"Incorporating contemporary elements of lo-fi indie and dream pop, this innovative trio brings a sound that evokes flashes of the Greatest Generation's dance halls and of DIY basement stages.\" - The Deli Magazine\n\n\"has the potential to become America\u2019s sweethearts.\" - Brightest Young Things", "otherInfo": "Tune in for a livestream takeover on the Mason Center for the Arts Facebook page with Cinema Hearts.

It wasn't until friends told Adam that his voice didn't sound half-bad that he put any thought into singing.\n\n\n\nThroughout the years since, Adam's been involved in several projects - most notably his original band Black Magnolia.

He chose Adam Levine as his coach and made it to the Top 20 on Season 13 (as the \"comeback kid\" from Season 12). Shortly afterwards, Adam Levine invited him to sing for the Maroon 5 Annual Halloween party in 2017. That night they covered only AC/DC songs with Adam Pearce singing, Adam Levine on drums, James Valentine and Andrew Watt on guitar, and Milo Decruz on bass. The night became extra memorable when Sammy Hagar jumped on stage to join Adam Pearce singing \"Highway to Hell.\" The night before, they also surprised guests and performed for the Casamigos Annual Halloween Party.\n\n\n\nIn Decemeber 2017, thanks to the support of his amazing Backers, Adam launched a very successful Kickstarter Campaign which allowed him to bring his newest songs to life with a new album.

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe. Their show is a carnival of two that will take you from the Moulin Rouge to CBGBs and back again.

To help capture and shape her own unique sound, Miss Tess enlisted not only her trusty 1930s Weymann archtop, but also heavy input from co-producers Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes, Hurray for the Riff Raff) and Thomas Bryan Eaton, her full-time bandmate and musical partner.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature.

With his fingerstyle technique, his compositions defy categorization and blend various forms and styles, including folk, rock, jazz, blues, country, world and roots. Incorporating a textured sound all his own and sense of economy in phrasing, Ray is a soulful player who lets his instrument sing, wringing emotion from every note. In the end, it's all about conveying an emotion and taking the listener away.\n\nRay Montford\u2019s new and long-awaited seventh studio album, Share My Sky, is the acclaimed guitarist\u2019s first recording in six years. Exploring the themes of loss, grief, trauma, compassion, forgiveness and love, Montford has expanded his sonic range and compositional depth to offer his most personal and emotional statement to date. Collaborating with singer/songwriter Lynn Moffatt, he co-wrote Deliver Me, a song that embodies the universal feelings of loneliness and belonging, while specifically shining light on the fate of refugees who strive to land in a safe place - a topical theme in these troubled times. The strong presence of singers Sheena Turcotte and Anouk Michelle-Gr\u00e9goire on this recording (a first in Ray\u2019s career) lends tremendous poignancy to songs Alive and Let Your River Flow, while the album\u2019s profoundly reflective title track, composed upon his return from Bali, rates as one of the most evocative melodies the guitarist has ever written.\n\nBorn in Ottawa, Ray began learning by ear and woodshedding with the great rock records of that era. After studying audio engineering, production, and performance in the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College and doing a term in the music program at Humber, he began writing and recording his own music, and by 1995 was dedicating most of his priorities in that discipline. Between 1994-'97, he was the guitar player for the Rankins and from 1997-'99, Mary Jane Lamond. His compositions have been heard on National CBC radio and have been licensed for various television series. For more than 20 years Ray and his rhythm section featuring some of Canada's best players, have played for audiences and loyal fans at music festivals, clubs, theatres, house concerts and private parties. They toured parts of Europe in 2001, shared the stage with the Tony Levin Band (alumnae of Peter Gabriel) in 2003 and sold out the Young Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto for the release of A Fragile Balance in 2007. Recently, they played the Oakville Centre for the Performing Arts to a sold-out audience, the Oakville Jazz Festival (2010 & 2012), Markham Jazz Festival (2012), and the Canadian Guitar Festival (2009, 2011 & 2014).\n\nRay has gratefully received support from the Ontario Arts Council, Toronto Arts Council, Factor and External Affairs as well as sponsorship from Totem Acoustic and Paradigm for his compostions, recording and performances. He has been a juror for the Toronto Arts Council's Composer Program and twice for the Gemini awards.

There, she found herself gravitating toward the sounds, stories, and swagger of country music, a genre that had been so prevalent back home. Formed in 2014, Honey County brought all three women together, kicking off a whirlwind career that has since found the group receiving praise from Rolling Stone; playing gigs alongside Lady Antebellum and Old Dominion; enjoying high-profile slots at CMA Fest and Stagecoach Festival; and receiving heavy airplay for independent singles like \"Love Someone\" (one of the most-played songs during the launch of Radio Disney Country),\" \"High on the Radio\", \"Los Angeles\", and \u201cCigarette\u201d.\n\nYou won't find Honey County on any map. Instead, the group takes its name from a fictional place, a move that allows the bandmates to create their own landscape of story-driven country, melodic pop, and punchy, guitar-fueled rock.

In the two decades that have followed, Sue Foley has been busy touring and recording steadily, all while toting her signature pink paisley Fender Telecaster. In 2001, she won the prestigious Juno Award (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy) and also holds the record for the most Maple Blues Awards and has earned three Trophees de Blues de France.

And I grew up sitting at the feet of players like George \u2018Big Beat\u2019 Rains, Derek O'Brien and The Texas Horns. I spent many nights watching Charlie Sexton and the Arc Angels with Chris Layton. I learned and grew more musically in my years in Austin than at any point in my life.

I am still pinching myself.\u201d\n\nA flood of inspiration and themes can be found on each of the tracks \u2013 ranging from lost love, anguish, and struggle to release, forgiveness and rebirth. Mostly recorded live-off-the-floor, Foley\u2019s emotional vocal delivery, conviction, accessible yet inspired lyrics and intrepid guitar playing are all laid out, bare and raw for the songs to reveal.\n\nOpening with the radio friendly and funky \u201cCome to Me\u201d, The Ice Queen also features upbeat and rollicking tracks \u201cRun\u201d, \u201cThe Lucky ones\u201d (a duet with Jimmie Vaughan) and \u201cGaslight\u201d.

At the age of 21, he moved to El Paso Tx, where he began to make his way with the American public participating in programs such as \"America\u2019s Got Talent\u201d in Austin, Texas and California. In 2017 he released his first album: \u201cA New Beginning\u201d of original themes from the New Age genre, including some Waltzes, most of the pieces are inspired by moments he personally experienced or reflections. Beside Mexico and the United States, he has played in different countries such as France, Colombia, Peru, Morocco and China. A couple of years later he presents his new album: \"Feelings\" which seeks to transmit the same energy from each place he visited, and his own experiences.

The accomplished singer/songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist\u2014a true quadruple threat\u2014released her impactful and emotional debut album Symptoms last year, and it's only the beginning of her journey with a new single and more new music on the way.\n\nBorn and raised in Hawaii, the Los Angeles-based Crowe was practically brought into the world with music in her life: she started playing violin at the young age of three years old, and her father was a concert pianist alongside his career as an astronomer. \"My parents were very musical\u2014they met performing theater together,\" she explains. \"Music was a huge part of our family and my upbringing.\"\n\nAfter teaching herself how to sing while listening to Broadway musical recordings, Crowe eventually got accustomed to performing locally and accrued the confidence and motivation to try her hand at songwriting and music production, with formative influences that included Jewel and Alanis Morrissette. \"They had strong, empowering lyrics,\" she states. \"Jewel had this beautiful voice\u2014all she had to do is grab a guitar and tell her stories. That was mesmerizing to me. Alanis was all about raw, unapologetic emotion and power, and her lyrics were very dynamic while still retaining introspection.\"\n\nIn 2018, Crowe won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest for her song \"Breaking Things,\" which was co-written and co-produced with her partner and first songwriting collaborator Josh Anderson; a year later, she released her debut album Symptoms, the result of two and a half years of work with Anderson in Los Angeles on songs she'd originally written in her bedroom. \"It was my first chapter as a writer, producer, and artist,\" she states while discussing the album's origins. \"It was such a journey to have people around me and a team who could help guide me in this city.\"\n\nA deeply felt and expressive pop album, Symptoms was inspired by Lady Gaga's own approach to production and songwriting: \"She's a powerhouse performer. A lot of my production is inspired by her, along with songwriters like Sia and Taylor Swift\u2014strong women that are powerful, dynamic, and cathartic above all else.\"\n\nSymptoms' title track\u2014as well as the album as a whole\u2014draws from an abusive experience that took place before moving to the West Coast. \"After I went through that experience, my body went into shock and I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety,\" she recalls. \"It was about telling myself that everything was going to be okay\u2014and a musical diary that revealed the ways I was coping with what I'd been through.\"\n\nThe transformative \u201cChess Game,\u201d co-written by Kailey Shaffer, zeroes in on the struggles that young women in the music industry often face, as well as how to transcend and evolve amidst such struggles. As young women in our industry, we felt like we were tired of playing everyone else\u2019s games,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were inspired to write something uplifting\u2014an infectiously driven and empowering anthem in the face of adversity. The symbolism of the lyrics represents transformation, realizing your inner strength and having the courage to take back and own your true power.\u201d The song was an anthem and debuted in the Billboard Dance Charts.\n\n\"Each song is a different piece of a puzzle\u2014a symptom of who I am,\" Crowe continues. \"I took my traumatic experiences and turned them into these fun pop songs to help me get through what I've experienced.\" The latest single from Symptoms, \"Sky Is Falling,\" is particularly close to Crowe's heart; the epic, wide-open ballad finds her drawing from the pain and perseverance of her father's passing. \"It's my most personal song\u2014it encompasses all the things at the core of what I've gone through,\" she explains. I never had the chance to get any closure with him about what had happened to me, and I never got to say goodbye. All my anxiety turned into depression when he died. Because he studied the stars, the title itself is a double meaning. My world was crashing down around me, but I also wanted to make sure the song was uplifting and hopeful.\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for the single is next up, and in Crowe's words, the space-themed clip focuses on \"Finding a connection with that feeling after you experience loss\u2014with that person who may not even be there in the physical form anymore.\" What's next? More new music, starting with a duet with frequent collaborator Nick Mair, \"Can't Find Love\"\u2014as well as continuing to live through the highs and lows of existing, and helping her listeners do the same. \"A lot of things are hard to talk about that we go through, but we can all laugh and cry about it,\" she states. \"It's about letting yourself feel those emotions and coming out stronger from it\u2014feeling more self-assured about who you are.\"", "otherInfo": "NEW SHOW!\n\nWednesday May 13\n\nWe Found New Music's Livestream Series\n\nTune in at 7 PM @WFNM on Instagram\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wfnm"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Johnny Burgin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9345421.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Johnny Burgin earns his name as The Worldwide West Side Guitar Man by performing up to 250 shows a year in Europe, Japan and coast to coast in the US.

His father was an actor and folk musician and taught him the basics on guitar. He went to University of Chicago with the intention of becoming a writer, but a different path unfolded and he fell headfirst into the Chicago blues scene. Things started happening fast after Johnny (at that time featuring guest vocalist Jimmy Burns) took a Monday night residency at the Smoke Daddy in Chicago\u2019s Wicker Park neighborhood. They soon became a strong draw, and the atmosphere they generated was so electric that Bob Koester of Delmark Records offered them a contract after hearing just one set.\n\nSince those days, Johnny played the Chicago blues festival many times, toured Europe regularly, and has headlined festivals all over the US. Over the years, he has developed from a blues guitar slinger and local blues hero into a fully fledged singer, harmonica player, a dynamic and engaging bandleader, and a mature, seasoned guitarist. One look at Johnny\u2019s tour schedule confirms his status as an in-demand blues performer. He puts on the kind of satisfying and exciting show that only years of touring can develop.

At the same time, his recordings have consistently landed at the top of the New Adult Contemporary (NAC)/Smooth Jazz charts, a genre of music Tom helped pioneer in the mid-80s. As the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most renowned musical artist, Tom Grant\u2019s career achievements reflect his unique ability to embrace the full spectrum of contemporary music. Born to show business parents, Tom was at home with many musical instruments, but always returned to the piano. At a tender age, he was taught to play piano and drums by his tap dancer father. Later, he learned about music styles listening to music at his father\u2019s record store in Portland, Oregon. His brother, an avant-garde jazz pianist, introduced him to the many different facets of jazz music.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oregon and a short stint as a high school teacher, Tom answered his musical calling. Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper took Tom to New York in 1970 to record the chant classic Witchi-tai-to. After that, he toured and recorded with such jazz greats as Woody Shaw, Joe Henderson, Charles Lloyd and Tony Williams. Since 1983, Tom\u2019s records have repeatedly topped the Smooth Jazz charts.

In 2001, Tom started recording on his own record label, Nu-Wrinkle Records.

She followed it in 2014 with another critical smash: Runaway\u2019s Diary, a concept album based on her own experience as a teenage runaway, produced by Luther Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars). American Songwritercalled it \u201cboundary pushing\u2026 heartfelt, reflective, challenging and consistently compelling.\u201d NPR Music\u2019s Robert Christgau said it was her best yet.\n\nHer most recent release, Hallelujah I\u2019m A Dreamer (Archer Records, 2015), was a surprise for fans just nine months after Runaway\u2019s Diary, recorded with LaVere\u2019s husband and noted guitarist Will Sexton. On Hallelujah, Amy and Will capture the immediacy of the live show they developed on the road together, reveling in a more stripped-down sound and celebrating the freedoms and limitations that come with it in stunning form. No Depression said simply: \u201cpure bliss.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her solo records and a tireless touring schedule, Amy enjoys collaborating with other artists. In 2012 she joined an all-star collaboration called The Wandering, composed of Amy, Luther Dickinson, Shannon McNally, Sharde Thomas and Valerie June. They released Go On Now, You Can\u2019t Stay Here (Songs Of The South, 2012) to critical acclaim and sold out shows.\n\nIn the afterglow of The Wandering, Amy and Shannon McNally hit the road together and released an EP titled Chasing the Ghost, The Rehearsal Sessions (Archer Records, 2012) which featured songs from both artists recorded live during rehearsals for the tour.\n\nAmy next paired up with noted rocker John Paul Keith to create Motel Mirrors. Their styles clearly complemented one another, which made for magic on stage and in the recording studio. Their eponymous vinyl EP release was named one of the \u201c10 Essential Albums of 2013\u201d by No Depression.\n\nAlthough she\u2019s a singer and songwriter first, Amy is also an actress. In 2005 she was cast in the role of Wanda Jackson in the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line (Twentieth Century Fox). Since she has appeared in a variety of independent and studio productions: Black Snake Moan (Paramount, 2006), $5 Cover (MTV, 2009), Woman\u2019s Picture (2011) The Romance of Loneliness (2012) and most recently with Grace Zabriski in Only Child (2015).\n\nIn 2017 Amy is keeping a busy tour schedule and writing songs for a new album to be recorded later in the year.

Their live shows showcase the band\u2019s improvisational prowess and run the gambit from ethereal soundscapes to balls to the wall shredding all framed within the context of the great American songbook.\n\nThe band is supporting their latest release Hybrid, a collection of originals along with live performances showcasing the band\u2019s aptitude for improvisation. \u201cWith Hybrid they get the best of both worlds,\u201d said Chris Bell \u201cit\u2019s as close as you can get to our live show.\u201d\n\nThe band started as a way for Bell and songwriting partner Charles Etienne to continue their lifelong musical partnership. Bell had traveled to Nashville and fallen back in love with country, bluegrass and songwriting in general. When that love turned into melodies, Etienne was there to foster those ideas into finished songs. From there, what started as a one off project, blossomed to include some of the most deft players in Southern California. The musicians who added their signature sounds to those initial recordings have since become permanent and integral members of what is now The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe Alpine Camp has spread their mountain tinged roots rock far and wide since 2014. Since then they have performed at Earth Jam, the California Oysterfest, OC Music Fest and shared the stage with Atlas Genius, The Brothers Comatose, Midnight North, The Motet and Ghost Light amongst many others.\n\nThe Alpine Camp seems to think traditional roots instrumentation and exploratory rock can coexist and so do their fans. Since you can ski and go to the beach in the same day in Southern California, maybe they\u2019re right...", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "9Bach ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10349887.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "9Bach Formed in 2005 thanks to a chance meeting between Lisa (also known for her work with Gruff Rhys and Public Service Broadcasting) and Martin (Pusherman)\n\n9Bach made their name by taking traditional Welsh Folk songs and recasting them onto a spectral and haunting sound canvas.

Ever since leaving wildly successful trip-hop group Sneaker Pimps, Corner\u2019s process of becoming IAMX beginning in 2004 has been theatrical, transcendent, and communal. Androgynous and visceral, IAMX has metamorphosed from small-town blue-collar kid to international pop star in the late 1990\u2019s to creator of raw art that disrupts gender and genre in the 2000\u2019s. Fueling electronic experimentation with punk energy and confessional lyricism, Corner\u2019s dark alternative electronic sound, fashion, performances, videos, and persona are larger than life, iconoclastic, and shockingly intimate.\n\n+++ I Forget That There\u2019s A World Outside +++\nGrowing up as a self-described socially anxious geek, Corner\u2019s interest in music was stoked by a \u201cweird uncle\u201d who would play \u201cstrange music\u201d to him. Interest became obsession, and obsession a means through which Corner explored his growing fascination with technology. The interest lingers to this day, as IAMX not only writes and performs, but also produces his own music. The awkward kid who spent a lot of time in his room became the iconoclastic artist who recently spent weeks in a converted homestead in the Mojave desert staring at mountains, mining the silence around him, fastidiously regenerating the muscle memory in his fingers, and practicing, and honing his new album, Echo Echo.\n\n+++ I've Seen Attention - See Through Me +++\nCorner\u2019s adolescent curiosity moved to a new level in his teens when he connected with his older sister\u2019s boyfriend Liam Howe, who became a friend and collaborator. Their first band F.R.I.S.K. released two bedroom-produced EPs \u2013 Soul of Indiscretion, World as a Cone \u2013 that provided an early sonic template for trip-hop in general. The pair also performed as DJs under the alias Line of Flight. In 1995, Corner and Howe formed Sneaker Pimps in Hartlepool, England with support from Kelli Dayton (vocals), Joe Wilson (bass) and Dave Westlake (drums). The newly formed band took rave culture and the pop charts by storm with their 1996 debut album, Becoming X which featured dance-floor classics \u201c6 Underground\u201d and \u201cSpin Spin Sugar\u201d, sold over a million copies, led to extensive touring, and attracted the attention of Virgin Records who signed them.\n\n+++ There\u2019s Something That\u2019s Stirring Deep In Me +++\nIn 1998 the band\u2019s changing creative direction lead to Corner taking over vocals from Kelli, and Splinter was released on Clean Up records in 1999. Splinter fostered a bourgeoning cult fandom, who continued with Sneaker Pimps through the band\u2019s third album Bloodsport (Tommy Boy) and beyond. Soon, Chris realised the band was no longer the right vehicle for where his music was headed, and from this awareness IAMX was born.\n\n+++ I Know You\u2019re Aching To Be Saved +++\nEven though some of the songs on IAMX\u2019s 2004 debut Kiss + Swallow were originally slated to be on the Sneaker Pimps' fourth album, (and IAMX is itself a reference to Becoming X), shades of Chris\u2019 old life quickly faded as his theatrical and gender-bending alias emerged with full force. From 2004 onward, IAMX maintained a hectic recording and touring schedule, moving to Berlin in 2005 at the peak of its electronic renaissance. IAMX released his sophomore album, The Alternative in 2006, followed in 2008 by Live In Warsaw. Kingdom Of Welcome Addiction and its anagram remix album Dogmatic Infidel Comedown OK followed in 2009 and 2010, chronicling a dark phase in Corner\u2019s life. As dark energy seductively does, it produced compelling work, including 2011\u2019s Volatile Times and 2013\u2019s The Unified Field albums, the latter of which is considered a milestone in IAMX\u2019s creative development as a musician and performer. Eventually, however, dark energy claims its toll.\n\n+++ The World Outside May Still Be Beautiful - But I Love This Cell +++\nFollowing a successful world tour in support of The Unified Field, Corner fell into a depressive and insomniac state. His ordeals \u2013 detailed in his personal blog here \u2013 prompted him to move to Los Angeles in sunny California for a change of scenery. \u201cI stopped listening to music for about a year. I stopped making music and it was almost unbearable to listen to music. For instance, I couldn\u2019t watch TV, I couldn\u2019t even drive as it would invoke these waves of existential panic, depression, and exhaustion. I thought I would never be able to make music again but that my enjoyment of it was over. That was a very scary idea,\u201d he explained.\n\n+++ In The Sunlight And The Dust Of California +++\nThe move was a good decision and yielded one of IAMX\u2019s best albums, Metanoia in 2015 and the mini-album Everything Is Burning (Metanoia Addendum) in 2016. Having poured his heart out lyrically on two successful albums and rigorous world tours, IAMX released Unfall (German for accident), an instrumental album to cleanse his creative palette. In 2017, Corner emerged from his depression into a state of euphoria captured on his album Alive In New Light.\n\n+++ The Boys With Their Toys Are Bringing The Void Our Way +++\nIn addition to his success as a songwriter, producer, and touring artist, IAMX is one of the most licensed musicians on ABC TV\u2019s runaway hit show, How To Get Away With Murder. By the beginning of 2019, IAMX had synced 16 of his songs to its soundtrack, becoming one of the most recognizable composers on television thanks to the show\u2019s creator Pete Nowalk being a super fan of IAMX. Another super fan turned collaborator is postmodern tattoo and makeup powerhouse, kindred spirit Kat Von D, who sang on four songs on Alive In New Light and shares IAMX\u2019s avant-garde fashion and design sense, epic stage theatricality, and gender-bending proclivities. IAMX\u2019s provocative aesthetics are not limited to his music and fashion. As a video artist, he crafts IAMX\u2019s stunning live visuals and most of their music videos, as well as videos for other acts, most notably his close friend Gary Numan.\n\n+++ Echoes From The Past +++\nIn the decompression from the electro-fueled passion that had taken IAMX to 27 countries on the Alive In New Light chapter, an old yearning reawakened. 2019 was to be the year that IAMX returned to the device that had been the initiation of his odyssey as a musician. The acoustic guitar. Eleven acoustic re-imaginings of IAMX\u2019s extensive catalogue, Echo Echo heralds the start of a new yet familiar tangent in the enthralling IAMX journey, one which promises the intimacy of his songwriting laid bare.\n\n+++ The Sky Has Opened Up And Now I\u2019m Overcome +++\nIAMX isn\u2019t clear where this newfound liberation will lead him. Rising from a humble working class background to capitalistic celebrity, then down to the depths of despair and back into a new light, IAMX\u2019s armor is now more permeable and his imagination more stimulated by Los Angeles\u2019 unrelenting optimism. For Chris Corner, turned IAMX, the transformative journey that began in his bedroom as a young kid in the North East of England and found its way into the California desert continues. The I AM in IAMX may imply stasis, a fixed state of being, but the X signifies the variable in mathematics and an unstoppable metamorphosis. IAMX will continue to evolve and is fiercely committed to deliver music that transcends genre, defies the rules of the music industry and cuts straight to the heart.", "otherInfo": "***LAST IAMX LIVE ONLINE SHOW***\nAccess: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/iamxacoustic-05-14\nChris performs IAMX songs live on acoustic guitar, vocal mic and various effect/loop pedals.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends.

She capped the year collaborating with Austin Mahone on the Craig David cover, Fill Me In. Since signing with Interscope, Pia Mia has been working in the studio amassing a catalog of tracks for her soon to be released debut album. In January, 2015 Pia Mia independently released for her fans her track F**K WITH U featuring G-Eazy. The track received a strong response on Soundcloud, placing on its trending page, and with 12 million views in 3 months. It continues to play in rotation in the major radio markets, and is a DJ club favorite. Pia Mia performs the track with G-Eazy at his live shows. The track\u2019s popularity resulted in Interscope releasing the track on iTunes and the official video on Vevo. Next up, Pia Mia is set to perform live at the Power 106, LA, Powerhouse 2015 NEWAT2 stage on May 16. Her first official single for Interscope, Do it Again, featuring Chris Brown and Tyga, scheduled for release May 2015, will have a strong tropical vibe, and is expected to be this summer\u2019s hit!

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Amanda Brown ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8590333.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "R&b, Soul, Alternative Rock, Gospel, Pop, Christian/gospel, R&b/soul, Rock, Christian-gospel, Rnb-soul", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cThat quiet thud you heard across the nation as she strutted across the stage in her leather pants and bitch heels was 12 million jaws hitting the floor \u2026\u201d\n\u2013 Rolling Stone Magazine\n\nAmanda Brown has built a career out of provoking intense reactions in high places.

NME told its readers that \u201chis songs should be taught in schools\u201d; \u201cone of England's best kept musical secrets\u201d, said Rolling Stone; \u201cMelodically rich, lyrically ingenious and emotionally, intellectually affecting songs that bears comparison with the all-time greats\u201d, wrote The Guardian in their 2016 Cult Heroes feature on Bruntnell.\n\n2020 sees Peter Bruntnell re-join forces with London-based indie label Loose, to re-issue his influential and diverse catalogue, beginning in April with Peter\u2019s first 2 albums: Cannibal and Camelot In Smithereens.

It was a cozy place, filled with blue-collar workers who made their living on the water. During the weekends, many of those workers would head over to the Osborne household, where a series of loose, all-night jam sessions filled the Maryland air with the sounds of Bob Seger, Hank Williams, Tom Petty and George Jones. The Osborne siblings strummed their first chords during those jam sessions. From the very start, TJ Osborne was the brother with the voice. He sang in a thick, low baritone, crooning like Johnny Cash long before he was even old enough to drive. Older brother John, on the other hand, was the family\u2019s guitar shredder, his fingers capable of down-home bluegrass licks, arena-worthy rock riffs, country twang, and everything in between. Combined, the two Osbornes could play everything from traditional country music to rock & roll, creating a broad, full-bodied sound that would eventually fill the 11 songs on their major-label debut, Pawn Shop. Like its title suggests, Pawn Shop offers a little bit of everything. There\u2019s bluesy slide guitar, country duets, southern rock solos, harmonies, and plenty of groove. The hooks are big, the guitars are loud, and the songs \u2014 every last one of them co-written by the Osbornes, who reached out to award-winning songwriters like Shane McAnally and Ross Copperman for help \u2014 introduce a duo whose music bridges the gap between the mainstream and the alternative world. Some songs were written at home in Nashville, while others came together on the road, where the guys spent several years headlining their own club shows, touring the country with Darius Rucker, and playing some of the biggest arenas in America with fellow rule-breaker Eric Church. \u201cMost duos are built on singing,\u201d says TJ \u201cBut John is an incredible guitar player, and this band is built on me singing and John playing guitar. It gives us two parallels that work nicely together.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like an old-school rock approach,\u201d adds John, who cites classic bands like Aerosmith and the Allman Brothers as influences on the duo\u2019s dynamic. \u201cGroups like that always had the lead singer as well as the sideman guitar player. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going for, too. We\u2019re carving our own path in country music.\u201d That unique path has already led the band toward the upper half of the country charts. \u201cRum\u201d got them there first, mixing the feel-good sunshine of a beach tune with a far more realistic storyline. There\u2019s no actual beach in \u201cRum,\u201d after all. Instead, Brothers Osborne turn the song into a tribute to the simple pleasures that their Maryland hometown offers: friends, good weather, and the occasional drink. They even filmed the song\u2019s music video in Deale, filling the clip with footage of friends, relatives, and locals. \u201cMost people we grew up with don\u2019t go to these beautiful beaches,\u201d says TJ. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to do it. They don\u2019t have the time for it. What we\u2019re most familiar with is people going to the local bars and hanging out with each other.\u201d John adds, \u201cWe tried to have the biggest time possible with what little we had. \u2018Rum\u2019 explains that.\u201d The brothers agree, \u201cWe had to say it from our own perspective.\u201d A similar theme runs throughout \u201cDirt Rich\u201d and \u201cPawn Shop,\u201d two songs that stress the importance of appreciating what you\u2019ve got. Pawn Shop dishes up plenty of love songs, too, from \u201cLoving Me Back\u201d \u2014 an old-school country duet featuring vocals from Lee Ann Womack \u2014 to \u201cStay a Little Longer,\u201d the band\u2019s biggest hit to date. While a three-minute guitar solo brings \u201cStay a Little Longer\u201d to an epic, anthemic close, Brothers Osborne also devote time to more laid-back songs, from the nostalgic California country of \u201c21 Summer\u201d to the 420-friendly \u201cGreener Pastures.\u201d Brothers Osborne, who co-produced the album with Jay Joyce (the award-winning producer behind Little Big Town\u2019s Painkiller, Eric Church\u2019s The Outsiders, and Carrie Underwood\u2019s Storyteller), recorded most of Pawn Shop during breaks in their busy touring schedule, using members of their own touring band rather than session musicians from the Nashville community. The result is an album that\u2019s stamped with the unmistakable mark of a band. It doesn\u2019t sound like two singers, flanked by anonymous players. Instead, it sounds like a group of road warriors who\u2019ve spent years sharing bus seats and hotel rooms, creating the sort of chemistry that can\u2019t be faked. Pawn Shop is both raw and real, and Brothers Osborne \u2014 who, years after those household jam sessions in Deale, now have a handful of nationwide tours under their belts, songs on the charts, and a career on the rise \u2014 are no longer a family secret.

But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Built to Spill ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371631.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Built to Spill plays the songs of Daniel Johnston out this MAY.

And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Her play ground encompassed sound checks at fairs and festivals and back stage dressing rooms at a slew of different venues including the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Award shows, and her \u201cextended family\u201d consisted of managers, promoters, roadies, musicians and other fellow mainstream country artists.\n\nAt the age of 3, Alyssa performed on the Ralph Emory television show, Nashville Now. Where her version of the Leslie Gore classic; It\u2019s My Party brought the house down in front of millions of national viewers. At age 10, one of those major acts, Kenny Rogers, decided Alyssa was the perfect child singer to record a duet with him on his Christmas CD, Christmas From The Heart. By age 13, Alyssa had her first batch of songs written and received an endorsement from Gretsch Guitars. She had figured out her own unique style of guitar playing with open tunings inspired by Joni Mitchell. By age 16 she landed her first 50 date tour opening up for Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives. It soon became obvious that she was the real deal, not only as a musician and singer but as a prolific songwriter as well.\n\nWhile in high-school, Alyssa became a go-to session singer for people like Christian artist Matt Maher, where she created her own layered harmony vocal approach from years of hearing her parents sing together. Her songs started finding their way into television shows, (Switched! on ABC Family, MTV), movies, as well as getting her first cuts on other artists projects.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Alyssa received a full scholarship from Sennheiser to Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts in Liverpool England, where she would spend the next three years earning a degree in Sound Technology while continuing to perform in local venues throughout Europe. While playing at a venue called The Zanzibar in Liverpool, Alyssa was spotted by Liverpool Rock Star Pete Wylie and was asked to join his band playing electric guitar and singing background vocals. Alyssa of course said yes, and experienced what most artists never experience; a private performance requested by the Queen to help support one of Liverpool\u2019s local charities. A performance with Ringo Starr at the 800th Anniversary of Liverpool\u2019s, \u201cCapital Of Culture 2008\u201d event; a performance slot at one of the UK\u2019s largest music festivals; Knowsley Hall on the same bill as The Who, and from there on scored her own slots performing on the Acoustic stage at Glastonbury in 2009, and a UK tour opening for Raul Malo of The Mavericks.\n\nWhile at LIPA, Alyssa was inspired by their music community and the extreme amount of talented people attending the school. She lived in Lennon Studios, an apartment complex that used to be the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Her incredibly unique experiences abroad inspired her debut album, The English Diaries, an all acoustic intimate collection of songs she produced and recorded herself in her one bedroom Beatles inspired flat.\n\nAfter graduating LIPA and receiving her diploma from Paul McCartney himself, Alyssa returned to Nashville and signed her first publishing deal with Rondor Music. While signed to Rondor, she produced and released her sophomore album Love Hard which was backed by a 10k dollar Kickstarter Campaign and landed one of the biggest nationwide commercial placements of 2012 with her song, \u201cI Make My Own Sunshine,\u201d inspired by Liverpool\u2019s rainy weather. It was featured in a Lowe\u2019s commercial, earning over 50,000 downloads in its first 3 months and over 1 million plays on Spotify. She had no idea at the time that her song would later be heard by Steven Tyler and recorded on his first ever solo album, We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere and that she would be the only solo writer on his debut #1 billboard Country album.\n\nAlyssa\u2019s many other accomplishments in the singer/songwriter community include: Writing with Jeffrey Steele, Michelle Branch, Hunter Hayes, and JD Souther, writing three songs on Jessie James Decker\u2019s top 5 Billboard Country album \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d and co-writing top 40 billboard country radio single, \u201cLights Down Low\u201d, winning Canadian songwriter of the year and song of the year for \u201cI Only Smoke When I Drink\u201d by the Small Town Pistols, co-writing Jana Kramer\u2019s latest country radio single \u201cCircles\u201d and a #17 AC Billboard Chart Christmas duet with Matthew & Gunner Nelson called \u201cThis Christmas\u201d which she wrote with the twins and her father, Michael Bonagura. She\u2019s also had three #1 hits in Australia with Morgan Evans and Chelsea Basham and produced music for Jo Dee Messina & Rachel Reinert of Gloriana.\n\nAt 28 years old, Alyssa has become a songwriting seamstress for a number of artists, a producer, and a band member of the west coast folk & classic rock n\u2019 roll sounds of The Sisterhood Band with friend Ruby Stewart, all while simultaneously having a career as a solo artist. She\u2019s created life long friendships with fellow songwriters, artists and musicians, and has been called \u201cA fixture on Nashville\u2019s indie singer-songwriter scene\u201d by Rolling Stone. It\u2019s been over 4 years since she\u2019s released a solo project, but when you hear her newest record Road Less Traveled, you\u2019ll know it was worth the wait.\n\nAfter an entire summer of recording plans with an outside producer had fallen through, Alyssa turned to her boyfriend Graham Whitford for guidance on what was the best way forward for the songs she so much believed in. They decided to call long time friend and engineer Mark Petaccia to see if he was available to help record at his studio Petti Sound in Berry Hill. By a simple twist of fate, he had 7 days free.\n\nHer closest friends and family who are all a part of the Nashville underground music community decided to come together and help her create Road Less Traveled without the help of a label and purely for the love and support of their friend. The entire album was recorded live, produced by Alyssa & Mark Petaccia, Mastered by Richard Dodd and executive produced by Karen Whitford. Alyssa showcases her multi-instrumental talents by playing acoustic guitar in her signature open tunings, Piano, Ukulele, Lap Steel, Electric guitar, Bass, B3 and Harmonica. She\u2019s backed by Graham Whitford, Caleb Crosby, and Noah Denney (3/4ths of Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown), String arrangers and players Eleonore Denig and Molly Cherryholmes (Mountain Heart), Kevin McGowan, Tarka Layman, fellow artist and songwriter Davis Naish, and her father Michael Bonagura on Electric guitar.\n\nRoad Less Traveled showcases Alyssa as a solo artist in her truest form to date and shares the journey of finding her own voice and paving her own path as an independent Country artist. It encompasses elements of early Sheryl Crow mixed with Joni Mitchell like vocals. You'll hear so many iconic female influences on this project. Alyssa blends them all extremely well to come up with a sound that is familiar in its harkening back to the greats from multiple decades, yet completely unique and unlike anything else one would hear today. Road Less Traveled comes out for pre-order 8.19.16 and will be available 9.23.16.", "otherInfo": "Alyssa will be streaming from IG Live on Vox's instagram for their MiniSessions series!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Indigo Girls ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6147284.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Indigo Girls are Amy Ray and Emily Saliers.

Originally from just outside Washington, D.C., Tanya discovered her supreme vocal skills at a young age and promptly pursued a career in music and acting. Meanwhile, Michael grew up in Cleveland and D.C., spending part of his childhood in homeless shelters and later enlisting in the U.S. Army.

Justin Fabus tells a story worthy of this time-honored and timeless tradition. In his music, the singer and songwriter exudes a raw relatability between the resounding twang of acoustic guitar and robust rhythms.

Pittsburgh\u2019s a blue-collar hardworking town; I write blue-collar songs. That\u2019s country music at its core. That\u2019s who I am.\u201d\nHe also continues to make major strides through simply doing what he does. 2016\u2019s self-titled Justin Fabus soared to the Top 3 of iTunes Top Country Albums chart as he performed with everyone from Garry Allan and Randy Houser to Craig Campbell. In addition to sold out headline gigs, the 2017 CMA Music Festival showcased him as an \u201cEmerging Artist.\u201d However, he reached new heights with Remedy in 2018. Boasting collaborations with Joey Henry [Frank Sinatra, John Denver, Garth Brooks] and The Voice star Tony Lucca, it crashed the Billboard New Country Albums Chart in the Top 50. Not to mention, he landed features from Paste, AXS, All Access, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and many others.\nIn the midst of this rapid rise, Justin faced a turbulent and trying time. His mother passed away after a bout with pancreatic cancer.\n\u201cIt was definitely a rough year,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMy mom was the main reason I got into music. She was always my number one fan. It took a toll on me. I was lost. After a month, I snapped out of it, because music is all I know. I put my best foot forward.\u201d\nIn January 2019, he got a little encouragement from a legend. Tweeting about how \u201cthere needed to be a country version of New Kids on the Block\u2019s \u20182 in the Morning\u2019,\u201d Donnie replied with his blessing. So, Justin recorded his take on the tune from 2008\u2019s chart-topping, The Block. The cover caught fire online and Donnie personally invited Justin to perform it at PPG Paints Arena in front of 20,000 screaming fans when New Kids On The Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour rolled through Pittsburgh in 2019.\nIn the aftermath, Justin launched his biggest solo headline run to date the Back From Hell Tour, crisscrossing the country and packing houses. However, everything set the stage for his next original body of work.\nStripping down the sound to guitar, drums, and bass as the backdrop for the same catchy and confessional storytelling, Justin ultimately adds a new edge to country by preserving its integrity.\n\u201cI want people to listen to it and feel the pain and realness of my songs,\u201d he leaves. \u201cI\u2019m never going to write songs I didn\u2019t live or haven\u2019t gone through.

It wasn't long before he became a pivotal member of Bonnie Raitt's band, Rufus, Keith Richards & the Xpensive Winos and the Spin Doctors.

After a brief time leading a band of his own around the Minneapolis area, he moved to Austin, Texas in 1974 and formed The Fabulous Thunderbirds with guitarist Jimmy Vaughan. While ensconced as the house band at Clifford Antone's famous Austin blues club, they played with virtually all the stars in the blues firmament - Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Eddy Taylor, Big Walter Horton, Buddy Guy and many others, and the word soon spread that there was a band down in Austin that was laying down some of the toughest blues ever heard. Muddy Waters called Kim, \"The greatest harmonica player to come along since Little Walter.\" As the Thunderbirds' reputation spread, they began to record and tour around the country to ever increasing crowds.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eric Tessmer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10369668.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Blues-rock, Blues, Texas-blues Soul-chedelic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Languid guitar chords give way to Tessmer\u2019s gloomy assessment of his past life: \u201cSeems like every day\u2019s the same/ I want everything but me to change/ I don\u2019t want to be the way I am.\u201d Tessmer finally finished the song and achieved his sonic vision with the help of multiplatinum producer Sean Beavan (Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson). \u201cGood So Bad\u201d is a radical departure from the guitarist\u2019s earliest recordings--bone-dry live performances showcasing the six-string wizardry that first earned him attention when he crash-landed in Austin 15 years ago.

Shortly after, Isaiah started learning music under the close introduction of his father Michael Sharkey. He would learn about different musical genres/styles from gospel music,(which came from growing up in the church) to jazz, R&B, blues, rock and funk music. It wasn't long after that Isaiah would become noticed by other musicians in the Chicago area for being a young new talent. Soon after , he started doing concerts in the church as well as sitting in local jazz club jams.\n\nAt the age of 14, Isaiah along with his father and brothers released their first album entitled,\"Skyliner\". This album displayed Isaiah's ability to play covers and some transcriptions from greats like Wes Montgomery and George Benson.\n\nShortly thereafter, Isaiah began his recording career as well as being a sideman for musical artists in the gospel genre such as Smokie Norful, Donald Lawrence, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong and others.\n\nAt the age of 18, he began touring with Ronald Isley as his lead guitarist and shortlythereafter he secured the opportunity to record two incredible albums with him.\n\nIn 2009, Isaiah started working with 4-Time Grammy award winner D'Angelo on his third album (Black Messiah - 2016 Grammy Award Winner for Best R&B Album) which secured Isaiah a 2016 Grammy Award for his work & contribution to the project.\n\nSince then, Isaiah has worked, recorded, and toured with numerous world renown & Grammy Award Winning artists such as, Patti Labelle, Christopher Martin (Coldplay), Paul Simon, Corrine Bailey Rae, Mike Posner, Keith Urban, Brian Mcknight, Boyz Il Men, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Jennifer Hudson, Regina Bell, Ruben Studdard, Lupe Fiasco, Kelly Price, Faith Evans, Rance Allen, The Winans, The Clarke Sisters, Chris Dave and the DrumHedz, and many others.\n\nCurrently he is touring as a guitarist for John Mayer's2017The Search For Everything World Tour.\n\nNow, Sharkey is poised to finally take center stage as he fuses together his background in gospel, Jazz, R&B, Blues, Rock, and Funk to create an original sound with an unmistakable dose of soul.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pedrito Martinez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616665.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Salsa, Latin", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hot 8 Brass Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9137696.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "R&b, Hip Hop, Jazz, Funk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hot 8 Brass Band are a Grammy-nominated New Orleans based brass band, whose sound draws on the traditional jazz heritage of New Orleans, alongside more modern styles including elements of funk, hip hop, rap, and its local variation, \u201cbounce.\u201d\nTranscending genres and trends, Hot 8 have performed and collaborated with artists from Lauryn Hill, Alice Russell, Mos Def to the Blind Boys of Alabama and George Ezra and have decade long affiliations with actor/BBC 6Music DJ Craig Charles, among others. They were nominated for a Grammy in 2013 for their second album \u2018The Life and Times Of\u2026\u2019. and, with acclaimed releases such as \u2018Vicennial...\u2019, \u2018On The Spot\u2019 and \u201cTake Cover\u201d, continue to exemplify their ability to honour their city\u2019s musical traditions while forging their own powerful legacy. Hot 8\u2019s incredible tale, which comes across in their life-affirming music, has also previously featured in Spike Lee\u2019s two New Orleans documentaries, When The Levees Broke and The Creek Don\u2019t Rise, and David Simon\u2019s HBO series Treme (in which the band played themselves), to add to extensive features across the world\u2019s media.\n\nMixing an old school street brass approach with funkier currents and hip hop vocals, Hot 8\u2019s magnificent originals are juxtaposed with fresh versions of Snoop Dogg, Stevie Wonder, The Specials, Basement Jaxx and of course their anthemic take on Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cSexual Healing\u201d.\nHot 8 Brass Band\u2019s rhythms are loose-limbed and hard-hitting, with most tracks featuring a sousaphone prominently. The legendary group have established themselves as a dominant force on New Orleans streets\u2014the band you want to dance behind during a Sunday second-line parade or witness jazz funeral.\nBrass band-related activities have been a vital part of New Orleans\u2019 African American community life for over a century, serving as an important source of celebration, bonding, strength, pride, and both individual and collective expression. Jazz funerals are among the most curious and well-known New Orleans brass band customs. As an exercise of the belief in \u201crejoicing at death,\u201d the jazz funeral juxtaposes grief and joy. Slow, sad hymns and dirges are played en route to the cemetery, followed by up-tempo songs and joyous second line dancing in a final procession away from the grave.\nThe city\u2019s traditional obsession with music, parades, dancing, and the rise of black benevolent organizations, has helped to maintain and support brass band activities and culture. Dozens of benevolent societies and groups known as \u201csocial aid & pleasure clubs\u201d sponsor weekly Sunday parades. Very different from New Orleans\u2019 better known Eurocentric Mardi Gras parades, the black social club events consist of three main parts: divisions of colorfully dressed social club members, one or more brass bands and the second line\u2014a crowd of up to several thousand people who follow and dance alongside the parade throughout its several-hour duration. The free-form second line dance performed by club members and the crowd, both of whom dance with umbrellas and handkerchiefs, is derived from West African processions. The intensity that builds from the constant creative interaction between hot music and improvised dancing often erupts into a euphoric dimension in which a sense of total freedom, equality, limitless power, and a spiritual redefining of earthly reality seem to overtake all of the participants. Many legendary and influential musicians who would migrate from New Orleans by the 1920s and influence the direction of American music\u2014among them King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, and Sidney Bechet\u2014got some of their early training and experience in street parades and funerals.\nThe story of the Hot 8 Brass Band has been one of tragedy and triumph. Over the years the Hot 8\u2019s ranks have been decimated by the deaths of four original members due to street violence and illness. The devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was a life-altering turning point; during which 80% of New Orleans flooded, untold numbers of inhabitants died, and long-term displacement and misery affected hundreds of thousands\u2014raised real concerns about the survival of the city and its indigenous cultural traditions. After being evacuated, displaced, and scattered across the country, the band regrouped and began touring the United States to encourage and support other displaced Katrina victims and promote New Orleans\u2019 recovery.\nHot 8 Brass Band are signed to Tru Thoughts, based in Brighton, UK.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Samantha Margret ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10363428.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Singersongwriter, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Samantha is a singer songwriter and San Francisco native.

He went on to tour and record with Rollins in 1981 \u2013 1986 and again, recently, from 2005 \u2013 2010.\n\nBy 1981, Broom had recorded his debut as a leader, Clean Sweep (GRP Records). He relocated to Chicago later in the decade, working with Kenny Burrell, Stanley Turrentine, Charles Earland, Miles Davis, Kenny Garrett and Dr. John, among others.\n\nThroughout his career, Broom has also been active as a jazz educator. He holds a Master of Music degree in Jazz Pedagogy from Northwestern University. Currently teaching at North Park University, Broom is a former jazz faculty member of the American Conservatory of Music and DePaul, Roosevelt and Hartford Universities. He conducts clinics, master classes and lectures nationwide and abroad and is also an instructor with the Thelonious Monk Institute, Ravinia Festival Organization and Music Institute of Chicago.\n\nAs jazz artist and guitarist, Bobby has spent the new millennium refocusing on his own music, especially with his Bobby Broom Trio and the Deep Blue Organ Trio. Heralded as \u201cone of the most musical guitarists of our times,\u201d he appears worldwide and has recorded most recently for the Origin label (his Plays for Monk was released in spring 2009, The Way I Play in April 2008, Song and Dance in 2006 and Deep Blue\u2019s Wonderfu1! in 2011 and Folk Music in 2007). His upcoming trio release, Upper West Side Story, is scheduled for release in May 2012.\n\n\n\nBobby Broom Extended Biography\n\nMost musicians would be happy to experience one artistic breakthrough. Thirty years into his distinguished, wide-ranging career in jazz, guitarist Bobby Broom seems to have an endless supply of them.\n\nHis 2009 album Bobby Broom Plays for Monk hit an artistic high-water mark with its \u201cdaring arrangements\u201d (JazzTimes) and \u201csmall gems of musical discovery\u201d (DownBeat). Featuring his long-standing Chicago trio, it capped a series of recordings designed to promote Broom, celebrated for his work with Sonny Rollins and Kenny Burrell\u2019s Jazz Guitar Band, as a leader and nurturer of young talent himself.\n\nIn 2011, Broom\u2019s other working band, the Deep Blue Organ Trio, achieved commercial mass attention with its fourth album, Wonderful!, a scintillating collection of Stevie Wonder songs. A crossover triumph in the best sense, it further affirmed why Steely Dan has requested them as their opening act on tours in recent years.\n\nNow, having scored with other people\u2019s songs, Broom achieves yet another breakthrough with Upper West Side Story, his first all-original recording, which he describes as \u201can ode to where I\u2019m from.\u201d Some of the songs are recent, like the bubbly, quick-hitting \u201cFambrocious,\u201d a spontaneous studio invention that pays fond tribute to Broom\u2019s late bassist buddy Charles Fambrough. Other songs, like the surging, shape-shifting \u201cMinor Major Mishap,\u201d appeared on previous recordings. Taken together, these pieces offer a compelling portrait of the artist, who doesn\u2019t think in terms of breakthroughs himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made ten records in the past ten years and each one of them is an offering,\u201d said Broom. \u201cThey\u2019re all part of the ongoing process of creating music. But I purposely waited to make a record of all originals. I feel that can be a sort of run-of-the-mill thing to do\u2014that everyone is doing it. But, you know, I\u2019ve been out here 30 years now and people need to know who I am beyond my guitar sound and style. This album reveals more of me.\u201d\n\nHowever you chart his success, Broom now belongs to a highly exclusive club of jazz guitarists with a unique sound and pervasive influence. \u201cEvery modern jazz guitarist in Chicago is indebted to Bobby Broom,\u201d wrote Jeff Parker, the guitarist best known for his work with the \u201cpost-rock\u201d instrumental band Tortoise, in the program booklet for a 2011 concert in Europe. \u201cHe opened up the doors of perception for us all\u2014he is a master jazz stylist and a musical visionary.\u201d\n\n\u201cBroom has one of the few truly recognizable styles among modern guitarists, and one of the most satisfying solo concepts in mainstream jazz,\u201d wrote critic Neil Tesser in the Chicago Jazz Music Examiner.\n\nThe 51-year-old Broom is a role model for younger guitarists not only because he has attained such a high level of artistry with the airy density and hairpin fluidity of his improvising. He also has set a sterling example in remaining true to himself in the face of people telling him to settle for less\u2014like the agents who said he didn\u2019t have what it took to be a leader and should accept his role as a sideman.\n\nWhen Broom was a 16-year-old prodigy attending New York\u2019s High School of Music and Art and performing several nights a week with pianist Al Haig at a 62nd Street club called Gregory\u2019s, he turned down an invitation from Sonny Rollins to go on the road. Only after attending the Berklee College of Music and beginning his career back home in New York City did he accept the offer four years later. He went on to enjoy two stints (1982-1987 and 2005-2010) with the great tenor saxophonist, who recently told DownBeat, \u201cBobby is one of my favorite musicians. He explains why I like the guitar. He\u2019s got a strong musical sixth sense.\u201d\n\nBroom also flashed his independent streak when he was asked to join Art Blakey\u2019s Jazz Messengers as that legendary band\u2019s first and only guitarist. Instead of signing up, along with new recruit Wynton Marsalis, Broom joined his Queens, NY friends Omar Hakim, Marcus Miller, and Bernard Wright in trumpeter Tom Browne\u2019s popular crossover band\u2014which to his ears was making equally good music.\n\nSmooth-jazz stardom beckoned following Broom\u2019s GRP Records debut, Clean Sweep, a polished blend of jazz and urban soul on which he sang and played in the vein of George Benson\u2019s mega-selling Breezin\u2019, and the keyboard-heavy Livin\u2019 for the Beat. But Broom went in another direction, literally. In 1984, he uprooted himself from New York and, for personal reasons, moved to the Windy City, where he continued touring with Rollins, joined forces with Kenny Burrell, played briefly with Miles Davis\u2019s group, and performed with such local Chicago stalwart players as organ veteran Charles Earland and young saxophonists Eric Alexander and Ron Blake. (He also taught early on at the American Conservatory of Music and Roosevelt University and more recently at DePaul University and as part of the Ravinia Festival\u2019s jazz mentor program working with high school students.)\n\n\u201cI justified my move by intense practicing, finishing my undergraduate work, and realizing that New York was only a two-hour flight away,\u201d said Broom. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I was cutting my ties to jazz.\u201d In fact, he continued them and made new ones with his membership in the bands of people like Miles, Burrell, Kenny Garrett, and Dr. John. It was after his brief stint as a member Miles\u2019s band that he realized he had dwindling interest in playing fusion, or any music that required pedals and gizmos. He has pursued his own path since then.\n\nWith its openness to diverse musical styles and approaches, Chicago proved the perfect place to go for someone looking to establish himself on his own terms. In 1991, Broom launched his guitar trio and by 1997 had settled into a long-standing weekly gig with bassist Dennis Carroll and drummer Kobie Watkins at Pete Miller\u2019s, a restaurant/club in the northern Chicago suburb of Evanston.\n\nOn Modern Man (2001), an all-star blowing session featuring Dr. Lonnie Smith, Ronnie Cuber, and Idris Muhammad, and two albums by his trio, Stand (2001) and Song and Dance (2006, which Pat Metheny called \u201cone of the best jazz guitar trio records I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d), Broom offered smart reworkings of pop classics such as \u201cWichita Lineman,\u201d \u201cThe Letter,\u201d and \u201cLayla.\u201d He showed forethought in taking a jazz approach to non-traditional material and embracing the value of reaching wider audiences who were unschooled in traditional jazz. The Way I Play, a live set of mainstream jazz standards, followed. And then came the Monk album.\n\nBroom came close to dropping the Monk project after considering the redundancy of yet another Monk record. \u201cI wondered if there wasn\u2019t something just a bit too obvious in another jazz artist playing Monk,\u201d said Broom. \u201cThen I started to feel the challenge to do it in my own way, with the particular sound that my trio has.\u201d Never one to back down from a challenge, Broom carried on.\n\nNo such doubts accompanied the recording of Wonderful!, an idea that was waiting to happen for Broom, perennially unsung organist Chris Foreman, and drummer Greg Rockingham. Largely drawn from the \u201970s, the album features venerated album cuts like \u201cAs\u201d (from Songs in the Key of Life) and \u201cGolden Lady\u201d (from Innervisions).\n\nBroom makes no bones about the organ trio having a broader appeal than his guitar trio, which now features the exciting young drummer Makaya McCraven. \u201cDeep Blue has a much more immediately accessible sound and this very specific, built-in niche audience of organ jazz and alternative music lovers,\u201d said the guitarist. \u201cBut the guitar trio continues to excite me and when I hear that guys like Metheny and Scofield appreciate the group, then I know I\u2019ve got to keep going.\u201d The opportunity to pursue a dual career with the two exceptional bands yields its own considerable rewards. (Watkins, who on the strength of Broom\u2019s endorsement became a member of Rollins\u2019s band, plays on six of the tunes on Upper West Side Story. McCraven is featured on the other three.)\n\nAs a composer, Broom lets his ideas for songs emerge \u201cnaturally,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to find me sitting there looking for a lost chord. I\u2019m never one to force things. I can be sitting in a hotel room and suddenly, something just comes out, and as I'm writing I\u2019m thinking, where did that come from? I may not have use for the composition at that time, so I\u2019ll record it and just store it away in my computer. Maybe later on a song will suddenly stand out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened with \u2018Upper West Side Story.\u2019 I was looking for something and it was there on my hard drive. The trio learned it and we recorded it the following day. I liked that the song form seems to go in some different directions rather than the conventional patterns and I\u2019d like to do more writing like that.\u201d\n\nFollowing its fetching pop-melodic opening, \u201cUpper West Side Story\u201d gathers complexity with its hand-in-glove linear and chordal attack and steadily deepening harmonies. In contrast, \u201cD\u2019s Blues\u201d is very basic: a straight-up, three-chord blues. But the song acquires compelling shadows through the contrast of Broom\u2019s light, skimming lines and Carroll\u2019s muscular, darkly melodic tones. \u201cCall Me a Cab\u201d provides an adrenaline hit with its edgy repeating riff and loping gait. \u201cFather,\u201d a knotty Brazilian-tinged tune originally featured on Broom\u2019s 1996 Criss Cross album, No Hype Blues, acquires fresh meaning from recent events in the guitarist\u2019s life.\n\nIn a short span, Broom relocated his aging father and mother from Florida to Chicago and welcomed his new son to the world. If he ever needed inspiration, for his work and for his life, it now waits for him in the beaming smile of the impossibly cute little boy. \u201cI go into his room in the morning and it\u2019s all right there,\u201d said the proud papa, beaming himself. Breakthroughs don\u2019t get any bigger than that. \u2022", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Miss Tess ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9716909.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Early Rock And Roll, Country Blues, American Roots Music, Blues, Western Swing", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When most people think of defiant music, they think of punk rock or outlaw country.

The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama/Avi & Celia) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center. From 2013-16, Salloway toured the globe with Bombino, the Tuareg guitar hero from Niger, Africa. While on the journey and since returning, Salloway wrote the material on the band\u2019s latest album, Strike the Match (Sand & Gold Records).\n\nSalloway has been bringing these songs to life with the Wylder Family, a group of dear friends and musical kindred spirits. In between shows, the band spent ten days recording at Eyeland Studio in the Columbus Theatre, home of The Low Anthem. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert: think Andrew Bird meets Ali Farka Toure, Pete Seeger and Talking Heads. Strike the Match expands on American musical traditions, building a bridge to their African roots and coloring the songs with experimental art-rock textures: gilded string lines, synthesizers, and angular guitars. Mother Earth is at its center, surrounded by stories of love, conflict, change and dreams.\n\nSalloway shares, \u201cThis album is a reflection of the world we\u2019ve been born into, one filled with supernatural beauty and incomprehensible struggle. My social and environmental activism work has taken me to territories that have been colonized and occupied in the Middle East, North and West Africa, the South Pacific and Standing Rock, here at home. I have experienced the creative spirit rise up in the face of darkness and adversity and it is the most life-affirming feeling I have witnessed. This record has become the artifact at the intersection of these moving events in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Strike the Match, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most pressing questions of our time. How can we reorient ourselves to nature as a source of strength for resistance to the forces that seek to destroy and profit from it? How can we use music to move beyond capitalism and nationalism to a global society for the benefit of the earth and all living beings? How can we reconcile our painful history with hope and optimism for the future? The album calls the listener to engage with these questions and illuminates the path towards participating in the creation of a more just and sustainable world.\n\nThe band is named after Salloway\u2019s grandmother, Wilma \u201cBillie\u201d Hotaling.\u201d She was a prolific painter, author, musician, and educator. Billie wrote Count the Stars Through the Cracks, a harrowing historical fiction novel about a young brother and sister\u2019s escape from the Antebellum South along the Underground Railroad. Billie\u2019s writing was raw and fearless and her book delivered a powerful narrative about America\u2019s hard truths and the long journey to freedom. \u201cMy grandma Billie led by example, showing me what creativity looks like and how critical art can be as a form of love and resistance. She is part of me and part of the Wylder family,\u201d Salloway reflects.\n\n\u201cRaised in a progressive home and taught to play by Pete and John Seeger, activism is a constant in Avi Salloway\u2019s life and art. During the past decade, he\u2019s performed in world crisis spots, from the Palestinian territories to Standing Rock, always delivering a message of music\u2019s power to heal and bring change.\u201d \u2013The Hippo\n\n\"Engaging mash-up of various strains of American folk and rock and Tuareg desert blues.\" \u2013The Boston Globe", "otherInfo": "Tune in Thursday, May 14 to catch Avi playing live from his living room! https://www.facebook.com/billywylder"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Prana Crafter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8672564.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Prana Crafter session of Kosmic Psych for Hoover Public Library"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tedeschi Trucks Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8582946.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Blues & Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The 12-piece band that booms like a soul thunderclap", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/DerekAndSusan"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Milton Nascimento ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/234407.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Milton Nascimento (born 26 October 1942) is a singer-songwriter who is considered one of the icons of Brazilian Music.\n\nNascimento was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. His mother was the maid Maria do Carmo Nascimento. When he was just a few months old, the boy was adopted by the family for whom his mother had previously worked: the couple Josino Brito Campos (a banker, mathematics teacher and electronic technician) and L\u00edlia Silva Campos (a music teacher). He lived in the boroughs of Laranjeiras and Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro. When he was 18 months old, his biological mother died and he moved with his adoptive parents to the city of Tr\u00eas Pontas, in the State of Minas Gerais.\n\nIn the earlier stages of his career, Nascimento played in two samba groups, Evolussamba and Sambacana. In 1963 he moved to Belo Horizonte, and his friendship with the Borges brothers led to the Clube da Esquina (\"corner club\") movement. Other members included Beto Guedes, Toninho Horta, Wagner Tiso, and Flavio Venturini.\n\nNascimento is famous for his chime-clear falsetto and tonal range, as well for highly acclaimed songs such as \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o da Am\u00e9rica (Song from America)\" and \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Estudante (Student's Heart)\". The lyrics of \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Estudante\" remembers the funeral of the student Edson Lu\u00eds, killed by police officers in 1968. The song became the hymn for the diretas J\u00e1 campaign in 1984 and it was also played in the funeral of the late president Tancredo Neves the next year, who died before assuming the presidency.\n\nWhile his reputation within Brazil was firmly established with his Clube da Esquina works, Nascimento's international breakthrough came with his appearance on jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's 1974 album Native Dancer. This led to widespread acclaim, and collaborations with American stars such as Paul Simon, James Taylor, and Pat Metheny.\n\nThrough his friendship with guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, Nascimento came to work with the pop-rock band Duran Duran in 1993. Nascimento co-wrote and performed (in the Portuguese language) the song \"Breath After Breath\", featured on the band's 1993 album Duran Duran. He also performed with the band in concert when they toured in Brazil, in support of that album.\n\nNascimento earned a Grammy award for \"Best World Music Album\" in 1998 for his album Nascimento, and was also nominated in 1991 and 1995.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Nascimento", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Clarks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10364854.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Alt Country Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Early on, The Clarks were once described as a bunch of out of tune country hicks.

This seeker of the life-changing novel and the perfect pair of beat-to-hell boots; this connoisseur of the cool classic movie and the greasiest dive-bar cheeseburger, disciple of the museum\u2019s masterpiece and the panhandler\u2019s wiliest street-pitch? This guy who lives it, loves it, takes it all in and pours out something so tight and right you just gotta hear it again and again? Well, let\u2019s just tell it straight: Rick Brantley is a singer-songwriter who can seriously, seriously write and sing; a rocker who can really, truly rock. A young man worth listening to. Rick Brantley was born and raised in the musical mecca of Macon, Georgia, a preacher\u2019s son, soaking up the strains of gospel music, fire-and-brimstone sermons and the echoes of musical legends: Blind Willie McTell, Otis Redding, The Allman Brothers. \u201cMy Dad dug the local heroes, and was big on pop/rock hitmakers of the 70\u2019s, too, like Three Dog Night. We had a little home recording studio; music was such a part of everything\u201d, Rick says. He was also inspired by singer-songwriters like Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. \u201cYou learn from those guys and they lead you to Kristofferson, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt,\u201d he adds. Brantley learned his lessons well: barely out of high school, his own songs and red-hot band performances led to a publishing contract and new home base in Nashville. Since then, his songs have been covered by artists ranging from Meat Loaf to country crooner David Nail, while he\u2019s continued honing his stage chops as both full-tilt rock-show frontman and acoustic solo performer, opening for acts as diverse as John Hiatt, Zac Brown Band, Better Than Ezra, and Steve Earle. It\u2019s the rock side that takes the wheel for Brantley\u2019s newest EP, Hi-Fi. The six-track musical meal leans into the wind, pairing his rock howl with hope and harmonica. Beginning with \u201cFine So Fine,\u201d Hi-Fi emits a warm optimistic glow \u2013 maybe, together, we\u2019ll all be okay. It\u2019s a sentiment that\u2019s echoed throughout the record: \u201cLittle Bit More\u201d is a love call to arms, while \u201cHoles\u201d sheds sunshine on imperfections. There\u2019s something vaguely familiar about Hi-Fi, a warm orange gospel that evokes bench seats and warm steering wheels and settles snugly between nostalgia for the glory days and joy at the potential of tomorrow. Then there\u2019s \u201cHurt People.\u201d The song, which leads the EP as a single, digs deep into the gritty, sometimes uncomfortable place born of knowing someone well. It\u2019s a testament to Brantley\u2019s ever-present need to understand the world around him: he\u2019s an acute listener, and he\u2019ll tell you that getting to know people at the merch table is his favorite part of every show. In \u201cHurt People,\u201d that richness comes to life, honed in the stark depth of forgiveness by way of understanding. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone that, like [Hi-Fi producer and co-writer Mark Selby], is such a method actor,\u201d says Tia Sillers, the award-winning songwriter who co-wrote five of the six songs on Hi-Fi. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to write a song about a person, we have to go back to birth. We have to know this person\u2019s second aunt, we have to know what happened to them in fourth grade, and we have to deliberate these things.\u201d \u201cOf course all of that can\u2019t be in the song, because it\u2019s a short form\u201d Selby adds, \u201cbut the back story of these people are all there in their minds, they\u2019ve been worked out.\u201d Listening to Hi-Fi, you may just feel like a bit of your story was woven in too. So back to our original question: what to make of this talented Rick Brantley? If enough of us hear him, see him, watch him own another stage. . . well, we might just make him a household name.

You are guaranteed to laugh, cry and find hope in her message and her music. It's sort of like if you woke up and the sun was shining and someone made you coffee and brought you donuts.\n\nKatie and I have toured nonstop for 6 years. We've written four albums, been in and out of three label deals, and feel like we are just now coming into our own as songwriters, musicians, arrangers, composers, and people. We are so proud to call these women our friends. Trust us.\n\nDo not miss this show."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bleeker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9625492.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Alternative", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bleeker are steadily building a rock solid name for themselves in their native Canada. But despite an altered band name and a slightly revamped lineup, Bleeker's aesthetic and work ethic remain as sturdy and as unshakable as ever. Musically, Bleeker cross-pollinate the swagger of The Rolling Stones with psych-tinged groove, and therefore they fall among Royal Blood, The Black Keys, and Jet in the alt rock spectrum. But what sets them apart is an ever-so-subtle current of loose cannon danger that courses through every riff, note, and melody of their latest album Erase You.\n\nVocals / Taylor Perkins\nGuitar / Cole Perkins\nBass / Mike Van Dyk", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/bleekerofficial"}]
