They were inducted into the rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and have performed in approx 40 countries.\n\nThe group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called \"Rollin' Stone Blues\", and made their live debut in July 1962 at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier), replacing Dick Taylor, who started the The Pretty Things.\n\n\nIn January 1963, Charlie Watts joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham. Their weekly peformances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the \"Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone\" press campaign, which set the tone for their career, which has included drug arrests, and many notorious incidents.\n\nIn May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records, supposedly by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later \"Come On\", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.\n\nThe fifth and some say founding member of the group, Brian Jones, left officially on 8th June 1969, issuing a statement saying that he wanted to form a new group, possibly with Steve Marriott. On 3rd July 1969, around midnight Jones was found at the bottom of his swimming pool at his home in Sussex, England. The coroner reported \"Death by misadventure\", noting his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse. Some said it was suicide, others attributed foul play, even blaming Jagger and Richards for Jones state of mental depression.\n\nHe was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Another former bandmember to mention would have to be Ian Stewart (b. July 18, 1938 - d. December 12, 1985), who officially was in Brian Jones new group prior to even Mick or Keith, but according to legend was squeezed out of the band at Andrew Loog Oldham's suggestion in the early 1960's. Stu was considered by many as the 6th member, and still regularly played piano onstage with the group for many years, steadily at every gig on every tour until 1971, and on & off through 1982 when he was also employed as \"road manager\".\n\n\nIn 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label originally distributed through Atlantic, an arrangement which lasted a decade.\n\nIn December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career. He was replaced in 1975 by Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood.\n\nThe Stones became one of the world's most popular touring groups, routinely playing huge sports arenas and stadiums, pioneering mobile recording, corporate sponsorships, and setting records for ticket prices.\n\nBill Wyman left the fold, and was replaced shortly before the group began the Voodoo Lounge stadium tour in 1993. Current bassist Darryl Jones, born in 1961 only a year before the group started, is not an \"official\" band member, but has played bass in the band for more than 15 years.\n\n\nAll the \"official\" members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds.

He has been seen outside venues at 3am in Germany playing an acoustic guitar and singing to people that didn\u2019t want the show to end. He has written poems to fans from behind bars whilst locked up on bogus marijuana charges. He has suffered a spiral fracture of the humerus while arm wrestling a marine in Hawaii. He has recorded with and toured alongside some of independent rap music\u2019s most influential figures, including Sage Francis, Busdriver and Astronautalis. He has been in bands described as hardcore, crunk rap, lo-fi synth pop, Latin progressive and psych-jazz-rap. He has crafted abstracted and personal narratives mining the depths of depression and heights of hope. He has slept on countless floors when hotels weren\u2019t in the touring budget and lost girlfriends and jobs all for the love of creating and performing.\n\nCeschi was born with four fingers on his right hand, which served as partial inspiration for the name of his DIY record label, Fake Four, Inc. Those who have worked with him describe Ceschi as one of the most artist-friendly labelheads out there, a rare breed who values art over profit almost to a fault. Since 2008, he has curated a roster of wildly original and critically praised talent and put out albums from the likes of Open Mike Eagle, Buck 65, Sister Crayon and Dark Time Sunshine in addition to his solo records The One Man Band Broke Up and Broken Bone Ballads.\n\nAn engaging, theatrical live performer, Ceschi Ramos has treated entire venues like a stage, viewing the middle of the audience or an empty barstool as good a place as any to perform a soul-baring folk song or tongue-twisting rap track. Ceschi once described himself in song as \u201ca martyr at most\u2026 a failure at least\u201d and said that, \u201cIn the eyes of history I\u2019ll be no more than a leaf on a tree.\u201d He knows what it is to suffer for his art and is aware that music exploring the ugliness and sorrow of the human condition will always exist on the fringes of a game dominated by disposable escapism and expensive publicists. Yet he still pours everything he has into his craft, and on any given night you can find him tracking vocals at his cousin\u2019s New Haven studio, warmly greeting fans and friends at a dive bar merch booth or rapping double-time in Japan or Europe for audiences that often don\u2019t speak his language, but are able to see the giant heart at the core of it all.", "otherInfo": "Every year I throw myself a public birthday party with as many amazing musicians, songwriters, and entertainers as I can pull together.

Platt is as good a songwriter as anyone with an Americana label by their name and that includes Isbell and Lucinda to name just two of them\u2026 You will need to listen repeatedly as the album is lengthy and Platt\u2019s lyrics are so damn real and relatable on so many levels.\u201d --Elmore, Jim Hynes\n\n\u201cThey\u2026 deliver a feisty, witty, hard-knock life realism on their records and this eponymous release, their fifth, is like the continuation of a classic serial novel you just can\u2019t put down\u2026 My favorite track is \u2018Eden\u2019 and I must have listened to it at least five times because it\u2019s just bloody brilliant, cheeky and slightly heart-wrenching all at once: \u2018Don\u2019t keep a TV \u2019cause the news is always bad and it teaches us to want all the things we\u2019ll never have\u2019 and then the storyteller asks to be let \u2018back inside that garden, I won\u2019t eat anything that\u2019s fallen from that goddamn tree.\u2019 --That Mag, Jane Roser\n\n\u201cPlatt can find a tune and express it exquisitely with a distinctive voice and a sympathetic band\u2026 Her wonderful lyrics seem to be an assessment of the people and circumstances that surround her to find the good bits.\u201d --Americana Music Show, Tony Ives\n\n\u201cPlatt opens with the reflective \u2018Birthday Song\u2019, warmed in among other things, tasty piano the album is immediately up and running on greased wheels. Blending country with folk and country pop you have Americana music with a capital \u2018A\u2019 and it is good!\u201d --Flying Shoes Review (UK), Maurice Hope\n\n\u201cPlatt sings like she means it on this country-tinged folk album, and whether or not her nuanced lyrics are drawn directly from real life, they sure sound as if they are... Platt\u2019s vocals convey joy and tenderness and her band provide amiable backup. At its best, this music is on a par with Lucinda Williams\u2019s, which is saying a lot.\u201d --The Morton Report, Jeff Burger\n\n\u201cThere is, as with the two before, an easygoing warmth to the album, and a certain kind of knowing. The kind from that comes from being a keen and empathetic observer. From the upbeat \u2018Diamond in the Rough\u2019 to the poetic \u2018Eden\u2019 to the solemn \u2018Long Ride,\u2019 Platt and her band flesh out all that's real and been missing in country music for lo these many years.\u201d --No Depression, Amos Perrine\n\n\u201ca gem of an album\u2026 The collection combines sharp and emotive songwriting with crisp production values. A successful blend of country roots and honky-tonk, but with a defining Appalachian twist. Above it all hovers Platt\u2019s voice \u2013 laconic, sultry, pitch perfect and ultimately charming.\u201d --Listening Through The Lens, Rob Dickens\n\n\u201cAmanda Anne is one of the best songwriters I have ever heard \u2013 and I have been listening carefully to music for about 55 years. She writes with her heart and her brain and her observations on life, love and other matters of importance are sparkling ... Her songs get into your blood and become a part of you.\u201d --letter from David Whittaker who commissioned the song \u201cRare Thing\u201d for his wife Holly\n\n\"Amanda is so good it's ridiculous. I don't even know what words to use. Her singing, songwriting and presence is unmatched in Americana, Country, Pop\u2026 Simply breathtaking.\" --Saul Davis: producer (Percy Sledge), manager (Gene Clark, Carla Olson, Phil Seymour)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s soothing (even in the hurtin\u2019 songs) and sobering (except for the drinkin\u2019 songs) and nuanced in a way that I think tops even those rather famous ladies of the moment named Margo and Kacey\u2026 I\u2019d be hard pressed to find a finer string of recordings from any band working in the classic country/mountain tradition in these last five years.\u201d --Music City Roots, Craig Havighurst\n\n\n\u201cPut simply, the Honeycutters are one of the best alt-country bands in the region. If you like Kim Richey and Lucinda Williams, you\u2019ll love Honeycutters singer/songwriter Amanda Anne Platt, who mixes a lazily sensual voice with a storyteller\u2019s eye. If you like prime-period Steve Earl, you\u2019ll love the Honeycutters genre-bending rock & twang.\u201d --Greenville, Journal, Vincent Harris\n\n\u201cAsheville\u2019s Amanda Anne Platt is an amazing songwriter, penning heartbreaking country tunes better\nthan most coming out of Nashville. The band\u2019s take on Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d is at once\ncompletely original and familiar.\u201d --WDVX Music Director Nelson Gullet\n\n\u201cAmanda Anne Platt is another of those hugely multi-talented artists that don\u2019t get anything like the credit or rewards that they deserve. She is the lead singer and main songwriter for The Honeycutters, another band that have provided the musical background to my year.\u201d --Your Life in A Song (UK), Top 10 Country Albums Of 2016\n\n\n\u201cThe songwriting alone, all of it from the pen of Amanda Anne Platt, stretches the scope of this recording [On The Ropes] beyond a standard honky tonk format. She is completely unafraid to tackle difficult aspects in and around love found and love lost with her incredibly descriptive writing style that opens up the emotions to the listener as if their own. Listening to the lyrics you can't help but hope most of the stories are fictitious and hopefully not from her own life, such is the depth of some of the sadness.\u201d --Americana Roots (UK)\n\n\u201cLike all great songwriters, Platt's characters are alive, with enough nuance to convince the listener that they have entire lives outside the glimpse they get from the songs\u2026 there's a delicate balance of melancholy and hope that takes a deft hand to pull off without sounding cliched. Platt's hand is that deft.\u201d --Examiner, Chris Griffy\n\n\u201cTheir songwriting is first rate, their arrangements and instrumental ability in top form and with a front woman as assertive and impressive as singer Amanda Anne Platt\u2026 clearly, Platt and her colleagues\u2026 have every contingency covered.\u201d --No Depression, Lee Zimmerman\n\n\u201cThis album damn near beats anything coming out of Nashville\u2019s country mainstream these days. The real-life lyrics and the subtle playing of the Honeycutters will insinuate themselves into your psyche like the whispered reassurances of an old friend, touching your heart and opening your eyes to the bittersweet joys and sorrows of everyday life\u2026 Spit out that modern country-pop diet soda and pour yourself some of the real stuff. Bottoms up!\u201d --Alan Cackett (UK)\n\n\u201c12 original songs and probably the best version of \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 you\u2019ll ever hear \u2013 make this NC-based band a must-hear\u2026 From the first moments of the lead-off track On The Ropes you\u2019ll find yourself hooked \u2013 and the music won\u2019t let you go\u201d --Amazon, Steve Ramm, 5 Star Review\n\n\u201cAn album that shines like a good deed in a naughty world.\u201d --3rd Coast Music, Johnny Conquest\n\n\u201c\u2018Blue Besides\u2019 is a superb song. If it was recorded by Miranda Lambert, it would go to number one. It will remain an album track because that\u2019s the way of the world. They are dominant in their field. Underground Americana that seems to be gravitating towards Asheville in North Carolina which happens to be The Honeycutters\u2019 home town.\u201d --Your Life in A Song (UK), Top 10 Country Albums Of 2016\n\n\u201cPlatt\u2019s voice is fair magical. Clearly annunciated, every word is infused with poetic loveliness, made all the more appealing for the slight twang that causes syllables to rise and fall at the end of lines. Like Joy Lynn White once upon a time and Zoe Muth more recently, Platt can sing of desperation and despair while retaining pride of steel... throughout On the Ropes Platt delivers personal devastation that touches universally.\u201d --Lonesome Road Review, Donald Teplyske\n\n\u201cHer songs are poignant, funny in an everyday sort of way, heartfelt, and authentic. The Honeycutters\u2019 On The Ropes is a good friend when you need one the most.\u201d -- Americana Music Show\u2019s Calvin Powers Listed On The Ropes as the #1 in the Best of Albums in 2016\n\n\u201cWhile her country-flavored songs almost always tell a story, The Honeycutters\u2019 musical approach adds a dimension to the tunes that only widens their appeal.\u201d --Mountain Xpress, Bill Kopp\n\n\u201cPlatt is a gifted songwriter and vocalist. Here, as on the fine previous release, Me Oh My, she is clearly the leader. She has an authoritative, confident voice that can be sweet, aching, and joyous, sometimes even in the same song. Platt\u2019s voice and the interplay of the guitar and mandolin give this band their unique complex sound \u2013 a clear-sounding mash-up of Americana, bluegrass, folk, and honky-tonk.\u201d --Elmore Magazine, Jim Hynes\n\n\u201cForget Nashville, with their buzz-making brand of rock-roots-country, the Honeycutters are out to make Asheville, NC the brand new music city.\u201d --Elmore Magazine\n\n\u201cAll of those sad little pop singers need to get off country radio and let the Honeycutters take it from here. When I heard this album I felt the same way I felt when I first heard Emmylou Harris and the Hot Band.\u201d --Western Free Press, Skyler Miller\n\nWatch The Honeycutters \u201cThe Only Eyes\u201d live on Music City Roots 11/2/16 \u2192 https://youtu.be/6URrj86A86M\n\nListen to The Honeycutters on Mountain Stage.

Her magnetic presence, exuberant energy and genuine smile bring a warm authentic charm to the blues scene. With her bed as a stage and hairbrush for microphone, she started singing at the age of 6 accompanied by her mother\u02bcs 45s on her Mickey Mouse turntable. By the age of 11 her bed was replaced by a stage and by 22 she was touring the country as the lead in the National tour of Hair.

Country Artist JD Shelburne grew up on a tobacco farm in Taylorsville, KY, a tiny town southeast of the Ohio River near Louisville KY. At age 19, he found a guitar after the death of his grandmother and began learning to play and sing on his own. By his sophomore year of college, he had found a few gigs at some local bars in the Louisville/Lexington, KY area and developed a fan-base that eventually landed him on some of the biggest stages in the business, opening for some of the nation\u2019s hottest stars. Eventually, Shelburne was adding original songs into the set mix, in addition to producing songs of his own material.\n\nIn 2002, Kentucky fell in love at first sight with Shelburne, then college student/ small-town country boy with a wide smile, natural singing voice and a love of faith, family and his hometown of Taylorsville, KY. But that small-town image is merely a fond memory now that he has moved on to Nashville down the path to music stardom.\n\nNow find him soaking up the music scene, touring cities, building a fan-base and celebrating a decade of success playing venues all across the southeast trying to get his big break. Today he\u2019s among the most hard working and relevant country singers in the business. They say Nashville doesn\u2019t work that way anymore \u2013 that talented musicians with very few connections don\u2019t stand a chance. But Shelburne proved that Music City\u2019s engine still runs off of talent and persistent driven antics. Critics find him credible. Fans pack his shows. Venues strive to book him. There are very few new artists recording songs today about whom that can be said.\n\nDuring his whirlwind career explosion, he has performed with over 50 national acts ranging from stars such as Montgomery Gentry, Craig Morgan, Jamey Johnson, Kellie Pickler, Steve Wariner to Clay Walker and Johnny Lee, performed at some of the region\u2019s most famous venues such as the Historic Ryman Auditorium, Rupp Arena, Murphy Center, KFC Yum Center, Freedom Hall, Churchill Downs and Old Cardinal Stadium which recently drew the Kentucky State Fair\u2019s largest crowd of the concert series. Shelburne performed \u201cGod Bless America\u201d prior to the 2016 Quaker State 400 NASCAR race at Kentucky Speedway to over 100,000 attendees. He has also been featured in Country Weekly Magazine, Kentucky Alumni Magazine, Kentucky Monthly Magazine amongst many other national publications including the Huffington Post. His debut music video \u201cFarmboy\u201d gained him thousands of new fans by airing on the TNN Top Ten Countdown nationwide on Heartland TV network and ZUUS Country Network. In 2015, he made his Nationwide debut on GAC \u2013 Great American Country Network and also CMT.com in October with his second music video entitled \u201cHometown\u201d written about the demise of his smalltown. On October 21, 2015, Shelburne debuted as #1 trending artist on CMT.com edging out Taylor Swift, Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean! Shelburne has performed over 1000 concerts all over the southeast as well as over 300 festivals. Shelburne\u2019s outfit has been featured on display at the Kentucky Derby Museum at Historic Churchill Downs from his appearance at the 2015/2016 Kentucky Derby. In 2016, Shelburne was invited to perform in the Kentucky State Capitol for the State Senate as well as the House of Representatives where he performed his own rendition of \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home\u201d for both parties. JD was named an Honorable Kentucky Colonel and was also presented honor of \u201cAdmiral\u201d by the Commonwealth of Kentucky \u2013 Energy and Environment Cabinet recently. Also in 2016, the University of Kentucky\u2019s College of Communication and Information named JD Shelburne their 2016 Most Outstanding Alumnus!\n\nMost recently in 2017, Shelburne launched his world premiere official music video for \u201cBetter Man\u201d that was filmed in Midway/ Millville, KY. The video also made it\u2019s Network Television Debut on Great American Country (GAC) on June 23, 2017 and is currently in Nationwide rotation.

They've played their shows, developed their sound, released their records and very quietly built a massive fan base in the process.\n\nWhat makes this band different from all the others is that their local fan base includes Bruce Springsteen, David Bryan, and Steve Cropper, all of whom have volunteered to perform on the band's album, Brotherhood.\n\nPrior to Brotherhood's release, Matt's talent was recognized globally when he got the nod to join rock legends Bon Jovi as their guitarist/backing vocalist on their 2015 stadium tour of the Far East.\n\nWhen some of your biggest supporters have sold over 200 million units, you know you're doing something right.\n\nIn addition to being a creative songwriter, Matt was recognized by the industry as a guitar great after winning a national guitar contest hosted by B.B. King and John Mayer through Guitar Center and Guitar World magazine. Matt beat out over 4,000 competitors to win the grand prize which consisted of multiple guitars, an endorsement from Gibson, a shopping spree at Guitar Center and a new car from Scion. This major accomplishment was the spark that jumpstarted his career and gave his band momentum for their future success.\n\nGrowing up on influencers ranging from Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Rory Gallagher, ZZ Top, Robin Trower, Joe Walsh, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Matt O'Ree Band has taken all these diverse elements and forged a new iron.\n\nMatt's writing is inspired by many life experiences and years of study from the ones that have written the book on how to play real guitar rock music. Not as a photocopy, but in a new light that hasn't been seen in quite some time. Now is the time for real music and real musicianship to make a resurrection.\n\nRecently, the band has been promoting two new singles \"Without You\" and \"Through Time With You\" co-written and produced by John Ginty, B3 Organ player for the Allman Betts Band and the Dixie Chicks. The songs are an indication that the band is moving in a new direction forming a powerhouse team, blending Eryn's soulful vocals with Matt's gritty vocals and unparalleled guitar. Together these two front an incredible sound where the audience can feel the sparks between them. The chemistry on stage is unstoppable.\n\nEryn is an accomplished artist in her right. She won awards such as the BELK Southern Musician Showcase/Blues Artist as well as Asbury Park's Top Female Vocalist and Top Blues Band. She is also the youngest artist to be inducted into the NJ/NY Blues Hall of Fame and one of only three females who have been inducted. She has performed or opened for artists such as Don McLean, Gregg Allman, Johnny Winter, Robert Cray, Dr. John, Shemekia Copeland, The Gin Blossoms, Little River Band, Marcia Ball, Walter Wolfman Washington, Eric Lindell, Sonny Landreth, The Radiators, Johnny A and so many more. She also recently sang backup vocals with the Smashing Pumpkins on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nTogether, the band takes their fans on a ride that hasn't been heard or seen at this level since the '70s. Their live show is like revisiting a Zeppelin concert at the Garden, and with Lex Lehman's smooth soulful bass, John Hummel's Bonham-esque drums, and Eryn's angelic and gutsy lead and backing vocals, Matt and company have built a foundation that can hold up the biggest house on the block.", "otherInfo": "Matt O\u2019Ree Band Live from Sofa Stage!\n--------------------------------\n\nMOB family- it\u2019s spring cleaning time!\nJoin Matt & Eryn 7pm EST for an acoustic Qtine house party and live Q+A from the comfort of your sofa.\n\nStreaming available on Facebook, YouTube, Mixer, and Twitch.\n\nVIRTUAL TIP JARS\n-------------------\nVenmo: @matthew-oree\nPayPal / Zelle: mattoree@mattoree.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "May Erlewine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9334351.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Traditional Folk, Soul, Jazz, Bluegrass, Roots, Old-time Country, Swing, Americana", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "May Erlewine has split her heart wide open and hasn\u2019t hidden any of the contents from view.\n\nOne of the Midwest\u2019s most prolific and passionate songwriters, May\u2019s gift for writing empathetic and engaging songs that feel at once fresh and soulfully familiar has earned her a broad, devoted fan base well beyond her deep-set Michigan roots. May\u2019s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.\n\nRaised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nErlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country, swing, soul, and even rock n\u2019 roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.\n\nWith a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine\u2019s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC\u2019s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys, and others.\n\nErlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in our world. May's body of work has become an anthem and an example of why we need to listen to women, and why we need to hear their stories.\n\nMay\u2019s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times. When she starts to sing, there\u2019s no way around it: welcome in, everyone.

When given a stage from which to sing, he simply soars.

Audiences are immediately transfixed then transported, but that is just the beginning of the show: there is more in the world of Workman Song by which to be mystified still.\n\nMcMahon, a self-deprecating would-be preacher whose unconventional Christian faith can be spotted hiding in plain sight at the center of his lyrical storytelling, is something of a renegade revivalist and mystic after the order of John Lennon, dropping quirky koans and non-linear parables happenstance whilst tuning his guitar between songs or in convoluted liner notes for concept records written under various Workman \"sub-personae\" such as Ion Zelig or Ruben Smiley.

But even in their most exasperated moments, the Brooklyn-based punk trio sustains a ferocious energy and untamed joy, ultimately turning every song into a wildly cathartic anthem.\n\n\u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stifled in silence, but then the song itself is an answer to that,\u201d says Black. \u201cIt\u2019s us saying, \u2018I have my opinion, and I\u2019m going to share it no matter what.\u2019 Instead of keeping things all bottled up, it feels so much better to face everything head on, and just be really loud about it with your two best friends.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to their 2019 self-titled effort\u2014THICK\u2019s third EP and first release for Epitaph Records\u20145 Years Behind came to life at Studio G Brooklyn with producer/engineer Joel Hamilton (Iggy Pop, Jolie Holland). In a departure from their previous work, the band took a more spontaneous approach to the album-making process, sometimes completely reworking songs at the eleventh hour in order to channel the most immediate emotion into each track. \u201cIt was really important to us that the songs feel emotionally connected to our reality, so that it feel as natural as possible to play them,\u201d notes Black.\n\nAs a result of fearlessly following their instincts, THICK manage the impossible feat of coming off confident and carefree even as they expose their deepest insecurities. On the album\u2019s dynamic yet delicate title track, for instance, the band shifts from furious intensity to harmony-soaked melancholy as they reflect on certain overwhelming societal pressures. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we always feel five years behind in life, at least as far as the expectations of the world around us,\u201d says Sisti. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re constantly battling, but at the same time we know that there\u2019s no real timeline\u2014there\u2019s no time limit for doing what we want to do.\u201d\n\nTHICK\u2019s most politically charged work to date, 5 Years Behind offers up tracks like \u201cMansplain\u201d\u2014a blistering, brilliantly sarcastic takedown bookended by a sound collage of massively infuriating comments from men (e.g., \u201cGirl bands are really in right now,\u201d \u201cHere, let me help you carry your amp,\u201d \u201cAre those your boyfriend\u2019s drums?\u201d). \u201cThose are all things that men have actually said to us or our friends at shows,\u201d Page points out. On \u201cFake News,\u201d the band lets loose a 49-second blast of pure punk vitriol, spiked with scathing social commentary. And on \u201cBumming Me Out,\u201d 5 Years Behind delivers a bouncy but bittersweet epic that perfectly captures the pain of feeling powerless in the face of endless horrors happening in the world (sample lyric: \u201cNever knew I\u2019d be so tired/Fighting for what I believe\u201d).\n\nClosing out with the unrestrained fun of \u201cParty With Me\u201d\u2014as in \u201cJust take your clothes off and party with me/In the backyard of New York City\u201d\u20145 Years Behind also finds THICK looking back on their early days and on the increasingly endangered all-ages scene that birthed the band. To that end, the tenderly detailed \u201cWHUB\u201d unfolds as a heavy-hearted tribute to \u201call the DIY venues that are shut down now,\u201d as Page puts it. All originally from New York State, THICK\u2019s three members forged their friendship in those venues, with Sisti and Page forming the band in 2014 and Black joining the lineup two years later. Along with playing live as often as they could\u2014and purposely focusing on DIY/all-ages spaces all around New York\u2014THICK made their debut with the 2016 EP It\u2019s Always Something\u2026, put out their sophomore EP Would You Rather? in 2018, then signed with Epitaph later that year. \u201cFor a long time we didn\u2019t have management or a booking agent or anything\u2014we just worked our butts off and stayed true to ourselves, and it got us to where we are now,\u201d says Sisti.\n\nOver the years, THICK have earned recognition as an unstoppable live act, with their show typically spawning a mosh pit described by Stereogum as \u201cmore like an aggressive hug.\u201d As they dreamed up the tightly crafted yet uncontainable sound of 5 Years Behind, the band kept the live experience at the forefront of their minds. \u201cWhen we write, we write toward the emotions of the audience,\u201d says Sisti. \u201cI know that lyrics play a huge role in connection, but I\u2019m personally more focused on visualizing how people might physically respond to a song\u2014what it would make them feel in the moment and how it might make them move or dance.\u201d\n\nNow gearing up for a national tour in support of 5 Years Behind, THICK aspire to strengthen the palpable sense of inclusivity that\u2019s defined their shows from the start. \u201cWe want people to feel safe in the mosh pit, and hopefully connect with each other,\u201d says Page. \u201cWe\u2019ve made so many friends at the shows we\u2019ve played, and we\u2019d love it if people could build some kind of community from coming to see us.\u201d And in the making of their first full-length effort, THICK aimed to instill an undeniable feeling of solidarity into each of the album\u2019s tracks. \u201cIn a way the theme of all our songs is: \u2018We\u2019ll get through this. We\u2019re not going to be kept down,\u201d says Black. \u201cI hope when people listen to the album, it gives them that same feeling. And I hope they feel like, if they ever needed it, we\u2019d absolutely have their back.\u201d\n\nNikki Sisti (guitar, vocals) - Kate Black (bass, vocals, guitar) - Shari Page (drums, vocals)", "otherInfo": "THICK will be performing live on The Noise's Instragram"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim O'Brien LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8414491.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "International, Celtic, Folk, Country, Americana, Bluegrass", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born in Wheeling, West Virginia on March 16, 1954, Tim O\u2019Brien grew up singing in church and in school, and started playing folk and rock music on guitar at age 12. After seeing Doc Watson on TV, he became a lifelong devotee of old time and bluegrass music.\n\nHe started making his living as a musician at age 19 in Chicago and in Jackson, Wyoming, eventually relocating to Boulder, Colorado in the fall of 1974. O\u2019Brien found work there as a fiddler with local bluegrass bands and as a member of the Ophelia Swing, recording with them and with Pete Wernick in 1977. In those early Colorado years, he started playing the mandolin, and studied guitar and music theory with local jazz great Dale Bruning.\n\nIn 1978, Tim co-founded the bluegrass group Hot Rize with Pete Wernick, Charles Sawtelle, and Nick Forster. Hot Rize and Western Swing alter-egos Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers eventually recorded ten albums and toured the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia. The group was named Entertainer of the Year 1990 by the International Bluegrass Music Association, and their \"Colleen Malone\" was named IBMA\u2019s Song of the Year in 1991. He won IBMA\u2019s Male Vocalist of the year in 1993, and again in 2005, when he also won song of the year for \"Look Down That Lonesome Road\".\n\nSolo recordings started with 1982\u2019s \"Hard Year Blues\", and other projects included three duet albums with his sister Mollie O\u2019Brien. Folks in Nashville started noticing Tim\u2019s songs, and he had top ten country hits in 1989 and 1990 with Kathy Mattea\u2019s versions of Hot Rize songs \"Walk The Way The Wind Blows\" and \"Untold Stories\". Other notable covers by New Grass Revival, Nickel Creek, Garth Brooks, and the Dixie Chicks followed. Hot Rize went dormant in the spring of 1990, after which O\u2019Brien performed and recorded on his own, eventually releasing fourteen solo recordings, as well as collaborations with Dirk Powell (\"Songs From The Mountain\") and with Darrell Scott (\"Real Time\"). Landmarks solo releases include a Grammy nominated set of bluegrass Dylan covers \u2013 \"Red On Blonde\", the Celtic/Appalachian fusion of \"The Crossing\", and 2005\u2019s Grammy winning \"Fiddler\u2019s Green\".\n\nTim toured and recorded with Steve Earle\u2019s Bluegrass Dukes in the early 2000\u2019s, and with Mark Knopfler in 2009 and 2010. Other recent collaborations include another CD with Darrell Scott (\"Memories and Moments\"), a track with Steve Martin (\"Daddy Played The Banjo\"), a family band set of Roger Miller songs (\"Reincarnation\"), and the reunited Hot Rize\u2019s \"When I\u2019m Free\". A collaboration with Jerry Douglas, Shawn Camp and others -\"The Earls Of Leicester\" - won a Grammy as well as IBMA\u2019s Record of the Year in 2015.\n\nTim has produced recordings for Laurie Lewis, the Yonder Mountain String Band, the Infamous Stringdusters, Old Man Luedecke, and early mentor J.D. Hutchison. He has recorded and performed with The Chieftains, Joan Baez, Dierks Bentley, Bill Frisell, and the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra. He contributed to the movie soundtrack of \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" as well as those of \"Cold Mountain\", and \"The Blob\". He is a former president of the International Bluegrass Music Association, and currently serves on the board of the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame. O\u2019Brien formed his own record label, Howdy Skies Records, in 1999, and in 2015 launched the digital download label Short Order Sessions (SOS) with his partner Jan Fabricius. SOS releases a new track every month. He has two sons, Jackson and Joel , and has lived in Nashville since 1996. Hobbies include cooking, skiing, and playing traditional Irish music.\n\nTim's latest release, 2017's \"Where the River Meets the Road, is O'Brien's 16th solo recording.

A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area.

The Colorado-based saxophonist/producer, Dominic Lalli and drummer, Jeremy Salken, are veterans of blending electronic dance music with their live instruments to create Big G's truly unique sound; a sound that is as thoughtful as it is danceable. Big Gigantic mixes musically mature melodies with addictive beats and samples, that are familiar to a Kanye West or LCD Soundsystem single, and crosses all styles of music from jazz to hip hop, funk to dubstep.\n\nTheir fifth most recent studio album, Brighter Future, reflects Lalli and Salken\u2019s vision for uniting the world through music and community. Lalli wrote, \u201cNow more than ever, we need to come together and work towards a brighter future for us, our children and for the human race as a whole.\u201d The album was released on August 26, 2016 and features special guests Waka Flocka Flame, Logic, Cherub, Griz, Pell, and many more.

After donating tens of thousands of dollars, school supplies, food and other items to those in need through their #ABigGiganticDifference initiative, Lalli and Salken have taken their give-back mission to the next level. In Fall of 2016, the duo founded the nonprofit A Big Gigantic Difference Foundation with the mission to spread positivity and enact change alongside their fans and community through #ABDG events, fundraising initiatives, and donations from ticket sales.\nIn 2017, they switched their model of giving many small gifts for a greater impact large donation.

His father, however, was a recording studio owner. Wanting to give his son a hands-on business experience, Mr. Rivera hired his son Lupillo to work at the studio.\n\nLupillo was given the task of looking for local talent at bars, with the idea that some of that talent could be signed by his father's company. It was while searching for talent that he met the now deceased Chalino S\u00e1nchez, father of Ad\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez Also now deceased.\n\nLupillo's uncle was a semi-famous professional boxer, known as El Toro Rivera to Mexican boxing fans. In 1990, Lupillo discovered that he could sing, and he began performing under the nickname of \"El Toro del Corrido\" (\"The corrido's bull (r)\"), as a homage to his uncle.\n\nBy 1993, Lupillo began to sing using his own name. By then, he had already signed with Sony Discos.\n\nHis star began to rise meteorically at that point. In 2001, he was awarded a Premios lo Nuestro.\n\nIn Juarez, Chihuahua, while he was driving to a concert location, his SUV flipped over. He required hospitalization. Months later, Ad\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, a years-long friend who had grown to admire and become like a little brother to Lupillo, died at the age of nineteen in another car accident, leaving Lupillo Rivera devastated.\n\nIn 2004, a Marine who died in Iraq had requested for Lupillo to sing at his funeral should the soldier die, and Lupillo complied with the request, leaving one of his famous sombreros on the Marine's burial casket during the funeral.\n\nRivera has been involved in controversy, tying him romantically to different women. Some women he has been linked to claim to have children from him. On April 29, 2006, he married the mother of one of his daughters.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Arielle Silver LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10247758.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Americana, Indie Folk, Alt-country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Arielle Silver crafts songs that are luminous, literate, and alive. A Thousand Tiny Torches, the singer-songwriter\u2019s new Indie Folk Americana collection, is a testament to her renewal of inspiration, the rekindling of dreams, and the redemptive power and connective compassion that defines her artistry.\n\nHer rich, expressive alto voice frames expansive melodies that echo the American heartland. Now based in Los Angeles, Arielle knows this geography well. A performing itinerary transported her from Club Passim in her adopted hometown of Boston to venues including Eddie\u2019s Attic in Atlanta and Nashville\u2019s 12th & Porter, plus stops to the Southwest, as she steered a vegetable oil-fueled vehicle across Texas to Abilene, Odessa and Austin.\n\nTen years ago, with three well-received releases accompanied by national tours, she lost sight of her future as an artist. \u201cThough my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore,\u201d she recalls.\n\nArielle moved to the City of the Angels. She divorced and remarried, taught yoga philosophy, and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. She penned and published essays and poems, and was nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best New Poets. She baked innumerable pies. After being rejected for a PhD program, she constructed a blue \u201cshe shed\u201d in her backyard. And it was in this rustic space \u2013 surrounded by 47 volumes of her journals \u2013 that she rekindled her love for music and dedicated herself to writing one song per week.\n\nThe result is A Thousand Tiny Torches. Produced by Shane Alexander, the project is propelled by the masterful playing of a sterling cast of players with credits from Lady Gaga to KT Tunstall to Lukas Nelson: Denny Weston Jr., drums; Carl Byron, keyboards; Darby Orr, bass; Jesse Siebenberg, steel guitar; and Mike Mullins on mandolin. Michael Gehring tracked the project at Secret World Studios in Los Angeles in the famous Sound City Studios complex, and GRAMMY-winners Brian Yaskulka and Hans DeKline mixed and mastered, respectively. A loyal group of supporters funded the recording through a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nA consummate storyteller, Arielle\u2019s narratives crosscut exacting details with universal themes. On the lead single \u201cWhat Really Matters,\u201d she recalls a harrowing season in Southern California as gunshots ricocheted through a country bar and the surrounding hills ignited with apocalyptic wildfires.\n\nIn contrast are incandescent songs with characters and conversations etched in fine lines and deep empathy. Vivid imagery glows with headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars that have been shining for ten billion years.\n\nAfter launching her return with a holiday single, Arielle is now back onstage at house concerts and listening rooms, including the fabled Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood. Plans are underway for West Coast tours and upcoming dates in Boston. This time, she says, she is doing it for the right reasons. \u201cWhen I was younger I was performing,\u201d she confirms. \u201cNow, I\u2019m connecting.\"\n\nArielle Silver says that when she made her break with music, her ambition for everything stopped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the future. It was beautiful. I became so present in a way I never had been before, and the sense of being present lasted for a long time.\u201d Now, in themes that speak to losing and rediscovering the path, emerges a musical alchemy of renewal and rebirth: A loving light that is reflected from A Thousand Tiny Torches.", "otherInfo": "Up for Mother's Day (for all those who mother others and really for all of us who are mothered by someone), I'll be the featured artist on WTBQ's Hootenanny Cafe at 9 PM ET / 6 PM PT, broadcast from Warwick, NY at WTBQ 93.5 FM and www.wtbq.com everywhere.\n\nI was asked to curate a set of my new and old singer-songwriter tunes, and DJ Jon Stein will throw in a few of his faves as well.\n\nSpecial love goes out to all the stepmothers in the house!

Oh, and give your music away. Which isn\u2019t to say he won\u2019t be selling his debut full-length offering, Messenger ( Released 2/16/2010 on Lightning Rod). But free is how he came to make it, more or less.\n\nIt worked like this, for Joe Pug anyhow: The day before his senior year as a playwright student at the University of North Carolina, he sat down for a cup of coffee and had the clearest thought of his life: I am profoundly unhappy here. Then came the second clearest.\n\nPug packed up his belongings and pointed his car towards Chicago. Working as a carpenter by day, the 23 year-old Pug spent nights playing the guitar he hadn\u2019t picked up since his teenage years. Using ideas originally slated for a play he was writing called \u201cAustin Fish,\u201d Pug began creating the sublime lyrical arrangements that would become the Nation of Heat EP.\n\nThe songs were recorded fast and fervently at a Chicago studio where a friend snuck him in to late night slots other musicians had canceled. He was short on money, but his bare-boned sincerity didn\u2019t require much more than a microphone and it dripped off of each note he sang.\n\nThe early rumblings of critical praise for the EP were confirmed when his first headlining gig sold out Chicago\u2019s storied Schubas Tavern in 2008. As word spread, Pug struck upon an idea that would later prove to be one of the most significant in his young career. He offered his existing fans unlimited copies of a free 2-song sampler CD to pass along to their friends. He sent the CDs out at his own expense, even covering the postage. Inside each package was a personal note thanking the fan for helping to spread the word. The response was overwhelming, and to date he has sent out over 15,000 CDs to 50 states and 14 different countries. Without access to radio, Pug managed to turn his fans into his very own broadcast system. The offer still stands, and to this day it\u2019s featured prominently on www.joepugmusic.com.\n\n\u201cLook, in the end, I just trust my fans, and the nature of people in general. I need to pay my bills like anyone else does. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to ask someone to pay $15 when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting. So in a way by sending out these CDs, I\u2019m wagering that they\u2019ll like my music, and that if they do they\u2019ll come to shows, buy CDs, and help me spread the word even further. And so far I\u2019ve been proven right. Without question, the more sampler CDs I send out, the more music I sell.\u201d\n\nNation of Heat took on a life of its own, passing from friend to friend and iPod to iPod. The crowds swelled and the media took notice. Tours with Steve Earle, M. Ward, and Josh Ritter followed, as did invitations to Lollapalooza and the Newport Folk Festival. He crisscrossed the country incessantly, traveling mostly alone in his 1995 Plymouth Voyager with no stereo or air conditioning. As the tours went on, he became closely linked to the burgeoning indie-folk scene that was coalescing loosely around Pug and his young contemporaries in bands such as The Low Anthem, Langhorne Slim, and Horse Feathers.\n\nAfter over 200 shows, Pug took a brief respite to record his full-length debut. If Nation of Heat heralded the arrival of a talent to watch, Messenger assigns Pug a deserved spot among the finest songwriters of his generation. From the opening notes of the title track that leads off the record, it\u2019s clear that the artist has no intention of retreating to the comfortable or the familiar. While the scathing war indictment \u201cBury Me Far (From My Uniform)\u201d and the sparse, poetic \u201cUnsophisticated Heart\u201d illustrate that Pug is still a master of the guy-and-guitar song, it\u2019s the supporting cast Pug brought on board that truly brings out the record\u2019s subtle beauty.\n\nFrom the haunting, ethereal pedal steel guitar that sneaks delicately under \u201cThe Sharpest Crown\u201d to the barrelhouse rhythm section that propels \u201cThe Door Is Always Open\u201d, it\u2019s clear that Pug is as comfortable exploring this new territory as he is solo. \u201cThe first record, it was a breeze,\u201d he says. \u201cDidn\u2019t even know we were making it, just me and a guitar\u2026the songs completely unadorned.

During this time, he has also managed to release 4 artist albums and some of the most iconic house music tracks of the last two decades.\n\nMost people know Claude VonStroke for his smiling DJ persona touring every major city, festival, and basement after-party around the world. But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans.

Hailing from the Central Louisiana town of Alexandria, David has steadily built his reputation as an entertainer, playing high energy, musically diverse shows driven by what may be his biggest asset \u2013 that powerful, soul-drenched voice. America got a taste of David\u2019s promising talents when he made the finals of Nashville Star in 2007. Now David is delivering on that promise releasing brand new music showcasing what his followers across the country have been raving about for years.\nDavid\u2019s musical education began early in life as a kid. He was taking in the pop-influenced country sounds of Kenny Rogers from his dad\u2019s record collection before rocking out at Metallica and Guns-n-Roses concerts with his Junior High buddies. The new wave of 90\u2019s country, particularly Garth Brooks\u2019 seminal No Fences album, had a big impact on David. David\u2019s growing obsession for music soon gave way to performing for audiences; he says \u201cI never really wanted to do anything else besides singing and entertaining\u201d. Further musical explorations led David to expand his R&B vocal skills, singing in a Juniorr High group styled after the harmonies of Boyz II Men. By his early 20s David had started playing shows in nearby Hammond, La where he met a local producer. That chance meeting led to a few recording sessions and the beginning of David\u2019s trips to Nashville to take his first swing at the big time.\nIn early 2000, David made further connections in Music City and began working on his first full length album DSR with some of Country Music\u2019s top musicians and songwriters. Over the next few years David toured the country; performing frequently gave David an invaluable opportunity to develop his distinct vocal style and energy-driven live show. \u201cThere\u2019s an experience and wisdom in that environment,\u201d David says, \u201cyou learn to be professional at all times, whether you are playing for two people or a crowd of thousands\u201d.\nOpportunity came knocking in Spring 2007 when he was selected to star as a contestant on the new season of TV\u2019s premiere country competition Nashville Star. Besides the invaluable national exposure the show brought him, David also performed on the 40-city Nashville Star tour and had a chance to interact with many of the nearly half million fans who voted for him. Nashville Star also introduced David to many Music Row veterans, in particular Shawn Pennington, the former manager of mulit-platinum acts Big & Rich, Alabama\u2019s Randy Owen and new group Thompson Square. Shawn was very impressed with what he saw in David\u2019s live show during the Nashville Star tour. \u201cAt the time I was working with Big & Rich and their live show is what really set them apart. They owned the room every night and I\u2019ve seen David do that exact same thing,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cDavid can go into a room where no one knows his songs, and by the end, they are all giving him a standing ovation\u201d.\nBy 2008, David and Shawn were working together finding songs and beginning the process of recording a new album. David also continued collaborating on songs of his own with some of Nashville\u2019s top writers. All I Really Wanted to Say was the first album released on David\u2019s own independent label DSR Entertainment in 2010. His hit single \u201cTwenty Years Late\u201d rocketed to #56 on the Billboard Chart. David continues to successfully tour performing his own brand of country music to riveted crowds earning him a new legion of dedicated fans.\nDavid has also been hard at work writing, producing and recording his newest project due to release later this year. He explains, \u201cI hope this latest EP will show my fans the growth I\u2019ve made as a songwriter and artist, while exploring the depth of my musical influences.

Excelente interprete de rancheras y musica mel\u00f3dica latina.\nComenz\u00f3 interpretando temas con mariachi y m\u00fasica tradicional mexicana. \u00daltimamente canta tambi\u00e9n m\u00fasica pop.\n\nAlejandro Fern\u00e1ndez (born April 24, 1971) is a popular Latin Grammy-winning Mexican singer nicknamed as \"El Potrillo\" (\"The Little Colt\") by the media and his fans. ] Alejandro originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk and country music, such as mariachi and ranchera. However, his more recent work has focused on mainstream pop music. He is the son of Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, also a popular Mexican country singer. His nickname \"El Potrillo\" (The Little Colt) was given to him by the media and his fans because of his being the son of Vicente, who is considered the most popular charro in Mexico.\n\n\nCareer\n\nBorn in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, he trained as an architect but turned to singing in 1991, encouraged by his father. A year later, he released his first album, titled Alejandro Fernandez. Since then, he has recorded 18 albums and sold a reported 15 million records, working with producers such as Emilio Estefan, Jr. and Kike Santander. His first public appearance was in 1976, when his father presented him on one of his shows, he was meant to perform the song \"Alejandra\". In the middle of the song he forgot the lyrics, started crying and suffered a panic attack, but then, his father got on stage and helped him singing along the song, making it a very touching moment between Alejandro and his father.\n\nIn 1992, Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez released his debut, self-titled album, launching one of the most prolific, successful and memorable careers in Latin music. Since then, the son of legendary ranchera singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez has done what few progeny of famous parents have ever been able to achieve: He\u2019s followed in his father\u2019s footsteps, but at the same time, he\u2019s carved out his own, separate path, thanks to his skilled vocals and an unparalleled stage presence. Fern\u00e1ndez also has portrayed the lead role in zapata: El sue\u00f1o del h\u00e9roe, a 2004 movie about the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata by filmmaker Alfonso Arau, which proved to be one of the greatest disappointments in the Nuevo Cine Mexicano era, spending 7 million dollars in production and publicity but faring poorly at the box office.\n\nWhile most Latin acts talk about crossovers from Spanish to English, Alejandro is one of only a handful of artists that have managed to become a superstar by crossing over from the world of traditional ranchera music to the world of pop. That duality began in 1997 with Me Estoy Enamorando, a collaboration with producer Emilio Estefan that sold 3 million copies worldwide and established Alejandro as an international star. In 1998, Alejandro performed along with the operatic tenor Placido Domingo and the French singer Patricia Kaas in Christmas in Vienna VI.\n\nIn 2004, A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto reunites Alejandro with Grammy-winning producer and songwriter Kike Santander, who penned his greatest hits from \"Me Estoy Enamorando\". But it also finds him singing the songs of a bold new generation of songwriters, including Gian Marco, Leonel Garc\u00eda (one half of pop duo Sin Bandera), Reyli Barba (former member of pop band Elefante) and Mexican group Tres De Copas.\n\n\"A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\" is about love, but it\u2019s hardly a staid album. Quite the opposite. Under the guidance of producers Kike Santander and Aureo Baqueiro, the sound of this record is taken beyond the traditional and is an album rich in instrumentation\u2014rippling guitars, flowing strings and mariachi lines\u2014that treads on folk, rock and ranchera elements with organic ease and conviction. The superb emotional and musical interpretations are the clincher. At times exuberant, \"A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\" can also be an album of subtle understatement, unafraid to bare the singer in every sense of the word.\n\n\"Romanticism is something that will never die\", says Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez, explaining his choice of songs on \"A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\", his breakthrough recording about lost love, love that is never forgotten and the capacity to always love again. \"I\u2019m super, ultra passionate. We\u2019re releasing an album that\u2019s an x-ray of myself. That\u2019s why it\u2019s titled \"A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\". It was something very honest. Not naked, but something deeper than that\".\n\nIn 2005, Alejandro launches M\u00e9xico - Madrid: En Directo Y Sin Escalas (in English: Mexico - Madrid: Nonstop). Featuring 13 tracks including one new song, this album is Fern\u00e1ndez at his best - live and in concert! \"Produced by Aureo Baquiero and filmed in front of a live audience at Spain\u2019s Palacio de Congresos IFEMA, the production features Fern\u00e1ndez performing some of his biggest hits accompanied by a 28-piece orchestra and some of Spain\u2019s most important voices on three of the songs: Amaia from La Oreja de Van Gogh joins him on \"Me dediqu\u00e9 a perderte\"; Mal\u00fa duets with him on \"Contigo aprend\u00ed\", and with flamenco star Diego El Cigala perform a moving version of \"Como quien pierde una estrella\", accompanied on cajon by famed Flamenco guitarist Ni\u00f1o Josele. That same year, Alejandro was chosen to sing along with the tenors Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo in a special concerto celebrating the opening of the \"Forum Internacional de las Culturas\" in Monterrey. Alejandro's performance was praised by the audience. He also recorded a duet song with the tenor Mario Frangoulis called \"Hay M\u00e1s\" from the album Follow Your Heart.\n\nIn 2007, launches Viento A Favor features tunes written by Leonel Garc\u00eda and Noel Schajris (better known as emotive Latin-pop duo Sin Bandera) and Mexican singer Reyli Barba. They're all taken to wuthering heights by Fernandez's stellar vocal range, which goes from hushed whispers to booming intensity. First single \"Te Voy A Perder\" is an epic romance, and \"Amor Gitano\", a duet with performer Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles. Closing tune \"Cuando Estamos Juntos\" is another surprise, an acoustic-flavored ode to simple joy.\n\nHe has five children, (Alejandro, Jr. and the twins, Am\u00e9rica and Camila) with his ex-wife, Mexican Am\u00e9rica Guinart, and two (Emiliano and Valentina) with his now ex-girlfriend, Colombian model Ximena D\u00edaz.\n\nDiscography\n\n1992: Alejandro Fernandez\n1993: Piel De Ni\u00f1a\n1994: Grandes Exitos A La Manera De Alejandro Fernandez\n1995: Que Seas Muy Feliz\n1996: Muy Dentro de Mi Coraz\u00f3n\n1997: Me Estoy Enamorando\n1999: Mi Verdad\n1999: Christmas in Vienna VI (Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Patricia Kaas and Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez)\n2000: entre tus brazos\n2001: Or\u00edgenes\n2002: Un Canto De M\u00e9xico\n2003: Ni\u00f1a Amada M\u00eda\n2003: En Vivo: Juntos Por Ultima Vez\n2004: zapata: El sue\u00f1o del h\u00e9roe (Soundtrack)\n2004: A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\n2005: M\u00e9xico - Madrid: En Directo Y Sin Escalas\n2007: Viento A Favor\n2007: 15 A\u00f1os De \u00c9xitos\n\nWebsite :www.alejandrofernandez.com", "otherInfo": "Live from Instagram"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Henry Kapono ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9305364.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Alternative, Hawaiian, World", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Henry Kapono is a performer who has it all \u2013 vocalist, guitarist, songwriter, composer, thrilling performer, audience favorite\u2014and multiple honors and awards, including a Grammy nomination.

They were originally called The Guildford Stranglers and operated from an off-licence in the town. They also based themselves in the nearby village of Chiddingfold for a while.\n\nOriginal personnel were singer/guitarist Hugh Cornwell (from kentish town, london), keyboardist/guitarist Hans Warmling (from Sweden, replaced within two years by brighton-born keyboardist Dave Greenfield), london-born bass guitarist Jean-Jacques Burnel and drummer Jet Black (a.k.a. Brian Duffy), a native of ilford, essex.\n\nThey began as a sinister sounding, hard-edged pub rock group, but eventually branched out to explore other styles of music. The Stranglers were, beginning in 1976, tangentially associated with punk rock, due in part to their opening for Ramones' first British tour. The Stranglers were also associated with new wave music as well as gothic rock, but their idiosyncratic approach never fit completely within a musical genre.\n\nIn August 1990, founding member Cornwell left the band to pursue a solo career. In his autobiography, Cornwell states that he felt the band was a spent force creatively, and cited various examples of his increasingly acrimonious relationship with his fellow band-members, particularly Burnel. The remaining members recruited two replacements, including John Ellis, who had opened for the band in the 1970s as a member of The Vibrators, and singer Paul Roberts.\n\nInterest in The Stranglers resurfaced when, in 2001, singer Tori Amos covered their song \"Strange Little Girl\" and titled the album it was featured on Strange Little Girls. \"Golden Brown\" was also used in the hit film Snatch by film director Guy Ritchie and extensively in the Australian film He Died With A Felafel In His Hand. Their hit \"No More Heroes\" was covered by Violent Femmes and used for the film Mystery Men. \"Peaches\", finally, also appears prominently in another British movie, Sexy Beast by director Jonathan Glazer.\n\nThe Stranglers had a critical and popular renaissance in 2004 (together with their first top 40 hit for 14 years - \"Big Thing Coming\") with the acclaimed Norfolk Coast album and a subsequent sell-out tour. The follow-up album, Suite XVI, was released in September 2006 (the title is a pun on \"Sweet 16\" and also a reference to the fact that it is the band's 16th studio album).", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kysia Live ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368461.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "R&b, Soul, Neo Soul, Motown", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Motown's Blue-Eyed Soul Child now in Chicago and captivating ears everywhere", "otherInfo": "Matt Kysia hosts a live stream morning show that features live performances, special guest interviews and more.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job.

Her songs are slow-release works of craft and catharsis that become treasured, lifetime companions for their listeners. As a storyteller, Colvin is both keen and warm-hearted, leavening even the toughest tales with tenderness, empathy, and a searing sense of humor. In the nearly 30 years since the release of her debut album, Colvin has won three GRAMMY Awards, released twelve albums, written a critically acclaimed memoir, maintained a non-stop national and international touring schedule, appeared on countless television and radio programs, had her songs featured in major motion pictures and created a remarkable canon of work.\n\nColvin was born in Vermillion, South Dakota, where she lived until she was eight. A small-town childhood in the university town of Carbondale, IL. drew her to the guitar by the age of 10. She made her first public appearance on campus at the University of Illinois at age 15. By the late 1970\u2019s Colvin was singing in a Western Swing band in Austin, Texas\u2014the city she now calls home. Moving to New York at the decade\u2019s end she remained in the country music field as a member of the Buddy Miller Band where she met producer, guitarist and co-writer John Leventhal. Leventhal inspired Colvin to find her own voice as a songwriter. She began honing her skill and was soon signed to Columbia Records. Her first album, Steady On, produced by Leventhal, won the GRAMMY Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\nColvin continued to win fans and critics with her subsequent releases, Fat City (1992) and Cover Girl (1994). In 1996, she released A Few Small Repairs (1996), which would prove to be her breakthrough. The song \u201cSunny Came Home\u201d gave Colvin a Top 10 hit, a platinum-selling album and two of GRAMMY\u2019s biggest honors: Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nHoliday Songs And Lullabies (1998), recorded while Colvin was eight months pregnant with her daughter Caledonia, followed. Her next studio album, Whole New You (2001) found Colvin examining new motherhood and the responsibilities of family. These Four Walls (2006) was lauded by People Magazine as \u201cthe most self-assured album of her career\u201d and \u201cone for the ages\u201d by the Washington Post. The Austin-American Statesman called it \u201can exquisite portrait of strength and vulnerability.\u201d\n\nShawn Colvin Live (2009), was recorded during a special three-night engagement at San Francisco\u2019s famous jazz club, Yoshi\u2019s. Live captures the beauty and intimacy of Colvin\u2019s performances, showcasing her inimitable voice and matchless guitar stylings. Praised by both critics and fans, the album was honored with a GRAMMY Award nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\nAll Fall Down (2012) was produced by Colvin\u2019s longtime friend and musical cohort Buddy Miller (Patty Griffin, Robert Plant, Lucinda Williams). Recorded in Nashville with a group of stellar musicians, the album features performances by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Jakob Dylan, Bill Frisell, Viktor Krauss, Brian Blade, Stuart Duncan and Julie Miller.\n\nThe release of All Fall Down was simultaneous with that of her William Morrow/Harper Collins\u2013published memoir, Diamond In The Rough. Diamond in the Rough looks back over a rich lifetime of highs and lows with stunning insight and candor. Through its pages we witness the inspiring story of a woman honing her artistry, finding her voice, and making herself whole.\n\nUncovered (2015) is the long-awaited follow up to fan-favorite Cover Girl. Its twelve tunes include masterful interpretations of songs by Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder, Robbie Robertson and Graham Nash \u2013 and more - but in their selection and delivery they are pure Shawn Colvin.\n\nIn June 2016, Shawn Colvin and longtime friend Steve Earle united to release, Colvin & Earle, their acclaimed self-titled duo album. Produced by Buddy Miller, Colvin & Earle beautifully captures the pair\u2019s extraordinary chemistry and is a true standout in careers already filled with pinnacles and masterpieces. The album received high praise from critics \u2013 NPR asserted that the duo \u201cElevated their collaboration to the level of top-flight album-making, bringing seemingly opposing impulses to the process.\u201d\n\nColvin was recognized for her career accomplishments when she was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Trailblazer Award at the 2016 Americana Honors and Awards Show. Presenting her with this prestigious award was Bonnie Raitt. Said Raitt, \u201cShe\u2019s simply one of the best singers I\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 and a truly gifted and deep songwriter and guitarist\u2026 She was groundbreaking when she emerged and continues to inspire me and the legions of fans and other singer/songwriters coming up in her wake\u201d\n\nTo mark the 20th anniversary of A Few Small Repairs, Columbia/Legacy issued a newly-expanded edition of the album. This special edition includes seven rare live performances culled from the Sony Music archives, plus enhanced artwork including newly-written liner notes by Shawn and producer John Leventhal and recently discovered archival photos.\n\nShawn Colvin\u2019s latest release is The Starlighter (Amazon Music), a new album of songs adapted from the children's music book \"Lullabies and Night Songs.\" The Starlighters\u2019s 14 songs are a mix of traditional numbers and children's standards, an elegant and graceful musical offering that resonates with the warmth and tenderness of poignant familial experience and remembrance. The result is an album that captures the magic and mystery of children's lullabies in a moving and timeless musical offering.", "otherInfo": "My alter ego, Sunny, suggested I start doing a little weekly series and call it \u201cSunny Stays Home\u201d, for obvious reasons.

In the end I feel completely comfortable with it. The less importance you place in any art the more interesting it can become in a way\u2026 I\u2019m making music, I\u2019m going to do some concerts, I need to feed my children.\u201d\n\nMetronomy Forever is the follow-up to 2016\u2019s Summer 08, and contains 17 tracks. Its length is born from a desire for breathing room, from not wanting to stuff the hits together like a bouquet of petrol station roses. In between the sauna-sweat-soaked funk of songs like It\u2019s Automatic, and the beach funeral of Walking In The Dark, lie pretty, glistening ambient tracks. It evokes the feeling of being sat in a nursing home, Swiss-cheese-brained, recalling joyous flashes of a past life while the fugue states of comforting confusion wash over you.\n\nIt also comes from a desire to replicate the feeling of listening to the radio, with sumptuous songs of different types and styles helping lighten your mood, and stifle retches as you inhale scrambled egg steam from the saucepan you\u2019re scrubbing. \u201cThe radio never stops,\u201d as Joe puts it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how emotionally deep the music that comes on is, it\u2019s entirely your situation that gives the music it\u2019s emotional leaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I was concentrating on trying to make these snappy songs, and when they were all sat together it didn\u2019t make for some impressive thing. It wasn\u2019t until I started thinking about the past several years, realising that in that time there\u2019ve been periods of drifting, and looking around for ideas. When I started including these bits of instrumental music and bits of sound, to which I genuinely felt some kind of connection, I put them in amongst these little flowers.\u201d\n\nFlowers are apt metaphor. Mount has moved away from the bustle of his former Parisian home to take up residence atop a hill in the garden of England. It was a necessary change, he says, and one that has soldered a bond with him and nature.\n\n\u201cI think it has everything to do with me at the moment, being in this environment \u2013 and I literally mean the environment. I feel properly more connected with nature. And I\u2019m embracing myself getting into it, because I think it\u2019s a really important part of being a person \u2013 and I haven\u2019t even read that Sapiens book.\u201d\n\nAnd a good thing he hasn\u2019t, as it seems Sapiens has been widely discredited by academics the world over.\n\nMetronomy Forever is a record that exudes a green tranquillity. Mount was concerned that the relative happiness of his existence might stifle his creativity, having no great tragedy to draw from, but discovered the opposite was true.\n\n\u201cTo be jealous of having that stuff going on is a bit dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cI look at successful musicians who, as they get older, struggle to remain relevant. I\u2019m at this point where I feel like, my attitude towards what I do is healthy. With this record I wanted to make a very pure expression of what I\u2019m about right now, and I think for me that makes for better music.\u201d\n\nAnd while the music itself promotes a sense of calm joy, it\u2019s in the lyrics that we remember that even idyllic circumstances require their own maintenance, an oiling of the cogs to keep them crunching along. Mount reminds us of this on Lately, desperately singing \u201cThat is love and it's hard to do, it's a job for two. What do I do if I don't get nothing from you?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the physical space and distance from stress and life on the Rue De Dogshit in the French capital that has had its effect on the creative process. \u202fMount spent much of the last four years working with Robyn on her acclaimed and deeply personal record Honey. 48 months of vicarious agony was exhausting, but ultimately extremely fulfilling.\n\n\u201cIn the space of time since the last Metronomy record I\u2019ve had a very large part in writing an album based on a traumatic experience for her. I knew the whole experience was going to be this massive cathartic thing. When it got to the point of finishing, I remember telling her how good it was and how people are really going to respond to it in the way you want them to. Working with someone and being able to tell someone that is quite an enjoyable thing, being able to know that everything\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a nice feeling to have.\u201d\n\nThose glimmers of emotional, intense, carnal mania seem to have rubbed off on Mount in their own way, too. On Sex Emoji, the subconscious throbbing purple of the erotic digitised aubergine comes to life, a refrain of \u2018love, honey, sex, money\u2019 sang in a coital squeal.\n\nSalted Caramel Ice Cream brings this to the fore too, but more in the vein of Lipps Inc\u2019s Funkytown, and evokes the sapid pleasure and delights of love, but also the panics and anxieties (\u2018Oh god, she\u2019s coming, don\u2019t look up\u2019).\n\nBut when the shagging is over you\u2019re left only with the despair of your sweaty reflection. The moments of pain and sadness on Metronomy Forever are just as real, but also surmountable, much like most of the torture of existence ultimately is. It\u2019s the scope of experience of someone who has decided that agony, while perhaps a good palette from which to scrape your paints, is just not really that much fun. We\u2019re here for a good time, not a long time, and, as Homer Simpson once said, \u201cYou could wake up dead tomorrow.\u201d Get on your hands and knees, plunge your fingers in the soil and scream thanks at the moon for making the waves crash warm foam at the feet of our children.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jesca Hoop ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620149.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Folk, Indie, Alternative, Songwriter, Singer", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "One of five children in a fifth generation Mormon couple, Hoop was steeped in a musical environment created by her family.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Justin Stanton (trumpet and keyboard player in Snarky Puppy) -\nHey everybody!

They\u2019ve opened for such diverse artists as Shakey Graves, Deer Tick, Martin Sexton, and Kaki King. In addition, they\u2019ve been featured on NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition, and the band\u2019s beloved track, \"Cold Canary Gaslight,\" from its 2014 studio debut album, Pray for Rain, has currently surpassed passed one million Spotify listens.\nMarty\u2019s blues epiphany came from a somewhat hilarious turn of events when, as a teenager, he tried to download a hip hop track on Napster, but accidently downloaded Blind Willie Johnson\u2019s \u201cLet Your Light Shine On Me.\u201d It was indeed a fateful mistake. Marty saw an avenue of expression for his teen angst in the simple 3-chord structures and earthy melodies of the blues, and dove headfirst into the tradition.\n\n\u201cI was dealing with a lot of stuff emotionally at the time, and I would sit in my bedroom, play guitar, and listen to old blues for hours. My parents would leave food for me outside my door,\u201d Marty recalls, laughing. \u201cThere was something both angry and calming about that music that resonated with me. That music was my place to get away from all my troubles.\u201d\n\nLater, Marty\u2019s father, a voracious music lover, hipped him to John Fahey\u2019s The Yellow Princess (Vanguard Records, 1968), and that record illuminated the possibilities one could explore with roots music. \u201cI felt like that record had one foot in blues and American folk music, and one foot somewhere else,\u201d Marty explains. That John Fahey record\u2019s lesson would play a part in the evolution of the Old Soul Orchestra from reverent traditionalists to Americana adventurers, as evidenced by Stereoscope.\n\nThe album represents the maturation of artists shedding hero worship and embracing the creativity within. These new frontiers are characterized by a heartfelt purity in Marty\u2019s vocals, the tracks\u2019 unique and richly expressive chord structures and progressions, a shift in narrative perspectives to a more observational bend, and emotionally dynamic arrangements that are beautifully arresting, often beginning with sparse simplicity and then reaching lush and fully orchestrated climaxes with sensitive group interplay.\n\nThe 11-song album opens with \u201cFirmament,\u201d which eases in with delicately eerie ambience and sparse musical accompaniment, revealing all the soulful nuances and inflections in Marty\u2019s voice. The song soars forward with an impactful arrangement as the full band joins in with rich and varied musicality, including a dazzling drum and percussive break and a violin solo as brilliantly fractured as a cubist painting. The album\u2019s third track, the haunting \u201cGhost,\u201d is a swampy ambient blues that uses the phenomena of sleep paralysis as an intriguing metaphor for vulnerability. The standout album single \u201cOff and On Again\u201d offers sweet yearning for a d\u00e9tente after a lover\u2019s quarrel. Other album highlights include a rendition of Skip James\u2019 blues classic \u201cHard Time Killing Floor\u201d with chillingly beautiful new music to accompany the haunting traditional lyrics, and the three stirring, but challenging, instrumentally-driven songs that conclude the album and recall fringe jazz guitarist\u2019s Bill Frisell\u2019s evocations of dustbowl Americana with futuristic ambience.\n\nStereoscope is no doubt a milestone entry for Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra, offering forth the band\u2019s most assured and mature release to date. \u201cWe put our heart and soul into this album,\u201d shares Marty. \u201cIt\u2019s the album I\u2019ve always wanted to make\u2014one that ten years later I can still be proud of. Making it has made me feel whole, and brought me a lot of joy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "In support of The Caledonia, Liverpool.\nDonate now at: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/savethecali"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Barry Kirwan Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9336523.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Easy Listening, Irish Country, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Barry Kirwan was born on the 14th February 1986 with music in the very makeup of his DNA. As the son of Irish singing sensation Dominic Kirwan, it comes as no surprise that Barry had showbiz aspirations from a very early age. Growing up, Barry was a committed member of his school\u2019s choir and devoted much of his time performing in school productions or competing in various solo singing feis\u2019. At the age of 5 he joined the Seamus Kerrigan School of Traditional Irish Dance where he stayed until the age of 18. Here Barry had the amazing opportunity to travel throughout Ireland taking part in a range of competitions, such as the All Ireland Dancing championships and Sc\u00f3r to name a few. A triple threat, Barry can also add acting to his ever increasing list of talents after the years he spent as a member of the Hazel Wand drama school in his hometown of Omagh. No stranger to the stage, Barry was destined to return and seize the spotlight later on in life. At age 11, Barry fell in love with drumming and excelled from grade 1-8 within the space of five years. His passion for the instrument led him to further study in London at Drumtech college, part of the British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) schools. Shortly after college Barry decided to join his father\u2019s band as his drummer and provided backing vocals for over 4 years. Constantly growing as a musician, Barry left Dominic\u2019s band in September 2010 and had the opportunity to live with his brother Colm in Nashville. During his time in the US he stayed with close friends, American country duo Joey & Rory where he had the incredible honour to play drums for 4 of their US shows. As January 2011 came to a close Barry had began to work with Ireland\u2019s princess of country, Lisa McHugh and performed with her until September 2011 before becoming the drummer and backing vocalist for the hit recording artist Derek Ryan. During his 4 and a half years working with the Derek Ryan band, Barry toured all around Ireland, the U.K and Australia. With every show in every city, Barry\u2019s desires became more apparent and in February 2016 he left the Derek Ryan band to pursue his own dream of a solo career in the Irish country music scene. For the past 4 months he has been touring with his father as the support act on the \u2018Here For A Good Time\u2019 tour throughout the UK and Ireland which has proven to be an excellent platform to prepare before his own live shows this summer. On 6th May 2016, Barry released his first solo single \u2018\u2018Keep It In The Middle Of The Road\u2019 from his debut studio album. The song shot to No. 1 spot on the Irish iTunes Country chart and No.2 in the UK iTunes Country chart - a foretelling of the successful career this rising star will undoubtedly have in the years ahead.

After making her Grand Ole Opry debut at the age of 10, the Tennessee-bred virtuoso mandolinist played Carnegie Hall at age 12, then landed a deal with Rounder Records just a year later. Now 28-years-old, Hull is set to deliver her fourth full-length for Rounder: an elegantly inventive and endlessly captivating album called 25 Trips.\n\nRevealing her profound warmth as a storyteller, 25 Trips finds Hull shedding light on the beauty and chaos and sometimes sorrow of growing up and getting older. To that end, the album\u2019s title nods to a particularly momentous year of her life, including her marriage to fellow bluegrass musician Justin Moses and the release of her widely acclaimed album Weighted Mind\u2014a B\u00e9la Fleck-produced effort nominated for Best Folk Album at the 2017 Grammy Awards.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of push-and-pull on this record, where in some moments I feel like everything\u2019s happening so fast and I wish I could slow it all down so I can really enjoy it,\u201d Hull points out. \u201cBut then there are also times where I\u2019m looking forward to the day when the craziness has died down a bit, and life\u2019s a little calmer.\u201d\n\nMade with producer/engineer Shani Gandhi (Kelsea Ballerini, Dierks Bentley, Sarah Jarosz, Alison Krauss), 25 Trips continues the musical journey begun on Weighted Mind, a body of work that built off Hull\u2019s bluegrass roots and ventured into entirely new terrain. But while its predecessor assumed a sparse and stripped-back palette, 25 Trips embodies a far more intricately arranged sound\u2014an effect achieved with the help of peers like guitarist Mike Seal, bassist Ethan Jodziewicz, violinist Alex Hargreaves, and fiddler Christian Sedelmyer, as well as several musicians that Hull has long admired (including bassist Viktor Krauss, guitarist Bryan Sutton, and multi-instrumentalist Stuart Duncan). Along with integrating electric instrumentation and percussion into her material for the first time, Hull dreamed up the album\u2019s eclectic textures by embracing a free-flowing process that often gave way to lightning-in-a-bottle improvisation.\n\n\u201cThere were some songs that we created from the ground up, where I\u2019d go in and play by myself, and from there we\u2019d bring in other musicians to add more and more layers,\u201d Hull says. \u201cIt was really wonderful to work that way, where we started from a place of mystery and then just let the song show us what it wanted or needed to become.\u201d\n\nImmediately proving the power of that approach, 25 Trips lures the listener into its unpredictable sonic world on the beguiling opening track \u201cBeautifully Out of Place.\u201d With its shifting tempos and gently tempestuous mood, the song was sparked from words of encouragement spoken by Hull\u2019s husband at a time of self-doubt and confusion. \u201cI remember Justin saying to me, \u2018I believe in you, so you\u2019re just going to have to learn to believe in yourself,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThat inspired the first line for me, and the song just wrote itself from there.\u201d\n\nAlthough much of the album bears a rich complexity, 25 Trips also includes moments of stark simplicity that perfectly showcase Hull\u2019s stunning vocal range. On \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talking,\u201d for instance, her luminous vocals quietly capture the frustration of finding clarity in the midst of constant chatter from the outside world. And on \u201cCeiling to the Floor\u201d\u2014co-written with Kai Welch, a songwriter/musician known for his work with Glen Campbell and Abigail Washburn\u2014Hull spins a tender metaphor from her longtime fear of heights. \u201cI was telling Kai about how when I was little my dad used to try to get me over that fear by holding me up to the ceiling and saying, \u2018Just touch it\u2014I\u2019m not gonna let you fall,\u2019\u201d she explains. Featuring a performance from legendary steel-guitar player Paul Franklin, \u201cCeiling to the Floor\u201d drifts from memory to real-time reflection, slowly unfolding as a nuanced meditation on courage and love.\n\nOne of the most unexpected turns on 25 Trips, \u201cEscape\u201d emerges as a delicate collage of hypnotic percussion, otherworldly electric-mandolin tones, and poetic yet plainspoken lyrics (e.g., \u201cI want to escape to a world that\u2019s not closing in\u201d). \u201cI didn\u2019t even have that song on my list for the album, but I played Shani a voice memo and right away she said, \u2018I wanna record that,\u2019\u201d remembers Hull, who penned \u201cEscape\u201d with singer/songwriter Angel Snow. \u201cI was a little hesitant since it\u2019s so unlike anything else I\u2019ve done, but in the end it was really exciting to play electric and come up with something in a completely different vein.\u201d\n\nIn closing out 25 Trips, Hull shares an especially poignant track titled \u201cFather Time.\u201d \u201cI wrote that song with Mindy Smith after spending a week with my husband and his grandma, after his grandpa had a stroke on Christmas morning,\u201d she says. \u201cHis grandma had suffered with Alzheimer\u2019s for years and couldn\u2019t really stay by herself, and through that experience I decided to write about watching my husband take such good care of her, and how that made me love him even more.\u201d With its heavy-hearted melody and choir-like harmonies, \u201cFather Time\u201d shows Hull\u2019s effortless finesse in embedding her music with so many subtle details (including an instrumental reference to \u201cJingle Bells\u201d tucked into the second verse). \u201cWe had our instruments with us at Christmas, so at some point we played \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 for my husband\u2019s grandma,\u201d says Hull. \u201cShe can\u2019t remember my name or Justin\u2019s name now, but for some reason \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 stuck, and she still asks for it year-round\u2014it\u2019s the most amazing thing.\u201d\n\nEven as its songs continually shift in genre, encompassing everything from bluegrass to folk-pop to ethereal alt-rock, 25 Trips remains rooted in the sophisticated musicianship that Hull has cultivated almost her entire life. Hailing from the tiny Tennessee hamlet of Byrdstown, she learned to sing from her mother as toddler, took up mandolin just a few years later, and began joining in local bluegrass jams by the young age of eight. With her childhood triumphs including joining her hero and mentor Alison Krauss onstage at the Grand Ole Opry at age 11, she made her Rounder debut with the 2008 album Secrets and promptly garnered the first of many nominations for Mandolin Player of the Year at the International Bluegrass Music Association Awards. In 2016, after a near-decade of consecutive nominations, Hull became the first-ever woman to win the award\u2014then claimed that prize again at the 2017 and 2018 IBMAs. Over the years, Hull has also maintained a rigorous touring schedule, and has made occasional guest appearances with such icons as the Indigo Girls, Garth Brooks, and Gillian Welch.\n\nMarking a bold new era in Hull\u2019s artistic evolution, 25 Trips wholly channels the pure and palpable joy she discovered in the album\u2019s creation\u2014and ultimately illuminates certain truths about the indelible connection between risk-taking and reward. \u201cOne of the things I most enjoyed about making this record was getting to show the wide variety of music I love,\u201d says Hull. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what category the album falls in, but I also think that matters less and less. What really matters to me is trusting myself to be who I am, and just putting my voice and my heart out there in the most sincere way that I possibly can.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Watch Sierra Hull (https://youtu.be/0onWLT1Z8nc) in her 2018 Woods Stage performance for Pickathon #AConcertADay!

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ruthie Collins ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10287414.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Americana, Folk, Country", "Time": "10:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hey you! I\u2019m Ruth\u2026welcome to my little world! I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream. (Dreams are good. I hope you have lots of them:)\nI grew up in rural western NY on a vineyard that\u2019s been in my family for over a hundred years. My grandma was the farmer\u2019s daughter and my grandpa worked on the grapes with her dad. That\u2019s how they met\u2026 Cute huh?\nMusic has been a part of my life since forever. I started playing piano and fiddle when I was three. I sang my first solo at church that year \u2013 and I also wrote my first song titled \u201cMr. Bluebird\u201d \u2013 my mom swears it was the same every time I sang it! Three was clearly a big year for me! But it was middle school when I fell in love with country music. This was 90s country at it\u2019s best \u2013 artists like Garth Brooks, Jo Dee Messina and Faith Hill were killing it on country radio and I couldn\u2019t get enough. I loved the stories they were telling through their songs. In high school it all came together when I started writing and playing the guitar. I was hooked.\nI get asked all the time how a girl from NY could possibly sing country music. Well I have a couple things to say about that: A) They play George Straight in the Wal-Mart where I\u2019m from too and B) My high school mascot was the Fredonia Hillbillies\u2026doesn\u2019t get much more country than that, does it?\nAfter graduating high school I attended Berklee College of Music where I majored in songwriting and made some lifelong friends. I fell in love with Boston (go Red Sox!) but I struggled to find my artistic voice during those years. So with hope in my heart I decided to make the move to Music City.\nWhen I moved to Nashville I started to write with everyone I could. I wrote all the time, sometimes several songs in one day and I was blessed by the support and feedback of so many talented co-writers. Within months, I finally felt like I was writing songs that were me, and through these songs, I found my voice.\nDuring this time I formed the duo Wild Honey, with another local songwriter, Victoria Gibson and we were featured on Season 1 of CMT\u2019s Can You Duet. Being on Can You Duet was the wildest experience. One week I\u2019m waiting tables and the next I\u2019m moving into the Opryland Hotel for a month of filming. Suddenly there were cameras and lights shoved in our faces almost 24 hours a day. The stakes were raised in a big way. The best way I can put it is this\u2026 where I\u2019m from, a tiny little town in NY, I never dared to dream that big\u2026 It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to sing for stadiums of millions of people\u2026 It\u2019s just that I never believed that it could happen to a small town girl like me. But all of a sudden, there I was competing on national television for a major label record deal. Can You Duet gave me the push I needed to realize that dreams do come true\u2026even for normal little people like me.\nAfter Can You Duet, it was on. I worked as hard as I could, writing everyday and back to waiting tables, sometimes till 4 in the morning to make ends meet. All that changed when I signed with Curb Records and Curb Publishing in the summer of 2011. That was a quite the summer! Within 3 months I got married, bought a house and signed a record deal! Whew\u2026 let me tell you, that was a much needed honeymoon:)\nI still live in Nashville, TN, now with my sweet husband and our two tiny dogs (Emmylou and Hazel). And I am so blessed to get to do music everyday. Sometimes when I\u2019m driving down to Music Row in the morning, (that\u2019s where the magic happens here in Nashvegas) I\u2019ll stop for a second and think \u201cI get to hang out my friends today and write a song\u201d???!!!! \u201cLike for my job\u201d???!!! Crazy!\nIt is a crazy life, but it\u2019s mine and I love it! I\u2019m currently recording my first album for Curb Records and it\u2019s SO exciting!!!\nThis record is the result of years of writing songs about the hurts and heartbreaks, joys and blessings, wild rides and sunny days that we all experience. This album represents everything I\u2019ve gone through while chasing down and exploring this wonderful adventure called music. In these songs, I tried to express the emotion we all go through while searching through the storm to find the light, love and home. I hope you love it!:)\nSo that\u2019s my story\u2026 That\u2019s me\u2026 I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sam Hatmaker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9420790.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Pop, Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Heather Pierson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10157682.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Jazz, Folk, Blues", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Heather Pierson is an award-winning pianist, singer/songwriter and performer whose inspiring live performances and growing catalog of releases, both solo and in ensemble, delve into Americana, blues, New Orleans jazz, vocal chants, instrumental piano, and poignant folk.

This band of road warriors have three full length albums under their belt, including their latest release, \"Stay Hopeful,\" which dropped on August 31st, 2018. The new album, \"Stay Hopeful\" debuted at #1 on the iTunes Reggae Charts and at #3 on the Billboard Reggae Charts. The record features some of the biggest and best names in the American Reggae/Rock Scene such as Rebelution, The Movement, Tropidelic, Bumpin Uglies and more. The album was tracked by Jeff Leonard and Eric Rickert at Ocean Industries Studios (Charleston, SC), Jim Georgeson and Clay Miller at Echo Mountain Recording Studio (Asheville, NC) and was mastered by Chris Gehringer of Sterling Sound (New York, NY).\n\nSun-Dried Vibes took home South Carolina's Rock Band of the Year Award in 2012, 2013, and 2016 as voted on by the SC Music Awards and were voted Charlotte NC's Best Local Band 2012 by the Readers of Creative Loafing. On August 28th 2011, SDV released 'Give Thanks' as their debut album and began filling up rooms along the east coast. The group toured relentlessly in support of their debut album and the hard work paid off. On April 8th, 2014 their sophomore album \"Back2Square1\" debuted on the iTunes Reggae Charts at #6 and the hit single \"Young One\" ft. Jeremy Anderson (TreeHouse!) was featured as the MP3 Leak of the Week by The Pier (www.thepier.org). It was then, in 2014, that one of the most progressive promoters in the world took notice and added SDV to the major festival 'California Roots: Carolina Sessions, sharing the bill with the Rebelution, Matisyahu, Collie Buddz, Giant Panda Guerrilla Dub Squad, Katchafire and more in Wilmington, NC. This festival along with a 12 show, headlining tour in the US Virgin Islands was the icing on the cake in 2014.\n\n2015 was the year of opportunity for Sun-Dried Vibes. SDV set out on a national tour that summer highlighted by an appearance at one of the largest reggae music festivals in the world: California Roots Music & Arts Festival, which took place May 2015 in Monterey, CA. The group was humbled to share the bill with SOJA, Steel Pulse, Dirty Heads, Chronixx, The Roots and many more at this festival. 2015 also brought a new opportunity for SDV as the band was added to a world class roster at SEG: Sweetwine Entertainment Group based out of Denver, CO.\n\n2016 shaped up to be the one of the biggest and best yet for Sun-Dried Vibes as they kicked off the year with a SOLD OUT show in their hometown of Charlotte, NC on New Years Eve. The group follows up the sellout with a 20 show national tour in 9 states including a stop at a SOLD OUT One Love Cali Reggae Fest in Santa Ana, CA. The boys also made appearances at Reggae Rise Up Festival in St. Petersburg, FL, a return to the 3rd Annual California Roots: Carolina Sessions on April 9th in Myrtle Beach, SC and the 5th Annual California Roots Music & Arts Festival in Monterey, CA. 2016 also included SOLD OUT SHOWS in 5 other major cities (Washington, DC | Atlanta, GA | Wilmington, NC | Columbia, SC | Austin, TX) and support tours for national touring artists Ballyhoo!, Through the Roots & Zach Deputy.\n\nIn 2017, the group experienced their first major line up change and introduced Jono Cheverez to the family as their new full-time drummer. This did not slow SDV's momentum though, as the band did two national tours supporting Badfish: Sublime Tribute as well as one headlining national tour. The band also founded their own music festival in 2017, Surrounded by the Sound Music & Arts Festival, which was a major success, bringing over 1,000 people together for its inaugural year. To cap off the year, the boys hit the studio and began working on their 3rd full length album, \"Stay Hopeful.\"\n\nIn 2018, the boys kicked things off proper by signing with Empire Booking Agency and hitting the road on another national tour supporting Tomorrow's Bad Seeds. The group experienced their second line up change, as founding bassist Evan Tyler left the group. SDV made the most of this time and added three new members, Tyler Vickery on guitar/vocals, Cliff Bundick on bass and Kody Farris on auxiliary percussion. Now with a more full and powerful sound, the new line up debuted at Surrounded by the Sound Music Festival, creating a new found excitement for both the band and the fans. SDV also dropped their 3rd full length album, \"Stay Hopeful,\" on August 31st, 2018. The album debuted at #1 on the iTunes Reggae Charts and at 3# on the Billboard Reggae Charts. The band is slated to hit the road for another national tour spread across three seperate legs, starting in October, supporting their brand new release.\n\nIt's not a secret that the Sun-Dried Vibes family includes a very loyal fan base, the higher ups have definitely taken notice. SDV has had the pleasure of supporting major acts of all genres including The Dirty Heads, 311, Slightly Stoopid, Ballyhoo, The Movement, Passafire, The Expendables, Badfish: Sublime Tribute, Tomorrows Bad Seeds, Through the Roots, Zach Deputy, The Aggrolites, The Supervillains, Less Than Jake, AWOL Nation, Neon Trees, The Nappy Roots and many more.

Charming. Unstoppable. America first became acquainted with the Country music trio Restless Road while watching Season 3 of The X Factor USA and these are just some of the words that immediately came to their minds. The breakout act didn\u2019t just leave a lasting impression on audiences, but also mesmerized the show\u2019s judges including Simon Cowell and Kelly Rowland. \"X Factor\" of course refers to that undefinable and innate \"something\" that a star simply embodies. And fans and tastemakers recognize that Restless Road has got it times three. Zach Beeken (22), Garrett Nichols (21) and Jared Keim (24) each bring their own \u201cAll- American\u201d experience to a transformed Restless Road. Evident in their self-taught musical skills, these three guys do share one important thing in common above all else: determination. Zach\u2019s very first job was pollinating corn on a farm in Iowa where he discovered his love for Country music and taught himself how to sing. Garrett on the other hand, grew up in Alabama and was involved in everything from school musicals to baseball. One day at age 12 though, he picked up an acoustic guitar and never looked back. Also at a young age, Jared\u2019s community watched in awe as he performed on stage at his local church in Missouri; he found his calling before he could tie his own shoes. Into his teens, Jared trained himself on the guitar, piano and drums. \u201cGetting together to write or record is great because we all grew up with the same hard- working attitude and approach our music in the same way together,\u201d says Zach. It\u2019s this dedication and positive outlook that\u2019s responsible for so much of the group\u2019s success. One of Restless Road\u2019s biggest accomplishments to date is landing at #1 on the iTunes Country Chart. With a Country spin, the group covered one of the most popular songs of 2013, Avicii\u2019s \u201cWake Me Up,\u201d and quickly realized that they had a growing and passionate fan base to satisfy. One of these fans was legendary music manager Johnny Wright. Wright has helped launch Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC and Jonas Brothers (to name a few), so he thoroughly understands what it takes for a group of guys to be successful and began working with Restless Road in 2014. With Wright\u2019s ear for talent and Restless Road\u2019s capability, this Country \u201cman band\u201d (as they refer to themselves) was ready to show the world what they could do and took their live show on the road in 2015. The group has since toured nationwide, secured a coveted performance slot during NASCAR\u2019s AAA Texas 500 Weekend at Texas Motor Speedway in Ft. Worth, brought down the house at Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Draper James fashion line launch party, opened up for songstress Demi Lovato and contributed their talents to an annual Country Music Hall of Fame fundraiser event. Jared sums it up well by explaining, \u201cWe\u2019re three guys who have something to prove.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "\u25aa\ufe0fABOUT THE SERIES\n\"All Dressed Up & Nowhere to Show\" is a virtual concert series presented by SPACE.

Favouring passion over precision, it's easy to see why comparisons to Richie Havens, Ray LaMontagne and Tracy Chapman are common for this soulful troubadour. From humble beginnings in Brampton, Ontario, AHI independently toured over 100,000 miles, through the vast woodlands of Canada and the neon lights of Nashville, to the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and eventually beyond the Atlantic to the brick lanes of London. Along the way, he has recorded with leading acoustic sessions across the UK and Europe, but none has been more viewed than a simple home video of his stunning rendition of Bob Marley\u2019s \u2018No Woman No Cry\u2019, filmed in a London alleyway and accompanied by the sweet harmonies of his three-year-old daughter. The video caught the attention of the Marley family who featured it on the official BobMarley.com website and sent AHI a personalized note from Mrs. Rita Marley herself \u2013 an unparalleled experience for an artist who cites Bob Marley as his greatest musical inspiration. Soon after, AHI returned to find his Indie Soul EP (2014) was chosen one of CBC Radio One\u2019s top 10 records of the year, and he has since been recognized and awarded by Folk Alliance International, Nashville Songwriters Association International, the Songwriters Association of Canada, and the Canada Council for the Arts, among others. For his debut full-length We Made It Through The Wreckage (2017), AHI has collaborated with CMA winning producer Eric Masse (Miranda Lambert) to create what Masse has called an entirely \"new genre\", blending folk, soul and rock, and topping it off with a vocal performance to be expected from a seasoned powerhouse rather than an indie debut. The feel-good single Ol' Sweet Day broke the Billboard Spotify Viral 50 Chart and hit #34 on the U.S. Viral 50 without any promotion or marketing. The track took off on playlists worldwide and surpassed 1 million streams; a rare feat for an artist yet to make his mark. Now a 2017 finalist in the Allan Slaight JUNO Master Class, it\u2019s not hard to see why AHI is one of Canada\u2019s most promising emerging acts.

Sara has previously been featured at Variety, Huffington Post, Yahoo! Music, PopMatters, Magnet Magazine, the homepage of Apple Music, and more. She\u2019s appeared in numerous films and TV shows, including The Wonder Years and Frasier, while her songs have been featured in Grey\u2019s Anatomy and in a national Chevy campaign. Sara has shared the stage with Ben Folds, Juliana Hatfield, Ben Lee, Inara George, Neil Halstead, and Lissie, and provided backing vocals for Moby on The Tonight Show and for The Dandy Warhols and Mojave 3 on KCRW\u2019s Morning Becomes Eclectic.\n\nWild & Precious Life was co-produced by Melson, multi-instrumentalist/guitarist Danny Hechter (Badflower, Jordan McGraw) and Rick Parker (Lord Huron, Joseph Arthur, BRMC, Jeremy & The Harlequins). Hechter brought in bassists Sean Sobash (Dominic Fike) and Nick Diiorio (Jordan McGraw), drummer Jonas Streffer, second guitarist Jake Faun, and violinist Koi Anunta (Jules Galli). Violinist Kerenza Peacock (Adele) also added to the recordings, with additional production and remixing by Eric Breiner of PeachMusicLA.\n\nWritten and performed on piano and guitar, Sara\u2019s songs reflect on hard-won lessons and her tireless journey toward self-acceptance. \u201cIt\u2019s high time I learn to love myself before I\u2019m dead,\u201d she sings in the soulful and heartfelt \u201cComing Out\u201d \u2014 a defiant, weary, and yet serene \u201cI-don\u2019t-give-a-f-ck\u201d anthem for anyone who is ready to shed the mask and step fully into one\u2019s authentic self. \u201cState of Ease,\" written in deep meditation, is a prayer for transcendence \u2014 the quest to maintain a state of equanimity in the face of life\u2019s challenges. \u201cNo one can escape pain, physical or emotional,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we choose to react.\u201d Ethereal and swelling vocals, haunting piano, and swirling guitar lines evoke the bliss of flight, peace and surrender. \u201cSame River\u201d, inspired by the quote from Greek philosopher Heraclitus, No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river, and he's not the same man, is a reminder that the only constant is change -- in the fleeting, morphing moment.\n\nWith classical training at the age of eight, Sara began to gravitate toward the melancholy darkness of Chopin and the fanciful romanticism of Debussy. The daughter of two professors, she grew up in an intellectual Jewish household in a small college town in Indiana. Surrounded by cows and cornfields, her parents\u2019 home was an oasis of culture and worldliness, with books lining the shelves from floor to ceiling, and the best record collection in the neighborhood.\n\nShe graduated from Harvard with an English degree and initially moved out West to become an actor. However, after one too many traumatizing \u201c#MeToo\u201d encounters, Sara went \u201con strike,\u201d as she puts it. \u201cI just refused to go out on any more meetings or auditions. I lived on residuals for a while and spent all day playing guitar and piano, and writing songs. That was when I decided I was going to take that turn from the acting into music. It\u2019s not like that stuff doesn\u2019t exist in the music industry, because it does; but at least you have creative control. You can stand behind a finished product \u2014 your song \u2014 and not have to rely solely on what you look like, or your perceived value, or lack thereof, as a sexual object.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief marriage to Justin Webb, son of famed songwriter Jimmy Webb, the loss of a pregnancy at five months, and an ensuing divorce, Sara struggled with depression, and turned to yoga for salvation, developing a serious daily practice that began to inform her songwriting with new revelations about surrender, acceptance, growth and change. It also slowed her anxious breath to a fluid wave. \u201cYoga is like peeling an onion, gradually removing layers that cover up your true essence. There may be some tears in the process, but it\u2019s delicious, good for you, and worth it.\u201d\n\nThe EP reflects Sara\u2019s spiritual seeking, a deep understanding of her own mortality, and an urgency to make the most of life while she\u2019s here. \u201cWalk Softly\u201d is a plaintive letter of life instructions, penned to herself, invoking the perspective of her older, wiser self advising its younger, more distracted and insecure counterpart: \u201cPlease be gentle, please be kind; you can\u2019t read anybody\u2019s mind. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through. So don\u2019t be quick to your defense, \u2018cause we all hide behind pretense; and it\u2019s got nothing to do with you.\" Title track \u201cWild & Precious Life\u201d inspired by the line in the Mary Oliver poem, The Summer Day (\u201cTell me, What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?\u201d) is a rousing, anthemic call to fulfill one\u2019s full potential, despite the naysayers.\n\nSara will tour in support of the new EP, both solo and with a stripped-down version of her beloved band. She muses that, just as one can never step into the same river twice, her shows take on different forms. \u201cThere is a power in connecting one-on-one with an audience that is its own special magic,\u201d Sara says. \u201cHearing my songs come to life around me with a full band is euphoric. They\u2019re two different experiences, both for me and for the audience, and I live for both.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Beth Bombara ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9052387.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Rock, Americana, Blues", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Beth Bombara has a folk singer\u2019s head and a rocker\u2019s heart.\nDrawing inspiration from the melodies and lyrics of Neko Case and Aimee Mann, along with the hooks and harmonies George Harrison and Tom Petty, she has toured nationally as a headliner and supported shows for Pokey LaFarge, Waxahatchee, and Madisen Ward & the Mama Bear.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What!

When this journey started over 15 years ago, communication was restricted mainly to the stage, written letters and before show meet and greets. Today\u2019s instant social media connection is what helped generate this collection of songs. \u201cI just kept a list of songs that fans would either request via Twitter and Facebook or yell to me on stage,\u201d says LaRue. \u201cUs Time is a very collaborative effort with them. Also, having RS Fields as the producer on this project was a good call. This is our first time working together and he totally nailed the production and we totally were in sync on how it should sound. I am very happy with the end result, it feels live and it feels real, and that is what music is all about,\u201d he continued.\n\nIndependently charged, LaRue has sold over 300,000 records over his career and plays 200-plus shows a year.

We hope that the kinds of conversations we can have as musicians can provide a model for peace that our politicians and citizens find inspiration from.\"\n\nThat inspiration could not be summed up more clearly than on Refuge's gorgeously evocative and powerful first single I Am a Refugee, co-starring Somali poet and multi-media artist Ifrah Mansour, who now makes her home in the Twin Cities. \"I wrote the poem for me, for my community, and for those that are yearning for change, those yearning to deepen their empathy,\" explains Mansour. \"Writing the poem was a way to unleash some pain that I could name finally \u2013 I wrote it because I was so frustrated with so many people sending me emails and asking me what I thought about the travel ban, the first time our American government here shared the first travel ban. And that an artist\u2019s job is to draw that hope, especially in a time of deep hopelessness.\"\n\nLike most of the collaborations on Refuge, I Am a Refugee came to life in the studio, with Sultans of String and their guests composing and creating together. But no matter how they began, they all ended the same: with all the artists recording together at Jukasa, a world-class recording facility on the Six Nations reserve between Toronto and Buffalo.\n\n\"We knew we had to do it this way,\" McKhool stresses. \"We couldn't make an album honouring refugees and do it long-distance. But having everyone in the room at the same time made it extremely challenging, both from a logistical and technical standpoint. But the results certainly made it worthwhile.\"\n\nOf course, Sultans of String have never taken the easy road. Since releasing their debut album Luna in 2007, they have continually strived to make each chart-topping album more original and meaningful than the last. That includes working with an orchestra (2013's Symphony), teaming with Pakistani sitarist Anwar Khurshid (2015's Subcontinental Drift) and even crafting a world-music holiday album (2017's Christmas Caravan), which landed them on the Billboard charts and the New York Times. Their ambition and work ethic have garnered them multiple awards and accolades, including three Juno nominations, first place in the International Songwriting Competition (out of 15,000 entries), three Canadian Folk Music Awards, and countless other honours.\n\nTheir live resum\u00e9 is similarly stellar. Equally at home in a concert hall, jazz club or festival setting, the Sultans have gigged at the legendary club Birdland in New York, the renowned Celtic Connections Festival in the U.K. and the San Jose Jazz Festival. They have performed with symphonies across Canada and the U.S., and played live on BBC TV, Irish National Radio, World Cafe and SiriusXM in Washington. No matter the venue, the goal is the same, McKhool says.\n\n\"I've always wanted our concerts to be a place where everyone feels welcome. I want to reach out to diverse communities to say, 'Come out and enjoy music with us \u2014 you're going to have a really good time.' And it's great to see people from, say, the South Asian community mixed in with the hipster crowd. Or to play some very small towns where they might not have heard a sitar played live before.

You did? Boy oh boy.\n\nThe metronome reference was but a musical in-joke before: now it contains more meaning. The steady tick-tocking of the pendulum represents continuation, stability, endlessness, and consistent familiarity. It understands that while we all ultimately return to the goo from whence we came, time marches on furiously, like a bull aiming for a matador. Your last breath will be another click on the machine.\n\nMetronomy Forever in name represents a similar ethos: something looking backwards and forwards simultaneously, like Janus, something fated and eternal. You were made from dust and to dust you will return, that sort of thing.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is when you\u2019re making music and you enter a world where you have achieved some sort of celebrity no matter how large or small you start to think about yourself in terms of legacy and what you\u2019re going to leave behind,\u201d says Mount. \u201cAnd then you realise that\u2019s limited to the interest people have in you. In the end I feel completely comfortable with it. The less importance you place in any art the more interesting it can become in a way\u2026 I\u2019m making music, I\u2019m going to do some concerts, I need to feed my children.\u201d\n\nMetronomy Forever is the follow-up to 2016\u2019s Summer 08, and contains 17 tracks. Its length is born from a desire for breathing room, from not wanting to stuff the hits together like a bouquet of petrol station roses. In between the sauna-sweat-soaked funk of songs like It\u2019s Automatic, and the beach funeral of Walking In The Dark, lie pretty, glistening ambient tracks. It evokes the feeling of being sat in a nursing home, Swiss-cheese-brained, recalling joyous flashes of a past life while the fugue states of comforting confusion wash over you.\n\nIt also comes from a desire to replicate the feeling of listening to the radio, with sumptuous songs of different types and styles helping lighten your mood, and stifle retches as you inhale scrambled egg steam from the saucepan you\u2019re scrubbing. \u201cThe radio never stops,\u201d as Joe puts it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how emotionally deep the music that comes on is, it\u2019s entirely your situation that gives the music it\u2019s emotional leaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I was concentrating on trying to make these snappy songs, and when they were all sat together it didn\u2019t make for some impressive thing. It wasn\u2019t until I started thinking about the past several years, realising that in that time there\u2019ve been periods of drifting, and looking around for ideas. When I started including these bits of instrumental music and bits of sound, to which I genuinely felt some kind of connection, I put them in amongst these little flowers.\u201d\n\nFlowers are apt metaphor. Mount has moved away from the bustle of his former Parisian home to take up residence atop a hill in the garden of England. It was a necessary change, he says, and one that has soldered a bond with him and nature.\n\n\u201cI think it has everything to do with me at the moment, being in this environment \u2013 and I literally mean the environment. I feel properly more connected with nature. And I\u2019m embracing myself getting into it, because I think it\u2019s a really important part of being a person \u2013 and I haven\u2019t even read that Sapiens book.\u201d\n\nAnd a good thing he hasn\u2019t, as it seems Sapiens has been widely discredited by academics the world over.\n\nMetronomy Forever is a record that exudes a green tranquillity. Mount was concerned that the relative happiness of his existence might stifle his creativity, having no great tragedy to draw from, but discovered the opposite was true.\n\n\u201cTo be jealous of having that stuff going on is a bit dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cI look at successful musicians who, as they get older, struggle to remain relevant. I\u2019m at this point where I feel like, my attitude towards what I do is healthy. With this record I wanted to make a very pure expression of what I\u2019m about right now, and I think for me that makes for better music.\u201d\n\nAnd while the music itself promotes a sense of calm joy, it\u2019s in the lyrics that we remember that even idyllic circumstances require their own maintenance, an oiling of the cogs to keep them crunching along. Mount reminds us of this on Lately, desperately singing \u201cThat is love and it's hard to do, it's a job for two. What do I do if I don't get nothing from you?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the physical space and distance from stress and life on the Rue De Dogshit in the French capital that has had its effect on the creative process. \u202fMount spent much of the last four years working with Robyn on her acclaimed and deeply personal record Honey. 48 months of vicarious agony was exhausting, but ultimately extremely fulfilling.\n\n\u201cIn the space of time since the last Metronomy record I\u2019ve had a very large part in writing an album based on a traumatic experience for her. I knew the whole experience was going to be this massive cathartic thing. When it got to the point of finishing, I remember telling her how good it was and how people are really going to respond to it in the way you want them to. Working with someone and being able to tell someone that is quite an enjoyable thing, being able to know that everything\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a nice feeling to have.\u201d\n\nThose glimmers of emotional, intense, carnal mania seem to have rubbed off on Mount in their own way, too. On Sex Emoji, the subconscious throbbing purple of the erotic digitised aubergine comes to life, a refrain of \u2018love, honey, sex, money\u2019 sang in a coital squeal.\n\nSalted Caramel Ice Cream brings this to the fore too, but more in the vein of Lipps Inc\u2019s Funkytown, and evokes the sapid pleasure and delights of love, but also the panics and anxieties (\u2018Oh god, she\u2019s coming, don\u2019t look up\u2019).\n\nBut when the shagging is over you\u2019re left only with the despair of your sweaty reflection. The moments of pain and sadness on Metronomy Forever are just as real, but also surmountable, much like most of the torture of existence ultimately is. It\u2019s the scope of experience of someone who has decided that agony, while perhaps a good palette from which to scrape your paints, is just not really that much fun. We\u2019re here for a good time, not a long time, and, as Homer Simpson once said, \u201cYou could wake up dead tomorrow.\u201d Get on your hands and knees, plunge your fingers in the soil and scream thanks at the moon for making the waves crash warm foam at the feet of our children.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chad Cooke Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8919274.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Kevin Pool - Bass, Chad Cooke - Lead Vocals Acoustic Guitar, Mike Neyra - Drums, Dallas McGillberry- Lead Guitar", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Four country crooners from Houston are paving their way in the Texas country music scene.

As he prepares the release of Us Time, LaRue reflects on this important connection he has fostered with his fans over his 15-plus years of touring. Together, LaRue and his fans have culled together a \u201cfavorite live song set\u201d that is dedicated to his loyal and growing fan base. LaRue is known for his real life, thinking man\u2019s music.\n\nUS TIME is a collection of songs from the native Texan who now resides in Oklahoma reflecting on his own dreams that openly shares with his longtime fans. \u201cThis project is a tribute to my fans. We have developed a strong relationship and I appreciate all of them,\u201d says LaRue. \u201c Together, we have built a compilation of fan favorites from the live shows that reflect the complexion of our time together in music, it is simply our US Time, \u201c he continues. This sentiment rings even louderafter LaRue took a hiatus from touring this summer to re-center his life that seemed to be lost.\n\nLaRue says, \u201cBeing able to record such timeless songs as \u201cEmpty Glass,\u201d \u201cInto the Mystic\u201d and \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d aside some of original tunes, all selected by my fans make me feel validated as an artist and hopefully it gives the fans exactly what they are looking for.\u201d\n\nBeing able to connect with fans the way we can today is mind blowing to LaRue. When this journey started over 15 years ago, communication was restricted mainly to the stage, written letters and before show meet and greets. Today\u2019s instant social media connection is what helped generate this collection of songs. \u201cI just kept a list of songs that fans would either request via Twitter and Facebook or yell to me on stage,\u201d says LaRue. \u201cUs Time is a very collaborative effort with them. Also, having RS Fields as the producer on this project was a good call. This is our first time working together and he totally nailed the production and we totally were in sync on how it should sound. I am very happy with the end result, it feels live and it feels real, and that is what music is all about,\u201d he continued.\n\nIndependently charged, LaRue has sold over 300,000 records over his career and plays 200-plus shows a year. His songs have seen the top of the charts, most recently his hit \u201cGolden Shackles\u201d from his eOne Music debut, Aviator, in 2014.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Paxton Rutherford ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353202.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AG Weinberger ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6730898.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "R&b/soul, Crossover, Rock, Blues, Jazz, Soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "https://www.agweinberger.trollnoodle.com/bio", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anthony Green ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7606873.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Folk, Indie, Alternative, Rock, Acoustic", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Anthony is currently the lead vocalist for the band Circa Survive, and recently released his solo album entitled \"Avalon\" on August 5th, 2008.\nHe is also the ex-lead vocalist for the band Saosin.

Other past and present side projects and bands include, High and Driving, Audience of One, Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer and Jeer At Rome.\n\n\nOn an interesting side note, the William J.

Saosin would release only one EP, entitled Translating The Name, with Green in the lineup before his departure.\n\nAnthony left Saosin in early 2004 to form Circa Survive, the band immediately gained the support of Equal Vision Records and within a year had released a limited edition tour EP entitled The Inuit Sessions. Anthony Green considers Circa Survive his only band, and has labeled his other ventures as \"projects,\" these include The Sound Of Animals Fighting and his solo career.\n\nCirca Survive has embarked on many national tours, with bands such as Mae, Saves the Day, Cute Is What We Aim For, among other artists.\n\nAnthony Green has recently started to launch his solo career.

In more ways than one.\n\n\"We love to expose people to sounds they might not have heard before,\" explains violinist and bandleader Chris McKhool, summarizing the mission statement of the ground-breaking and acclaimed world music ensemble. \"And we love collaborating with other artists.\"\n\nOver the past dozen years and six albums, McKhool and his bandmates \u2014 co-founding guitarist Kevin Lalibert\u00e9, bassist Drew Birston, Cuban percussionist Rosendo \u2018Chendy\u2019 Leon and second guitarist Eddie Paton \u2014 have excelled at both. Thrilling listeners around North America with their genre-hopping fusion of Celtic reels, flamenco, Gypsy jazz, Arabic, Cuban, and South Asian rhythms, Sultans of String celebrate diversity and creativity with warmth and virtuosity. And they often do it with artists such as Paddy Moloney and The Chieftains, Richard Bona, Benoit Bourque (Bottine Souriante), Nikki Yanofsky, Alex Cuba, Ruben Blades, Crystal Shawanda and Ken Whiteley.\n\nWith their historic and visionary seventh album Refuge (coming in 2020), McKhool and co. bring their unique brand of musical synergy and collaboration into the studio like never before. Their most ambitious, diverse, inclusive and passionately political album, Refuge puts the Toronto-based Sultans face-to-face with a VIP roster of artists from around the globe \u2014 including American banjo master Bela Fleck, Israeli vocalist Yasmin Levy and others, like Iraqi violinist Imah Al Taha and Iranian santur master Amir Amiri, who have fled the peril and persecution of their homelands for the safer shores of North America.\n\n\"This is a project that is centred around the positive contributions of refugees and new immigrants to U.S.A. and Canada,\" says McKhool, whose Lebanese grandfather stowed away on a ship bound for North America a century ago. \"We are bringing in special guests that are newcomers to this land, as well as global talents that have been ambassadors for peace. We wish to celebrate the successes of those who make the journey here, and bring their extraordinary talents with them. We hope that the kinds of conversations we can have as musicians can provide a model for peace that our politicians and citizens find inspiration from.\"\n\nThat inspiration could not be summed up more clearly than on Refuge's gorgeously evocative and powerful first single I Am a Refugee, co-starring Somali poet and multi-media artist Ifrah Mansour, who now makes her home in the Twin Cities. \"I wrote the poem for me, for my community, and for those that are yearning for change, those yearning to deepen their empathy,\" explains Mansour. \"Writing the poem was a way to unleash some pain that I could name finally \u2013 I wrote it because I was so frustrated with so many people sending me emails and asking me what I thought about the travel ban, the first time our American government here shared the first travel ban. And that an artist\u2019s job is to draw that hope, especially in a time of deep hopelessness.\"\n\nLike most of the collaborations on Refuge, I Am a Refugee came to life in the studio, with Sultans of String and their guests composing and creating together. But no matter how they began, they all ended the same: with all the artists recording together at Jukasa, a world-class recording facility on the Six Nations reserve between Toronto and Buffalo.\n\n\"We knew we had to do it this way,\" McKhool stresses. \"We couldn't make an album honouring refugees and do it long-distance. But having everyone in the room at the same time made it extremely challenging, both from a logistical and technical standpoint. But the results certainly made it worthwhile.\"\n\nOf course, Sultans of String have never taken the easy road. Since releasing their debut album Luna in 2007, they have continually strived to make each chart-topping album more original and meaningful than the last. That includes working with an orchestra (2013's Symphony), teaming with Pakistani sitarist Anwar Khurshid (2015's Subcontinental Drift) and even crafting a world-music holiday album (2017's Christmas Caravan), which landed them on the Billboard charts and the New York Times. Their ambition and work ethic have garnered them multiple awards and accolades, including three Juno nominations, first place in the International Songwriting Competition (out of 15,000 entries), three Canadian Folk Music Awards, and countless other honours.\n\nTheir live resum\u00e9 is similarly stellar. Equally at home in a concert hall, jazz club or festival setting, the Sultans have gigged at the legendary club Birdland in New York, the renowned Celtic Connections Festival in the U.K. and the San Jose Jazz Festival. They have performed with symphonies across Canada and the U.S., and played live on BBC TV, Irish National Radio, World Cafe and SiriusXM in Washington. No matter the venue, the goal is the same, McKhool says.\n\n\"I've always wanted our concerts to be a place where everyone feels welcome. I want to reach out to diverse communities to say, 'Come out and enjoy music with us \u2014 you're going to have a really good time.' And it's great to see people from, say, the South Asian community mixed in with the hipster crowd. Or to play some very small towns where they might not have heard a sitar played live before. It benefits society as a whole, to have people from around the world blending their ideas, mixing their cultures.\"\n\nAnd sharing the wealth.", "otherInfo": "https://www.facebook.com/cdnmusician\nChris McKhool live stream interview with Canadian Music Magazine\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Andrew King, featuring slides, video clips from our new project, and stories about how this exceptional album came to be. \u201cRefuge is a fantastic, moving, dreamlike, epic, timely album.\u201d \u2013 Ken Micallef (Jazz Times, Stereophile, Downbeat)"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sam Buckingham ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8974078.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Folk, Pop", "Time": "10:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWinsome songs delivered with empathic delicacy\u201d - Rolling Stone\n\n\"Gorgeous and moving... with an authenticity that is undeniable\" - The Au Review\n\nAfter an impressive 18 months since releasing her acclaimed album \u201cThe Water\u201d singer-songwriter sweetheart Sam Buckingham hits the road, touring for the first time with her band, bringing the album to life and premiering a swag of gorgeous new songs.\n\nRecorded over just one week in a converted horse stable on the NSW south coast, \u201cThe Water\u201d has seen Buckingham tour alongside Kasey Chambers, James Reyne, Jordie Lane and Diesel, showcase at Nashville\u2019s renowned \u201cAmericanafest\" and embark on three national sellout tours of her own.\n\nAn audio journal of sorts, Buckingham penned the majority of the album while living in Latin America.

Caitlyn Smith, one of Nashville's most prized writers, is one of them: and, after years spent composing songs for and with everyone from Dolly Parton to Garth Brooks to Meghan Trainor, she's finally ready to unveil all sides of her enormous talent with Starfire. Long lauded for her ability to whirl pure emotion into unforgettable tracks, Starfire is a raw, visceral journey about love, hardship and the struggle to pave your own way, all anchored by her unforgettable tone. A few minutes of listening and one thing becomes abundantly clear: there is no one better to sing the music of Caitlyn Smith than Smith herself.\n\n\"I wanted to unlock my heart and dig around inside a little,\" Smith says about the songs of Starfire, with the first five songs available now. \"And I wanted to be more vulnerable, and tell the stories I have lived. It's more of a raw process to write for myself.\"\n\nIndeed, songs like \"Before You Called Me Baby\" shake the listener to the core: blending her soulful vocals with stirring, deeply honest lyrics and instrumentation that only amplifies the organic construction, they occupy a unique space that can both blossom with a full band or be stripped down into intimate, solo experiences. Because Smith, who has toured and opened for acts such as Eric Church, Sheryl Crow and Dierks Bentley, understands not only how important the craft itself is, but also how music can \u2013 and should - transform in a live setting. With just her acoustic guitar, Smith can stun to silence.\n\nRaised in the small town of Cannon Falls, Minnesota, Smith grew up singing in the church and at county fairs \u2013 and it soon became abundantly clear that her talent stretched well beyond the ordinary. She wrote her first songs at the young age of eight, and had already convinced her parents that a career as an artist was her true path by the time she reached her teenage years. \"I released two records before I graduated high school,\" Smith recalls. \"I knew I needed to do music and nothing else.\" After a stint in Minneapolis, it was clear that Nashville was where she belonged, and she quickly became a sought-after force in the songwriting scene: so much so that even music she intended to sing herself quickly got snatched up by others, yielding her two top country hits, including the platinum \"Wasting All These Tears,\" recorded by Cassadee Pope.\n\nA celebrated force in the writer's room, Smith's also had her songs cut by Parton, Brooks and Lady Antebellum, and co-wrote Trainor's John Legend duet, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" among many others. For a while, Smith balanced her two worlds \u2013 as an artist, and a writer \u2013 while primarily focusing on the latter, working to perfect her craft and discover exactly what she wanted to say in her solo work. She released some music under her own name, but it didn't capture the spirit she ultimately wanted. \"I was shooting for something instead of singing music that was in my heart, that I loved,\" she says, as honest as ever. \"So I stepped back. I said to myself, 'the next thing that I release, I don't want to ask anybody's opinion. I want to go into the studio and make a record that I love and is true to me.'\"\n\nThat next thing became Starfire, produced by Paul Moak, who quickly became Smith's trusted collaborator. They would often bunker down at his Nashville studio, while Smith enlisted friends and colleagues for co-writes, like Gordie Sampson, Kate York and Sarah Buxton. But suddenly, some news came along: Smith was expecting a child. \"It added a beautiful layer of excitement,\" she says. \"Not only was I making a record, but I'm making a life. This little boy has been along for the ride.\"\n\nStarfire, itself, is all about growth, and what it takes to get to your most honest and true incarnation. Smith decided to trust her strengths: her soulful vocals, her strong sense of imaginative storytelling and her ability to craft melodies that exist outside of genre walls and instead focus on timelessness. But there are plenty of infectious hooks in there, too.\n\n\"We didn't want to think about genre or radio or any boundaries,\" she says. Like Chris Stapleton, Maren Morris or even Crow, she artfully blends a steady catalogue of influences and reference points, held together by stellar craft and her formidable voice. \"We wanted to make music that moved us, stay out of the way of the songs and let my voice shine through. Some songs sound more country, some sound more folk. There's a little rock and soul in there, too, which makes it a bit of a genre-less record. But it feels just right to me.\"\n\nGenreless, maybe, but full of vitality, and also downright honest. Take a song like \"This Town is Killing Me,\" about how life as an artist in Music City isn\u2019t all champagne and roses, even when there are small successes. \"It can be a such a hard, heartbreak town,\" Smith says. \"As much as you want to write those songs you know would pay the bills, if you did it every day, the artist part in you would die. There is this balance of loving this town because you get to create, but also it is just so brutal.\" Smith isn\u2019t the kind to smile and nod \u2013 instead, she turns her emotions into moments like this that manage to be about both her own experience and the human condition as a whole.\n\nAnd then there are songs like \"Tacoma,\" devastating in both its lyrics and its sheer beauty: \"I'm burning your memory one mile at a time\" Smith sings in her stunning vocal delivery to stripped-down production. Then, of course, there is the title track, which blends a pop groove with a soulful, chugging chorus. It's about how important it is to keep going even when the world wants to bring you down \u2013 an attitude that has ruled Smith's career thus far. Here, she proclaims her strength to a dynamite beat: it's one thing to have the talent to be a star, but it's another to have the will to keep your fire flaming bright.\n\n\"This whole record and process, I've been on a journey,\" she says. \u201cI've heard no many times and just kept going. I've learned that one thing is for certain: nothing is going to burn me out.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/caitlynsmith"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Peter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6342988.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "1.)

She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others.\n\nTuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz.\n\nIn 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day.\n\nIn 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan.\n\nThat's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brandon Ross ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Alpine Camp ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10231483.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Jamgrass, Jam Bands", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "You don\u2019t often picture the wilderness when you think of LA.

It also has the media capitol of the world sitting right there in the middle. This Southern Californian duality runs deep in the Los Angeles bred band The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe band is comprised of bass, drums, guitar, piano, pedal steel and banjo. The Alpine Camp could hang with the bluegrass crowd if it wasn\u2019t for the drummer. You could also expect Gram Parsons to waltz through the door since they can chicken pick with the best. But, at its core, the group is an Americana Roots Rock outfit with pop sensibilities.

Bell had traveled to Nashville and fallen back in love with country, bluegrass and songwriting in general.

From there, what started as a one off project, blossomed to include some of the most deft players in Southern California. The musicians who added their signature sounds to those initial recordings have since become permanent and integral members of what is now The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe Alpine Camp has spread their mountain tinged roots rock far and wide since 2014. Since then they have performed at Earth Jam, the California Oysterfest, OC Music Fest and shared the stage with Atlas Genius, The Brothers Comatose, Midnight North, The Motet and Ghost Light amongst many others.\n\nThe Alpine Camp seems to think traditional roots instrumentation and exploratory rock can coexist and so do their fans.

At least a little. To sneak a peek, catch a glimpse, get a taste of something exciting. Kacy Hill certainly does, and with Like A Woman, she\u2019s inviting her fans to do the same. The album is an experiment in sexuality, an immersive sex positive experience, in which Kacy takes listeners into her mind and her world. To create this world, Hill has developed a unique visual and auditory story, toeing the line between titillation and tenderness, playing with the boundaries of what it means to be a sexually awakened woman in 2017.\n\n\u201cSexuality is a part of my life that I have avoided,\u201d Hill says, citing her discomfort with the attention she received after the release of her breakout single \u201cArm\u2019s Length,\u201d when some images of her modeling for American Apparel surfaced online. At the time they were shot, these images were \u201cfun, and freeing, and like something I had ownership of,\u201d she says. Once they were a topic of conversation, however, she felt that the narrative was being taken out of her hands, and turned into something scandalous. So, she did what any new artist would to: she went to her mentor, Kanye West.\n\nWest\u2019s advice caused Hill to make some serious changes in her sound and her story as an artist. She began focusing more on her voice, letting the melody lead the track, and writing from the parts of her heart that she had previously kept close. The album is about sex, but it\u2019s also about intimacy, longing, heartbreak, and exploration. Where Hill had previously been relying on catchy hooks and production to tell her stories, now she\u2019s relying on her deepest longing, desire, and curiosity to inform the tracks.\n\nThe first two singles, \u201cHard to Love\u201d and the title track, \u201cLike A Woman\u201d introduce listeners to this new Kacy Hill. On \u201cHard to Love\u201d Hill\u2019s voice is front and center, tender and pleading with the listener, to remember their own heartbreaks, but not to let them defeat them. A radio ready pop track, \u201cHard to Love\u201d is a sweet song about sadness, touching on the tender side of sexuality. Meanwhile, \u201cLike a Woman\u201d is a passionate, slow burning song, that builds slowly before opening up to give Hill\u2019s voice room to breathe.

It is released in an elegant digipack, with photography by Sarah-Johanna Eick. \"Almost Forgotten Tales\" is a concept album in which 10 pieces of music are interwoven with each another, conjuring up a world of images. It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it. This is not a new idea. But nobody has captured the essence of it like Thomas.\" so Nitze.", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joe Russo's Almost Dead ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365723.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Joe Russo's Almost Dead is Scott Metzger, Tommy Hamilton, Dave Dreiwitz, Marco Benevento & Joe Russo.

Relentlessly touring as a headliner \u2013 his attitude is, \u201cWhen you love what you do, you can work all the time,\u201d \u2013 he has also shared the stage with luminaries such as Emmylou Harris, Richard Thompson, Ani diFranco, Indigo Girls, and Greg Brown, and has attracted an audience that stretches from Anchorage to Amsterdam.\n\nPeter Mulvey began as a self-described \u201ccity kid\u201d from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He played, wrote, and sang in bands while studying theatre there, and then traveled to Dublin, Ireland, in 1989, where he learned the trade of the street singer. Returning to the States, he relocated to Boston and began making a living as a subway and street busker, as well as releasing the first few of many CDs. Within a couple years he took to the road full time.\n\nThe road years further seasoned his abilities as a performer. Whether playing solo or with a band in tow, Mulvey has a rare ability to hold an audience\u2019s attention and transport them, using wit, humor, and a subtle but sophisticated melodic and harmonic sensibility to gracefully introduce complex and provocative concepts and characters.\n\nHighlight recordings over the years include 1995's \"Rapture\", \"The Trouble With Poets\" (produced by David Goodrich in 2000), 2004's \"Kitchen Radio\", the fan favorite \"Notes from Elsewhere\" (entirely solo versions of his songs) and recently, his collaborations with Chuck Prophet (\"Silver Ladder\"), Ani DiFranco (\"Are You Listening?\"), and Todd Sickafoose (\"There Is Another World\").\n\nCollaboration is another source for Peter\u2019s continued growth. In 2003, he released the trio album, Redbird, with fellow songwriters Kris Delmhorst and Jeffrey Foucault. The album\u2019s 17 songs range from jazz standards to old country tunes to contemporary covers, all recorded in three days around one microphone. Peter\u2019s annual hometown holiday in-the-round gigs have become an institution over nearly a decade. He can sit in with nearly any musician or ensemble and improvise in the common language of music.\n\nAs a complement to his touring and recording, Peter has also kept a hand in education; teaching guitar and songwriting workshops across the country. His songs and deep baritone voice have been heard in documentary films, major television shows, and by dance and theater companies. His longstanding gig at the National Youth Science Camp gave rise to an illustrated book, \"Vlad the Astrophysicist\".\n\nFor over ten years Peter has done an annual Fall tour entirely by bicycle, partly for environmental reasons and partly for the sheer fun of continuing his creative, unorthodox approach to a long and fruitful career as an artist.\n\nIn every aspect of his career, Mulvey draws on an extremely broad swath of influence; he is always reading, listening, and eager to hear new poetry, modern minimalist composers, old-time fiddle tunes, Argentinean trip-hop, or top-shelf bar bands. Said The Irish Times: \u201cPeter Mulvey is consistently the most original and dynamic of the US singer-songwriters to tour these shores. A phenomenal performer with huge energy, a quick fire, quirky take on life, and an extraordinary guitar style. A joy to see.\u201d\n\nStill, it is the live performance that defines that work. Night after night, whether performing solo, duo (with David \u201cGoody\u201d Goodrich), or sometimes even with a band, Mulvey attempts to be the sum of his parts, to draw on all the musical legacies he has studied, to make a fresh, vital moment out of everything he and the audience have brought to the table that night. \u201cPeople need this. I need this. To come together in a room, to try to make music come alive, for real, for right now, and then to let it go\u2026that is the whole deal for me.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.signaturesounds.com/homesessions"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tuk Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10071157.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/tuksmithofficial"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Todd Michael Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9796811.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country Music", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Established in late 2017, the Todd Michael Band is a band of high caliber and all-star country musicians. The band was formed as a vision of Todd Michael, a singer/songwriter from Michigan, to be a regional powerhouse and to spread their passion and joy of music to all who attend their shows.\n\nTodd Michael \u2013 Lead Vocals - the golden voice and Country front man out of the Great Lakes Bay Region of Michigan, has been nominated for Country Male Vocalist of the Year by Review Magazine in 2016 and again in 2017. Todd found a love for music very early on and has been singing since he can remember. \"My first solo performance was at 6 years old in church for Father's Day. I sang \"Love With Out End, Amen\" by George Strait. Country music is in my blood and nothing more I love than to be on stage and entertaining.\" Todd continued to grow his passion for singing at Reese High School and as he attended Saginaw Valley State University. In 2008, Todd won the Soaring Eagle Casino Idol Contest. Since then, Todd has performed with many great musicians as lead vocalist for Michigan cover bands Detroit Dixie, Kickin\u2019 Dust, and Taylor Tucky.

He has showcased his talents on many recordings over the years with some of them earning airplay on local radio stations. Rob notes, \u201cI grew up on KISS, Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, and all the 70\u2019s rock and roll. If you have told me 15 years ago that I would be playing country music, I would have laughed. This new generation of country is a lot more rock than it was 10 years ago. There are a lot of great guitar players in the country music scene!\u201d Rob\u2019s guitar playing has that edge that the new generation of country demands, plus he still has that country \u201ctwang\u201d in his back pocket when he needs it. He is a great showman with great stage presence which makes him a great asset to the Todd Michael Band.\n\nBruce Shew - Bass/Vocals - Bruce is a 4th generation musician and has over 20 years of playing bass professionally. Bruce not only plays the bass extremely well, but he also has great vocal ability to sing both lead and harmnoy.

He plays bass, guitar, piano, and even the ukulele. Pete brings professionalism to all areas including assisting with some of the arrangements and production.\nBorn into a family of talented musicians, it is no surprise how quickly his passion for music and precision developed. He began studying piano at age 5. With growing interest this was followed by singing and playing in his church\u2019s praise band, he has also been a member of such groups as Kari Holmes, Five Rows Back and The Stand Strength Team. He started his own group, BIC, where he wrote and recorded music, played bass and sang lead.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hayes Carll ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6177605.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country, Singer, Alternative Country, Songwriter", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The chorus to the title track on the new Hayes Carll album, What It Is, is a manifesto.\n\nWhat it was is gone forever / What it could be God only knows.\n\nWhat it is is right here in front of me / and I\u2019m not letting go.\n\nHe\u2019s embracing the moment. Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "GARY SCHUTT MUSIC ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10280614.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Hard Rock, Power Pop, Heavy Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hard Rock Rising 2012 global battle of the bands finalist!\n\nGary Schutt has basically been a one man solo artist since he was really young.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

George Jones' own widow, Nancy, personally hired James for his first steady gig at the George Jones Museum in Nashville, allowing him to make a living playing music and to hone his hobby-turned-profession in an accelerated fashion. Since then, James has played several shows each week in downtown Nashville at places like The George Jones and AJ's Good Time Bar when he's not on the road, having played over 1500 public, corporate, and private events since January 2015.\n\nIn addition to supporting his young family and connecting with other musicians and songwriters, performing downtown has helped James build a large fan base of folks drawn through the doors by the booming voice echoing down Broadway and 2nd Avenue. Playing so many shows in a relatively short time-frame in a city with an excess of raw talent forced him to sharpen his stage show quickly and continue to refine the thing he's always enjoyed most \u2014 entertaining and interacting with his audiences in a way that leaves most people feeling like they've made a new friend.\n\nJames was the 2018 WSM Road Show Winner, resulting in the opportunity to make his Grand Ole Opry debut opening for Alan Jackson at the Ryman Auditorium on January 17, 2020.

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service. In the upcoming months, fans also have the opportunity to pledge support on Patreon or Bandcamp and receive access to the private Sayla Dobro social feed, an array of special \"awards\", and even a live performance at their own home or business.", "otherInfo": "Live Dobro, electric and acoustic guitar, singing to tracks.

Inspired by \u201890s trip-hop, footwork, and downtempo R&B, Rituals of Mine has crafted a uniquely heavy sound that fuels its cathartic and uplifting performances. For the past decade that Lopez has been actively crafting music, multimedia art, and poetry, she has always seen her creative output as a necessary therapy. \u201cFor a long time I didn\u2019t go to therapy, and I used music as a release.\u201d explains Lopez. \u201cI\u2019m able to convey on stage what I can\u2019t off stage, and these songs that we\u2019ve written and performed\u2014I\u2019ve clung to them as a means of survival almost.\u201d What began as a notebook of poems Lopez kept during her youth in South Sacramento, has evolved into a lush and genre-defying body of work.\n\nAfter two close deaths and a period of reflection in 2016, Lopez felt she needed to reassess her life and her musical project, Sister Crayon. The project was reinvented through Rituals of Mine, and with the new moniker Lopez began writing the most honest and personal songs she had ever written. After years of obscuring her story and emotions through metaphorical lyrics, Lopez felt a sudden confidence to write more directly about her experiences as a queer woman of color. Lopez began fleshing out the songs with her long time collaborator and producer Wes Jones, who helped turn Lopez\u2019s heartfelt writing about trauma and personal growth into urgent and powerful electronic tracks. Lopez then enlisted Adam Pierce to play drums, knowing that their background in metal percussion would provide an intensity that could match her own.\n\nSince releasing their debut, Devoted, in 2016, Rituals of Mine has been praised within the indie music community, and Lopez\u2019s interactive art exhibit that simulates female-identifying people's experiences with street harassment, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, has reached over 200,000 participants. Rituals of Mine has shared its music and message around the world, touring with acts like Garbage, Tricky, Built to Spill, DEFTONES, and Le Butcherettes. The band is excited to release their new EP, SLEEPER HOLD, this fall through Carpark Records. With these new songs and their upcoming live shows, Lopez hopes to continue to inspire audiences in her local community and around the country to overcome their own struggles and indulge their cathartic outpour.", "otherInfo": "No Place Like Home: a livestream benefit series for the Bay Area Music Community!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sabrina and Mike Live ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371701.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Vocal, Jazz, Rock, Covers, Blues, Folk, Originals, Country, Guitar Virtuoso", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sabrina Weeks and Mike Hilliard are very diverse entertainers.

A young DJ and hip-hop / house head Sa'd \u201cThe Hourchild\u201d Ali and an even younger funk fan Chuck Da Fonk Fishman, met in the mid 1990s as touring members of George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic (P-Funk), with Sa'd himself being Dr Funkenstein's nephew.\n\nAfter a deep brainstorm to find new ways to reinvent themselves for the dance music world, Chuck and Sa'd brought Soul Clap, George Clinton and Sly Stone together for a legendary 2013 collaboration at Red Bull Studios Los Angeles. Also instrumental in that historic recording session was 8 time Grammy nominated producer G Koop. The trio - Chuck, Sa'd and G Koop then became FSQ - a production team committed to creating original funk music, across various styles (northern soul, disco, house music) with supreme quality. FSQ formed under the auspices of this P-Funk / E-Funk project.\n\nThen later in 2013, they brought on Chas Bronz, a Boston based Soul Clap acolyte and guitar hero, and One Era, a Philadelphia based multi instrumentalist and producer, to round out the FSQ team.\n\nSoul Clap launched the group in 2014 with the FSQ debut EP, \u201cZulu Congo Call\u201d which got 9/10 in Mixmag and DJ Mag. FSQ remix work for other artists can be found across a variety of labels\u200a\u2014\u200aMidnight Riot Records, ULTRA Music, Boogie Angst, Jalapeno Records, Wolf + Lamb, Bastard Jazz, BBE and many other dance music indies.\n\nSa\u2019d \u201cThe Hourchild\u201d Ali unfortunately passed away in the early summer of 2018. \u201cThe Remix Special\u201d an album compilation of unreleased FSQ remixes of their Soul Clap Records label mates was released in Sa\u2019d\u2019s honor with all proceeds going to his family. Morgan Wiley, from Midnight Magic, was finding himself more and more involved in New York City audio engineering and production work for FSQ, joined the group about this time.\n\nFSQ serves up a fresh taste of funk on their 2020 album \"Reprise Tonight\". Forthcoming on Soul Clap Records, the album features guest appearances by George Clinton & Parliament-Funkadelic, Nona Hendryx, Fonda Rae, Denise King, and Dolette McDonald.\n\nFSQ DJ sets draw upon on their extensive catalog of remix and original productions and quality dance music across a variety of styles including funk, disco, house, northern soul, and their own brand of Sly and Robbie influenced new wave, dubbed \u201cCaribbean Disco\u201d. Today FSQ members Chuck Da Fonk and Chas Bronz carry the DJ torch for Sa\u2019d Ali, who began in his career 1977 as a disco soul DJ.\n\nFSQ also performs their productions live with their rhythm section - The Supreme Qualities - aka The SQ's.", "otherInfo": "Hosted by Chuck Fishman (aka Chuck Da Fonk), Chuck draws upon his intimate knowledge of soul, funk, disco and house to present a diversity of styles and a quality DJ set of music every Wednesday from 12-2PM NYC time on The Face Radio.

Her style fuses influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton Island with Americana grooves and musical innovations, creating a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Hanneke\u2019s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as \u201cexuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.\u201d\n\nA prolific composer, Hanneke writes music from personal experiences of love and loss as well as to commemorate the joys and sorrows in the lives of loved ones. Hanneke\u2019s latest release, Trip to Walden Pond, features traditional Scottish and Cape Breton tunes and seventeen new pieces composed in the Scottish idiom. While her lively style is very much evident, this new album carries a deep, soulful sound with songs of celebration and farewell. Produced by Finnish musician Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 (FRIGG, JPP, Baltic Crossing), the album showcases long-time musical collaborators cellist Mike Block, guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis, fiddler/violist Jeremy Kittel, and pianist Dave Wiesler. Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 contributes guitar and piano to a couple of tracks and piper Samppa Saarinen is featured on the uilleann pipes. Trip to Walden Pond, similar to Hanneke\u2019s five previous albums, offers mellifluous arrangements of traditional fiddle music and original tunes that evoke humor and heart. This latest album also includes several compositions penned by Hanneke as commissions to benefit Many Hopes, a children\u2019s education nonprofit based in Kenya that she avidly supports.\n\nA native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community -- both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser\u2019s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp (run by her husband, acclaimed cellist Mike Block), Harald Haugaard\u2019s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor\u2019s of Music in Violin Performance.\n\nHanneke is a sought-after performer who has graced stages across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. She has been featured at Celtic Connections (Glasgow, Scotland), KVMR Celtic Fest (Grass Valley, USA), Milwaukee Irish Fest (Milwaukee, USA), Celtic Colours (Cape Breton, Canada), WGBH Christmas Celtic Sojourn (Boston, USA) and the National Celtic Festival (Port Arlington, Australia). The Hanneke Cassel Band features Mike Block on cello and alternating guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis.\n\nIn addition to performing with her own band, Hanneke has been featured on PBS with Boston-based fiddle band Childsplay and has performed with Baroque/Celtic group Ensemble Galilei at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (with former NPR \u2018Talk of the Nation\u2019 host Neal Conan) and the National Geographic in Washington, D.C.

For the past decade that Lopez has been actively crafting music, multimedia art, and poetry, she has always seen her creative output as a necessary therapy. \u201cFor a long time I didn\u2019t go to therapy, and I used music as a release.\u201d explains Lopez. \u201cI\u2019m able to convey on stage what I can\u2019t off stage, and these songs that we\u2019ve written and performed\u2014I\u2019ve clung to them as a means of survival almost.\u201d What began as a notebook of poems Lopez kept during her youth in South Sacramento, has evolved into a lush and genre-defying body of work.\n\nAfter two close deaths and a period of reflection in 2016, Lopez felt she needed to reassess her life and her musical project, Sister Crayon. The project was reinvented through Rituals of Mine, and with the new moniker Lopez began writing the most honest and personal songs she had ever written. After years of obscuring her story and emotions through metaphorical lyrics, Lopez felt a sudden confidence to write more directly about her experiences as a queer woman of color. Lopez began fleshing out the songs with her long time collaborator and producer Wes Jones, who helped turn Lopez\u2019s heartfelt writing about trauma and personal growth into urgent and powerful electronic tracks. Lopez then enlisted Adam Pierce to play drums, knowing that their background in metal percussion would provide an intensity that could match her own.\n\nSince releasing their debut, Devoted, in 2016, Rituals of Mine has been praised within the indie music community, and Lopez\u2019s interactive art exhibit that simulates female-identifying people's experiences with street harassment, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, has reached over 200,000 participants. Rituals of Mine has shared its music and message around the world, touring with acts like Garbage, Tricky, Built to Spill, DEFTONES, and Le Butcherettes. The band is excited to release their new EP, SLEEPER HOLD, this fall through Carpark Records.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Jamison Ross (drummer in Snarky Puppy) and Tarriona \u201cTank\u201d Ball present \u201cWTF Now.\u201d\n\u201cFinding a song when you feel there is no song\"\nYou're Bored\nYou've done all the challenges\nYou've Scrolled the Internet\nYou've done all the push ups\nYou've put off one of the most important and easiest thing to constantly put off.\nWriting and finishing that song.\nThe song isn't flowing right.\n\n\"WTF NOW\"\n\nEntry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

She is the daughter of two classical musicians - her father a conductor and composer, her mother an opera singer, musicologist, teacher and bellydancer. No matter which household she was living in, she was \u201calways music-making and creating.\u201d\n\nFresh out of school, she was singing jazz in NYC\u2019s West Village for tips, singing in cover bands and writing songs before signing with Atlantic Records (2003) \u2014a time period that saw her score a Top 40 hit with \u201cDumb Girls\u201d and another Top 5 hit she wrote for Stacie Orrico called \u201c(There's Gotta Be) More to Life\u201d, earning her 2 BMI Awards. With her debut record in tow, she toured the US, Japan and New Zealand and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nBut Woodward had no desire to be a pop starlet: her follow-up, the jazzier, punchier indie record Lucy Woodward is...Hot and Bothered was released in 2008 which \u201cshed new light\u201d on music-making again. Hot and Bothered was inspired by her days at Manhattan School of Music, lots of Etta James and the 1967 classic animated film The Jungle Book bringing her back to her bluesy roots. Billboard described how \u201cLucy's a ball, equally appreciable for fans of melodic sing-along baubles and highbrow aficionados of finely honed musical composition. A sonic turnstile that flips through dreamy pop, jazz and bluesy bebop\u201d.\n\nThis, in turn, was followed by Hooked!, an album of Brill Building meets Big Band songs, released on Verve/Universal (2010) -- which was largely produced by Tony Visconti (David Bowie). The album effortlessly moves across multiple genres, including gypsy-swing, jazz and rhythm & blues. Along with her self-penned compositions, the album showcases Lucy\u2019s stunning covers of Peggy Lee\u2019s Cuban-inspired \u201cSans Souci\u201d and an a cappella Hoagy Carmichael classic, \u201cStardust.\u201d Nellie McKay, who Lucy had always been a hardcore fan of, wrote a song for her called \u201cAnother Woman\u201d which Lucy recorded on Hooked! as well (featuring Nellie on background vocals).\n\nIn 2012, Lucy was asked to tour as a band member filling in for the lead singer of Pink Martini learning songs in Turkish, French Croatian, Japanese and Spanish with 6 days notice. Lucy\u2019s dates with Pink Martini varied from Montreal Jazz Fest to singing with the San Francisco Symphony for several performances. That same year, Lucy has also toured overseas sponsored by Armed Forces Entertainment, performing for American military units stationed in Spain, Italy and Turkey.\n\nLucy began to work with Snarky Puppy bandleader Michael League, who played bass in her NYC band at the time. She started opening for Snarky Puppy (with them as her backing band) and was featured on Snarky Puppy\u2019s Family Dinner, Vol. 1 album singing the hauntingly bluesy \u201cToo Hot To Last\u201d. The album earned them their first Grammy. League and longtime friend keyboardist/arranger Henry Hey (Forq, Rudder, David Bowie) co-produced her fourth solo album Til They Bang on The Door, which was released on GroundUP/Verve/Universal in 2016. The album features the Snarky Puppy horns, Cory Henry on organ and Grammy nominees trombonist Alan Ferber and cellist Dave Eggar as well as many other musicians in their NYC community. She continues to tour with Snarky Puppy and Forq.\n\nIn 2017, Lucy debuted her material with Big Band arrangements from two of her albums performing at Aarhus Jazz Festival and Jam Days with TipToe Big Band in Denmark. She has continued to perform her Big band material in Holland, Miami and Los Angeles. In 2018, Lucy was invited to perform in collaboration with Germany's WDR Big Band with arrangements/conducted by Chris Walden. Together, Lucy and Walden created \u201cLove and Other Bad Habits\u201d, a repertoire of Big Band songs on vices, addictions and other odd human behaviors. Lucy was the featured guest in a 2-week residency with bandleader/trumpeter Dominick Farinacci at Jazz At Lincoln Center in Shanghai, China in December, 2018.\n\nFor much of 2018, Lucy toured with Charlie Hunter. They will be releasing their first debut collaboration Music!Music!Music! in Spring of 2019. The record consists of groove-heavy renditions of blues and classic vintage pop. They will be touring the US and Europe throughout 2019.\n\nIn addition to her solo career, Woodward toured with Rod Stewart for many years singing background vocals. She has also sung on albums by Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Chaka Khan, Snarky Puppy, Barbra Streisand, Nikka Costa, Carole King, Joe Cocker, Michael Bolton, Gavin DeGraw and Randy Jackson. Her songs and vocals have been heard in many movies/TV shows including What a Girl Wants, The Blind Side, Music and Lyrics, New Year\u2019s Eve, First Daughter, Last Vegas, Footloose, Manhattan Nocturne, Accepted and Disney\u2019s Ice Princess, with her rendition of Bjork/Betty Hutton big band cover \"It's Oh So Quiet.\"\n\nwww.lucywoodward.com", "otherInfo": "Next class: The Singer Life!\nw/ guest Stevvi Alexander\n(session & studio singer, vocal contractor, background singer, artist)\n\nSliding scale $1 - $50\nAll levels welcome!\n\n- building vocal strength and range\n- getting work, working as a singer or background singer\n- vocal health\n- studio vocals vs. the road\n- developing your sound\n- vocally blending with others\nvocally\n\nStevvi Alexander has sung with eeeeveryone.

Songs of love, alchemy and life\u2019s journeys. Beautiful vocals, bittersweet melodies and a cheeky pop edge.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, music is often reduced to background noise and treated like a mass-produced product to be sold, even by those who create it. Few in the business give much thought to artistry or how their music impacts those who listen. UK folk-pop duo Faeland is an emerging act that is fully committed to making music that changes lives for the better and adds something good to human existence. Gentle, intuitive, and mystical, the music on Faeland\u2019s debut album All My Swim blends folk traditions from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Singer-songwriter stylings and a dose of pop bring a captivating sound with instant appeal.\n\nFaeland is the brainchild of singer-songwriters Rebecca Nelson and Jacob Morrison, a project designed to break them both out of their comfort zones and to allow them to do meaningful work, not merely start another band. This lead to All My Swim, a song cycle that deals with the deeper themes of humanity like love, healing, and magic. Nelson and Morrison come from families of artists, creatives and healers and this gives a natural quality to these ideas that would flounder in lesser hands. The sound is acoustic guitars and double bass mixed with drums, harp, santour, and violin. Ethereal, bittersweet vocals float across the mix and complete the picture. Echoes of Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac and Gillian Welch are detectable but the vibe is original and individual.\n\nFaeland\u2019s sound and mission pair up well together and create a beautiful vulnerability that is authentic and true. Songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Just A Love Song\u201d, \u201cAll My Swim\u201d and \u201cThe Wheel\u201d offer listeners a seductive realness that rises above all the pushed product out there and must be heard and experienced to be fully understood.

If you've ever seen Driessen perform live you'll swear his violin plays him.\u201d \u2013Nashville Scene\n\n\u201cMonster chops and imagination to match.\u201d - Downbeat\n\n=====================\n\nCasey Driessen has never taken the standard path in his music career. He's always exploring, crossing genres, and questioning assumptions. He\u2019s just as likely to release a video series of creative collaborations as he is to release a traditional album. Described by Zac Brown as \u201ca mad scientist with a five-string fiddle,\u201d the GRAMMY-nominated artist loves to experiment, collaborate, mentor, travel, and push the boundaries of not only his instrument, but of what it means to be an independent working musician in the current climate.\n\nFor the high-energy fiddle player, that has meant a constant juggling of stage and studio, independent media projects, teaching and other opportunities that pique his interest and fit the long-term vision. He's even gone as far as taking short runs for friends like B\u00e9la Fleck doing anything from stage managing to drum tech-ing while also sitting in with the band. He sees those odd jobs as a chance to add new skills to his toolbox or get another perspective on how his peers manage their tours and careers. It's a professional investment in his future and a small price to pay for maintaining creative freedom.\n\nCurrently, the unexpected turn that keeps him busy\u2014yet still free to experiment\u2014is a recent appointment as Program Director of Contemporary Performance (Production Concentration) for Berklee College of Music\u2019s graduate school at their international campus in Valencia, Spain. Hired in the summer of 2015 by his alma mater, he divides his time between family, teaching, leading the program and developing outside projects to ensure that his artistry doesn\u2019t get lost in the day-to-day challenges of running a graduate program.\n\nBut Driessen, never one to wear a single hat, is taking advantage of the location and opportunities that come with his new gig. He divides his weekends and school breaks between family time and diving head-first into the international flavor and collaborations that set him apart from his peers. One weekend that means playing a festival in Norway, while the following might find him going into the studio to lay down tracks for a collaborative project with Estonian fiddler, Eeva Talsi. Or perhaps even sitting in with Paul Simon as his tour passes through Madrid.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Driessen has racked up a catalog and resume that would make any top musician proud.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Rotellini ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7870991.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Performing Arts Center, Host, Speaking, Film, Television, Corporate Event, University, Theater, Mentalism, Stage, Hosting, Vip, Magician, Illusion, Magic, Mentalist", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Modern culture is filled with escapes from reality - from video games to television and film, seeing the extraordinary has become common place. Very rarely though, do we see this happen in a live environment.\n\nSince 2005, John Rotellini has captivated audiences around the world by doing the impossible. A childhood love for magic paired with an eclectic collection of interests led John to develop what has become an obsession. By merging sleight of hand magic and illusions with other disciplines - psychology, con artistry, film, music and theatre, John has created live, interactive events that more closely resemble Hollywood blockbusters rather than traditional magic shows. No longer is the world of the impossible limited to the silver screen.\n\nJohn now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada where he can be found performing select dates in some of the Strip's most critically acclaimed productions and entertaining some of today's hottest stars when not on his own U.S. Tours.\n\nWhether it be performing live in front of thousands, entertaining small groups or executing death-defying large scale stunts, John's performances will be sure to leave you speechless. After all, how often do you get to live the impossible?\n\n\nHistory:\n\nWhen it comes to his shows, John has a very unique way of thinking. Rather than using a traditional audience/performer relationship, John has developed interactive experiences where the audience become the stars of the show. This allows each show to be different than the last and makes for many off-the-cuff and unique moments between John and his volunteers.\n\nAfter several years of honing his craft and performing for people in his home state of Wyoming, John launched his first headlining tour, Locked UP in April of 2009. The show, which opened to sold out crowds included a very special stunt. The spectacle, Rotellini's first venture into stunt work, was entitled -B L I N D- and required John to spend a day without sight, wrapping up with a blind drive through the streets of his hometown in a 2009 Pontiac Solstice roadster.\n\nThree years later, in January of 2012, the show transitioned from it's original Locked UP format into the TOURPOCALYPSE brand. The show, a blend of high-octane illusions punctuated with close up effects, celebrity cameos and what can only be called \"special\" theatrical moments, entertained crowds across the U.S. and led to John's first full-length DVD - John Rotellini: TOURPOCALYPSE Live From The Gryphon Theatre.\n\nFrom late 2011 until early 2013 John spent most of his time on the road. After his critically-acclaimed tour wrapped its run during the middle of 2013, John began developing an all-new show - AGENT PROVOCATOUR which began in 2015 and is currently touring the United States.\n\nOn April 19, 2016, John became the first magician to perform at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV. John joined the Harlem Globetrotters (who were also completing another first for the arena - its first athletic event) to create some very special magic for their 90th Anniversary World Tour.\n\nCurrently, John keeps very busy, raising thousands of dollars for charities that include Kidd's Kids, Children's Miracle Network, Win-Win Entertainment, The USO and Relay for Life while traveling the country entertaining audiences at various colleges, public and private events to rave reviews. He has been fortunate enough to gain sponsorship from Countryman Microphones, American Crew Men's Products and has had the privilege of having EXPRESS Fashion be the official wardrobe provider for some of his tours.", "otherInfo": "Special Win-Win Entertainment Virtual Visit and performance for patients, staff and visiting families of Dignity Health Hospital Campuses in Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Entertainment ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6050112.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Post Punk, Punk", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "E N T E R T A I N M E N T https://twitter.com/#!/ENNNTERTAINMENT we made a band", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Entertainment ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6050112.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Post Punk, Punk", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "E N T E R T A I N M E N T https://twitter.com/#!/ENNNTERTAINMENT we made a band", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Michael ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8794251.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Dark Ambience", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Michael explores marginalised sound design practices - combing field recordings and electronic processing to create dense ambience and dark noise music.", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "the Lawrence Peters Outfit ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351367.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Country, Honky Tonk, Ameripolitan, Traditional Country", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Lawrence Peters Outfit play un-ruined country music, a term Lawrence coined to describe the band\u2019s original, deep-rooted, honky tonk sound.

He developed interest in songwriting and, before long, was looking to put together a band and hosting try-outs for singers. It wasn't until friends told Adam that his voice didn't sound half-bad that he put any thought into singing.\n\n\n\nThroughout the years since, Adam's been involved in several projects - most notably his original band Black Magnolia. The band\u2019s debut album, \u201cFields Are Burning,\" was released in 2012 and featured Randy Jackson of Zebra, who played a guest guitar solo on the song \u201cApocalypse.\u201d He's opened for several major bands in his day including Zebra, 12 Stones, Filter, Puddle of Mudd, and Louisiana Leroux. He\u2019s also played major festivals throughout the South who's had headliners such as Foreigner, Kiss, Doobie Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Temptations, Sublime with Rome, Dee Snider, and Cowboy Mouth.\n\n\n\nAdam's success grew substantially following his appearance on NBC's \"The Voice\". He chose Adam Levine as his coach and made it to the Top 20 on Season 13 (as the \"comeback kid\" from Season 12). Shortly afterwards, Adam Levine invited him to sing for the Maroon 5 Annual Halloween party in 2017. That night they covered only AC/DC songs with Adam Pearce singing, Adam Levine on drums, James Valentine and Andrew Watt on guitar, and Milo Decruz on bass. The night became extra memorable when Sammy Hagar jumped on stage to join Adam Pearce singing \"Highway to Hell.\" The night before, they also surprised guests and performed for the Casamigos Annual Halloween Party.\n\n\n\nIn Decemeber 2017, thanks to the support of his amazing Backers, Adam launched a very successful Kickstarter Campaign which allowed him to bring his newest songs to life with a new album. This new album was recently released October 31, 2018 as Adam Pearce: WARBIRD, featuring Kyle Thomas of Exhorder, Terry McDermott of Lotus Crush, and Paul Mirkovich who's plays keys for and sings duets with Cher.\n\n\n\nAdam can currently be found performing his solo acoustic gigs as well as playing with his full band, Adam Pearce & The Warbirds, all over the state and across the south.

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe. Their show is a carnival of two that will take you from the Moulin Rouge to CBGBs and back again.

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015. Previous projects include Home to You from 2010, Topaz City in 2007; One of the Ways, 2002; Wide Afternoon, 2000; Comfort In the Curves, 1997; and three live releases (Sell-Out, 2006; Live From The Granada CD/DVD 2009 and Live At The Mucky Duck - Portmanteau, 2019).

Produced by John Spiker and Maks Gabriel, Honey County's first summertime single, \"High On The Radio,\" became one of the first songs to receive airplay on SoCal Country radio station Radio Disney Country in mid-2017. Tapped as a trending music video on CMT.com, the song's accompanying video premiered on E! News, shining a light on three singers who were meant to perform together.\n\nReleased later that summer, \"Love Someone,\" also received heavy airplay on E! News, while also receiving nods from Apple Music's 'Cool Country' Playlist and the iTunes Country Music Hot Tracks. With more than 16,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and a new single \u2014 the dark, Fleetwood Mac-inspired \"Los Angeles\" \u2014 under the band's belt, Honey County carried their momentum into 2018, with more melody-heavy songs and cross-country shows on the horizon.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Socorra ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9945219.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Folk Soul, Folk Rock, Rock, Indie Folk, Blues, Indie Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Socorra is a singer-songwriter from the San Jose, California.

His brother, an avant-garde jazz pianist, introduced him to the many different facets of jazz music.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oregon and a short stint as a high school teacher, Tom answered his musical calling. Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper took Tom to New York in 1970 to record the chant classic Witchi-tai-to. After that, he toured and recorded with such jazz greats as Woody Shaw, Joe Henderson, Charles Lloyd and Tony Williams. Since 1983, Tom\u2019s records have repeatedly topped the Smooth Jazz charts.

Entangled with country-pop undertones, her earthy and ethereal sound finds its nuances in the likes of First Aid Kit and Jade Bird.\n\n2019 was a brilliant year for the young songstress, starting out as Caffe Nero\u2019s Artist Of The Month in January, and ending with a UK tour supporting Californian Americana band \u2018Dustbowl Revival\u2019. Tori\u2019s debut EP, \u2018Edge of the Earth\u2019 graced the alternative charts at #26 (Number 20 in Poland!) and continues to gain popularity. From the upbeat folk of \u2018Treading Water\u2019 to the stripped back emotion of \u2018Strangers\u2019, Tori\u2019s EP encapsulates a dreamy, ambient vibe that epitomises the cool yet rustic music roots she has cut her teeth on.\n\nDescribed as \u2018emotive and resonant, whilst still having a heavy hint of \u2018holy shit, she\u2019s on the verge of being a mega-famous popstar\u2019\u2019, Tori is quickly making her mark in the UK music scene!

It also has the media capitol of the world sitting right there in the middle. This Southern Californian duality runs deep in the Los Angeles bred band The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe band is comprised of bass, drums, guitar, piano, pedal steel and banjo. The Alpine Camp could hang with the bluegrass crowd if it wasn\u2019t for the drummer. You could also expect Gram Parsons to waltz through the door since they can chicken pick with the best.

Bell had traveled to Nashville and fallen back in love with country, bluegrass and songwriting in general. When that love turned into melodies, Etienne was there to foster those ideas into finished songs. From there, what started as a one off project, blossomed to include some of the most deft players in Southern California. The musicians who added their signature sounds to those initial recordings have since become permanent and integral members of what is now The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe Alpine Camp has spread their mountain tinged roots rock far and wide since 2014. Since then they have performed at Earth Jam, the California Oysterfest, OC Music Fest and shared the stage with Atlas Genius, The Brothers Comatose, Midnight North, The Motet and Ghost Light amongst many others.\n\nThe Alpine Camp seems to think traditional roots instrumentation and exploratory rock can coexist and so do their fans.

Ever since leaving wildly successful trip-hop group Sneaker Pimps, Corner\u2019s process of becoming IAMX beginning in 2004 has been theatrical, transcendent, and communal. Androgynous and visceral, IAMX has metamorphosed from small-town blue-collar kid to international pop star in the late 1990\u2019s to creator of raw art that disrupts gender and genre in the 2000\u2019s. Fueling electronic experimentation with punk energy and confessional lyricism, Corner\u2019s dark alternative electronic sound, fashion, performances, videos, and persona are larger than life, iconoclastic, and shockingly intimate.\n\n+++ I Forget That There\u2019s A World Outside +++\nGrowing up as a self-described socially anxious geek, Corner\u2019s interest in music was stoked by a \u201cweird uncle\u201d who would play \u201cstrange music\u201d to him. Interest became obsession, and obsession a means through which Corner explored his growing fascination with technology. The interest lingers to this day, as IAMX not only writes and performs, but also produces his own music. The awkward kid who spent a lot of time in his room became the iconoclastic artist who recently spent weeks in a converted homestead in the Mojave desert staring at mountains, mining the silence around him, fastidiously regenerating the muscle memory in his fingers, and practicing, and honing his new album, Echo Echo.\n\n+++ I've Seen Attention - See Through Me +++\nCorner\u2019s adolescent curiosity moved to a new level in his teens when he connected with his older sister\u2019s boyfriend Liam Howe, who became a friend and collaborator. Their first band F.R.I.S.K. released two bedroom-produced EPs \u2013 Soul of Indiscretion, World as a Cone \u2013 that provided an early sonic template for trip-hop in general. The pair also performed as DJs under the alias Line of Flight. In 1995, Corner and Howe formed Sneaker Pimps in Hartlepool, England with support from Kelli Dayton (vocals), Joe Wilson (bass) and Dave Westlake (drums). The newly formed band took rave culture and the pop charts by storm with their 1996 debut album, Becoming X which featured dance-floor classics \u201c6 Underground\u201d and \u201cSpin Spin Sugar\u201d, sold over a million copies, led to extensive touring, and attracted the attention of Virgin Records who signed them.\n\n+++ There\u2019s Something That\u2019s Stirring Deep In Me +++\nIn 1998 the band\u2019s changing creative direction lead to Corner taking over vocals from Kelli, and Splinter was released on Clean Up records in 1999. Splinter fostered a bourgeoning cult fandom, who continued with Sneaker Pimps through the band\u2019s third album Bloodsport (Tommy Boy) and beyond. Soon, Chris realised the band was no longer the right vehicle for where his music was headed, and from this awareness IAMX was born.\n\n+++ I Know You\u2019re Aching To Be Saved +++\nEven though some of the songs on IAMX\u2019s 2004 debut Kiss + Swallow were originally slated to be on the Sneaker Pimps' fourth album, (and IAMX is itself a reference to Becoming X), shades of Chris\u2019 old life quickly faded as his theatrical and gender-bending alias emerged with full force. From 2004 onward, IAMX maintained a hectic recording and touring schedule, moving to Berlin in 2005 at the peak of its electronic renaissance. IAMX released his sophomore album, The Alternative in 2006, followed in 2008 by Live In Warsaw. Kingdom Of Welcome Addiction and its anagram remix album Dogmatic Infidel Comedown OK followed in 2009 and 2010, chronicling a dark phase in Corner\u2019s life. As dark energy seductively does, it produced compelling work, including 2011\u2019s Volatile Times and 2013\u2019s The Unified Field albums, the latter of which is considered a milestone in IAMX\u2019s creative development as a musician and performer. Eventually, however, dark energy claims its toll.\n\n+++ The World Outside May Still Be Beautiful - But I Love This Cell +++\nFollowing a successful world tour in support of The Unified Field, Corner fell into a depressive and insomniac state. His ordeals \u2013 detailed in his personal blog here \u2013 prompted him to move to Los Angeles in sunny California for a change of scenery. \u201cI stopped listening to music for about a year. I stopped making music and it was almost unbearable to listen to music. For instance, I couldn\u2019t watch TV, I couldn\u2019t even drive as it would invoke these waves of existential panic, depression, and exhaustion. I thought I would never be able to make music again but that my enjoyment of it was over. That was a very scary idea,\u201d he explained.\n\n+++ In The Sunlight And The Dust Of California +++\nThe move was a good decision and yielded one of IAMX\u2019s best albums, Metanoia in 2015 and the mini-album Everything Is Burning (Metanoia Addendum) in 2016. Having poured his heart out lyrically on two successful albums and rigorous world tours, IAMX released Unfall (German for accident), an instrumental album to cleanse his creative palette. In 2017, Corner emerged from his depression into a state of euphoria captured on his album Alive In New Light.\n\n+++ The Boys With Their Toys Are Bringing The Void Our Way +++\nIn addition to his success as a songwriter, producer, and touring artist, IAMX is one of the most licensed musicians on ABC TV\u2019s runaway hit show, How To Get Away With Murder. By the beginning of 2019, IAMX had synced 16 of his songs to its soundtrack, becoming one of the most recognizable composers on television thanks to the show\u2019s creator Pete Nowalk being a super fan of IAMX. Another super fan turned collaborator is postmodern tattoo and makeup powerhouse, kindred spirit Kat Von D, who sang on four songs on Alive In New Light and shares IAMX\u2019s avant-garde fashion and design sense, epic stage theatricality, and gender-bending proclivities. IAMX\u2019s provocative aesthetics are not limited to his music and fashion. As a video artist, he crafts IAMX\u2019s stunning live visuals and most of their music videos, as well as videos for other acts, most notably his close friend Gary Numan.\n\n+++ Echoes From The Past +++\nIn the decompression from the electro-fueled passion that had taken IAMX to 27 countries on the Alive In New Light chapter, an old yearning reawakened. 2019 was to be the year that IAMX returned to the device that had been the initiation of his odyssey as a musician. The acoustic guitar. Eleven acoustic re-imaginings of IAMX\u2019s extensive catalogue, Echo Echo heralds the start of a new yet familiar tangent in the enthralling IAMX journey, one which promises the intimacy of his songwriting laid bare.\n\n+++ The Sky Has Opened Up And Now I\u2019m Overcome +++\nIAMX isn\u2019t clear where this newfound liberation will lead him. Rising from a humble working class background to capitalistic celebrity, then down to the depths of despair and back into a new light, IAMX\u2019s armor is now more permeable and his imagination more stimulated by Los Angeles\u2019 unrelenting optimism. For Chris Corner, turned IAMX, the transformative journey that began in his bedroom as a young kid in the North East of England and found its way into the California desert continues. The I AM in IAMX may imply stasis, a fixed state of being, but the X signifies the variable in mathematics and an unstoppable metamorphosis. IAMX will continue to evolve and is fiercely committed to deliver music that transcends genre, defies the rules of the music industry and cuts straight to the heart.", "otherInfo": "***LAST IAMX LIVE ONLINE SHOW***\nAccess: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/iamxacoustic-05-14\nChris performs IAMX songs live on acoustic guitar, vocal mic and various effect/loop pedals.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

It was a cozy place, filled with blue-collar workers who made their living on the water. During the weekends, many of those workers would head over to the Osborne household, where a series of loose, all-night jam sessions filled the Maryland air with the sounds of Bob Seger, Hank Williams, Tom Petty and George Jones. The Osborne siblings strummed their first chords during those jam sessions. From the very start, TJ Osborne was the brother with the voice. He sang in a thick, low baritone, crooning like Johnny Cash long before he was even old enough to drive. Older brother John, on the other hand, was the family\u2019s guitar shredder, his fingers capable of down-home bluegrass licks, arena-worthy rock riffs, country twang, and everything in between. Combined, the two Osbornes could play everything from traditional country music to rock & roll, creating a broad, full-bodied sound that would eventually fill the 11 songs on their major-label debut, Pawn Shop. Like its title suggests, Pawn Shop offers a little bit of everything. There\u2019s bluesy slide guitar, country duets, southern rock solos, harmonies, and plenty of groove. The hooks are big, the guitars are loud, and the songs \u2014 every last one of them co-written by the Osbornes, who reached out to award-winning songwriters like Shane McAnally and Ross Copperman for help \u2014 introduce a duo whose music bridges the gap between the mainstream and the alternative world. Some songs were written at home in Nashville, while others came together on the road, where the guys spent several years headlining their own club shows, touring the country with Darius Rucker, and playing some of the biggest arenas in America with fellow rule-breaker Eric Church. \u201cMost duos are built on singing,\u201d says TJ \u201cBut John is an incredible guitar player, and this band is built on me singing and John playing guitar. It gives us two parallels that work nicely together.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like an old-school rock approach,\u201d adds John, who cites classic bands like Aerosmith and the Allman Brothers as influences on the duo\u2019s dynamic. \u201cGroups like that always had the lead singer as well as the sideman guitar player. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going for, too. We\u2019re carving our own path in country music.\u201d That unique path has already led the band toward the upper half of the country charts. \u201cRum\u201d got them there first, mixing the feel-good sunshine of a beach tune with a far more realistic storyline. There\u2019s no actual beach in \u201cRum,\u201d after all. Instead, Brothers Osborne turn the song into a tribute to the simple pleasures that their Maryland hometown offers: friends, good weather, and the occasional drink. They even filmed the song\u2019s music video in Deale, filling the clip with footage of friends, relatives, and locals. \u201cMost people we grew up with don\u2019t go to these beautiful beaches,\u201d says TJ. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to do it. They don\u2019t have the time for it. What we\u2019re most familiar with is people going to the local bars and hanging out with each other.\u201d John adds, \u201cWe tried to have the biggest time possible with what little we had. \u2018Rum\u2019 explains that.\u201d The brothers agree, \u201cWe had to say it from our own perspective.\u201d A similar theme runs throughout \u201cDirt Rich\u201d and \u201cPawn Shop,\u201d two songs that stress the importance of appreciating what you\u2019ve got. Pawn Shop dishes up plenty of love songs, too, from \u201cLoving Me Back\u201d \u2014 an old-school country duet featuring vocals from Lee Ann Womack \u2014 to \u201cStay a Little Longer,\u201d the band\u2019s biggest hit to date. While a three-minute guitar solo brings \u201cStay a Little Longer\u201d to an epic, anthemic close, Brothers Osborne also devote time to more laid-back songs, from the nostalgic California country of \u201c21 Summer\u201d to the 420-friendly \u201cGreener Pastures.\u201d Brothers Osborne, who co-produced the album with Jay Joyce (the award-winning producer behind Little Big Town\u2019s Painkiller, Eric Church\u2019s The Outsiders, and Carrie Underwood\u2019s Storyteller), recorded most of Pawn Shop during breaks in their busy touring schedule, using members of their own touring band rather than session musicians from the Nashville community. The result is an album that\u2019s stamped with the unmistakable mark of a band. It doesn\u2019t sound like two singers, flanked by anonymous players. Instead, it sounds like a group of road warriors who\u2019ve spent years sharing bus seats and hotel rooms, creating the sort of chemistry that can\u2019t be faked. Pawn Shop is both raw and real, and Brothers Osborne \u2014 who, years after those household jam sessions in Deale, now have a handful of nationwide tours under their belts, songs on the charts, and a career on the rise \u2014 are no longer a family secret.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Built to Spill ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371631.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Built to Spill plays the songs of Daniel Johnston out this MAY.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jack the Radio ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10294862.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Alt-rock, Rock, Alt-country, Americana, Folk, Country Blues, Indie Rock, Country", "Time": "8:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Raleigh, North Carolina roots-rockers Jack the Radio blend rock and blues sensibility with Americana, folk, and country to create a tapestry of swampy southern-tinged sounds on their upcoming album release, Creatures.

It is released in an elegant digipack, with photography by Sarah-Johanna Eick. \"Almost Forgotten Tales\" is a concept album in which 10 pieces of music are interwoven with each another, conjuring up a world of images. It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it. This is not a new idea. But nobody has captured the essence of it like Thomas.\" so Nitze.", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Michael ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8794251.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Dark Ambience", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Michael explores marginalised sound design practices - combing field recordings and electronic processing to create dense ambience and dark noise music.", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Games ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6198605.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Electronic, Chillwave", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Downtown Boys ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7834450.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Dance, Electronic", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Americas booking: alisa@groundcontroltouring.com UK + Europe: matthew.cooper@13artists.com Press: press@subpop.com don't send us fb messages. http://twitter.com/#!/downtownboys http://downtownboys.bandcamp.com", "otherInfo": "Live on Instagram"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eastport Oyster Boys ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10058846.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Celtic, Folk Rock, Boogie-woogie, Indie Maritime Music Heroes", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Proclaimed the Musical Goodwill Ambassadors for the City of Annapolis, the Maritime Republic of Eastport and the Chesapeake... the Oyster Boys have traveled internationally spreading the cheer and the joys of life by the waters of the Chesapeake Bay...", "otherInfo": "Grab a beverage of choice and join us boys for a fun and music filled VIRTUAL SUNSET CRUISE ON SCHOONER WOODWIND...

With a voice that touches somewhere deep inside, Alyssa\u2019s soulful sound and powerful lyrics will send you jet-setting into a broad range of human emotions. Growing up on the open roads of America, with her RCA country recording artists parents, Baillie & The Boys, made it impossible for Alyssa not to witness the power and magic of music. At just 3 weeks old, her cradle was the gentle rocking of a tour bus. Her play ground encompassed sound checks at fairs and festivals and back stage dressing rooms at a slew of different venues including the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Award shows, and her \u201cextended family\u201d consisted of managers, promoters, roadies, musicians and other fellow mainstream country artists.\n\nAt the age of 3, Alyssa performed on the Ralph Emory television show, Nashville Now. Where her version of the Leslie Gore classic; It\u2019s My Party brought the house down in front of millions of national viewers. At age 10, one of those major acts, Kenny Rogers, decided Alyssa was the perfect child singer to record a duet with him on his Christmas CD, Christmas From The Heart. By age 13, Alyssa had her first batch of songs written and received an endorsement from Gretsch Guitars. She had figured out her own unique style of guitar playing with open tunings inspired by Joni Mitchell. By age 16 she landed her first 50 date tour opening up for Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives. It soon became obvious that she was the real deal, not only as a musician and singer but as a prolific songwriter as well.\n\nWhile in high-school, Alyssa became a go-to session singer for people like Christian artist Matt Maher, where she created her own layered harmony vocal approach from years of hearing her parents sing together. Her songs started finding their way into television shows, (Switched! on ABC Family, MTV), movies, as well as getting her first cuts on other artists projects.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Alyssa received a full scholarship from Sennheiser to Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts in Liverpool England, where she would spend the next three years earning a degree in Sound Technology while continuing to perform in local venues throughout Europe. While playing at a venue called The Zanzibar in Liverpool, Alyssa was spotted by Liverpool Rock Star Pete Wylie and was asked to join his band playing electric guitar and singing background vocals. Alyssa of course said yes, and experienced what most artists never experience; a private performance requested by the Queen to help support one of Liverpool\u2019s local charities. A performance with Ringo Starr at the 800th Anniversary of Liverpool\u2019s, \u201cCapital Of Culture 2008\u201d event; a performance slot at one of the UK\u2019s largest music festivals; Knowsley Hall on the same bill as The Who, and from there on scored her own slots performing on the Acoustic stage at Glastonbury in 2009, and a UK tour opening for Raul Malo of The Mavericks.\n\nWhile at LIPA, Alyssa was inspired by their music community and the extreme amount of talented people attending the school. She lived in Lennon Studios, an apartment complex that used to be the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Her incredibly unique experiences abroad inspired her debut album, The English Diaries, an all acoustic intimate collection of songs she produced and recorded herself in her one bedroom Beatles inspired flat.\n\nAfter graduating LIPA and receiving her diploma from Paul McCartney himself, Alyssa returned to Nashville and signed her first publishing deal with Rondor Music. While signed to Rondor, she produced and released her sophomore album Love Hard which was backed by a 10k dollar Kickstarter Campaign and landed one of the biggest nationwide commercial placements of 2012 with her song, \u201cI Make My Own Sunshine,\u201d inspired by Liverpool\u2019s rainy weather. It was featured in a Lowe\u2019s commercial, earning over 50,000 downloads in its first 3 months and over 1 million plays on Spotify. She had no idea at the time that her song would later be heard by Steven Tyler and recorded on his first ever solo album, We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere and that she would be the only solo writer on his debut #1 billboard Country album.\n\nAlyssa\u2019s many other accomplishments in the singer/songwriter community include: Writing with Jeffrey Steele, Michelle Branch, Hunter Hayes, and JD Souther, writing three songs on Jessie James Decker\u2019s top 5 Billboard Country album \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d and co-writing top 40 billboard country radio single, \u201cLights Down Low\u201d, winning Canadian songwriter of the year and song of the year for \u201cI Only Smoke When I Drink\u201d by the Small Town Pistols, co-writing Jana Kramer\u2019s latest country radio single \u201cCircles\u201d and a #17 AC Billboard Chart Christmas duet with Matthew & Gunner Nelson called \u201cThis Christmas\u201d which she wrote with the twins and her father, Michael Bonagura. She\u2019s also had three #1 hits in Australia with Morgan Evans and Chelsea Basham and produced music for Jo Dee Messina & Rachel Reinert of Gloriana.\n\nAt 28 years old, Alyssa has become a songwriting seamstress for a number of artists, a producer, and a band member of the west coast folk & classic rock n\u2019 roll sounds of The Sisterhood Band with friend Ruby Stewart, all while simultaneously having a career as a solo artist. She\u2019s created life long friendships with fellow songwriters, artists and musicians, and has been called \u201cA fixture on Nashville\u2019s indie singer-songwriter scene\u201d by Rolling Stone. It\u2019s been over 4 years since she\u2019s released a solo project, but when you hear her newest record Road Less Traveled, you\u2019ll know it was worth the wait.\n\nAfter an entire summer of recording plans with an outside producer had fallen through, Alyssa turned to her boyfriend Graham Whitford for guidance on what was the best way forward for the songs she so much believed in. They decided to call long time friend and engineer Mark Petaccia to see if he was available to help record at his studio Petti Sound in Berry Hill. By a simple twist of fate, he had 7 days free.\n\nHer closest friends and family who are all a part of the Nashville underground music community decided to come together and help her create Road Less Traveled without the help of a label and purely for the love and support of their friend. The entire album was recorded live, produced by Alyssa & Mark Petaccia, Mastered by Richard Dodd and executive produced by Karen Whitford. Alyssa showcases her multi-instrumental talents by playing acoustic guitar in her signature open tunings, Piano, Ukulele, Lap Steel, Electric guitar, Bass, B3 and Harmonica. She\u2019s backed by Graham Whitford, Caleb Crosby, and Noah Denney (3/4ths of Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown), String arrangers and players Eleonore Denig and Molly Cherryholmes (Mountain Heart), Kevin McGowan, Tarka Layman, fellow artist and songwriter Davis Naish, and her father Michael Bonagura on Electric guitar.\n\nRoad Less Traveled showcases Alyssa as a solo artist in her truest form to date and shares the journey of finding her own voice and paving her own path as an independent Country artist. It encompasses elements of early Sheryl Crow mixed with Joni Mitchell like vocals. You'll hear so many iconic female influences on this project. Alyssa blends them all extremely well to come up with a sound that is familiar in its harkening back to the greats from multiple decades, yet completely unique and unlike anything else one would hear today. Road Less Traveled comes out for pre-order 8.19.16 and will be available 9.23.16.", "otherInfo": "Alyssa will be streaming from IG Live on Vox's instagram for their MiniSessions series!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Ghost ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7014443.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Hardstyle, Electronic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "International DJ/Producer for over 18 years.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

He followed that impulse when he left an Ivy League school to pursue a career in music, and when he moved to LA after seven successful years in Boston. And it was that impulse that compelled him to write a concept album about the search for sanity and empathy in a fractured America. That\u2019s why Jake founded Drunken Logic, a band that \u201cblend[s] more genres and styles than we have room to list, all in the name of creating an eclectic fast-forward sound that\u2019s shaken up after each track\u201d (Vanyaland). Since then, DL has released three critically acclaimed albums and several award-winning music videos, and performed at major events and venues like AT&T Park and First Night Boston \u2014 all while demonstrating profound honesty, scathing wit, and musical fearlessness.\n\nJake\u2019s artistic journey has taken him around the world and back again, with jobs in every corner of the music industry and performances at everything from celebrity galas to improv comedy shows. He\u2019s also participated in grassroots campaigns for automatic voter registration and universal healthcare, and taught songwriting classes to young people trying to find their voices. Despite his busy schedule, Jake still saves time for pickup basketball, urban and rural hiking, and trying new beers based solely on their names.\n\nWith each step forward, DL have been careful to give back to their community by supporting progressive causes and hosting music workshops for young people. In 2016, Drunken Logic donated their song and video \u201cWhat A Beautiful Morning!\u201d to the 30 Days, 30 Songs project for a Trump-free America, alongside artists like Death Cab for Cutie, R.E.M. and more. And this past year, Jake has returned to his home state of California to release DL\u2019s third record, The Loudness Wars \u2014 an unblinking reflection on the forces roiling our country and the people left in their wake. Consistently funny, always honest, and never boring, Drunken Logic is a powder keg of diverse rock music sparked by the American folk tradition \u2014 an inspiring and challenging sound defined by the times in which we live.", "otherInfo": "Jake will be performing Drunken Logic originals and taking song requests on the DL Facebook page!"}]
