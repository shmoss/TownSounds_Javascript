The band expertly blends excessive, force-fueled death metal with atmospheric groove and impassioned personal diatribes, reflecting back the dark state of current events. Their fifth studio album, The Sea Of Tragic Beasts, doesn\u2019t waste time with fantasy bullshit or clich\u00e9 gore horror. Fit For An Autopsy are metal guys, to be certain, but they grew up in the hardcore scene. They embrace the responsibility to put as much devoted purpose into their lyrics and message as they do into their dense, heady, songs, forging a magnificently powerful new \"post-deathcore.\"\n\n\u201cWhen I write a song, I\u2019m trying to feel emotionally connected to it. I really don\u2019t like saying things that don\u2019t matter over music that I want to matter,\u201d says Will Putney, producer/guitarist, principal songwriter and co-founder. \u201cWe\u2019ve always addressed serious topics going back to our first album. Anyone who really looks around at the current state of the world should be able to relate to the aggression, anger, frustration, and sadness often communicated in our music.\"\n\nPutney\u2019s fellow guitarist/co-founder, Patrick Sheridan, strongly agrees. He emphasizes that while the music of Fit For An Autopsy may evolve it will always be aggressive and will always have purpose. \u201cWe think it's important to carry that torch. Somebody's got to say something about what's going on. If you're not using your music, which is a great platform, for something meaningful that you care about on some level, then you're wasting it.\u201d\n\nThe six men of the New Jersey based group \u2013 which includes vocalist Joe Badolato, bassist Peter Spinazola, third guitarist Tim Howley, and drummer Josean Orta \u2013 put maximum intentionality into everything they do. They are constantly challenging themselves as musicians, adding to the band\u2019s overall creative arsenal, connecting with audiences around the world, and supporting one another in the band as individual people.\n\nFit For An Autopsy first summoned one of the most crushing takes on the then-burgeoning deathcore genre with their 2008 demo and the following year\u2019s self-released Hell On Earth EP, which led to a deal with The Red Chord vocalist Guy Kozowyk\u2019s Black Market Activities label.\n\nTheir debut album The Process Of Human Extermination earned them a place among the genre\u2019s giants, cementing them as energizing leaders rather than stale followers. As MetalSucks observed: \u201cThe band\u2019s brutal, glowering take on [deathcore] reminded [us] of the squandered potential of the genre. Hardcore grooves and swagger, when incorporated correctly, blend quite well with death metal.\u201d Fit For An Autopsy\u2019s determined drive, work ethic, and devilishly unmistakable talent next elicited the attention of Good Fight/eOne, the group\u2019s home starting with their sophomore album.\n\nOn Hellbound, Fit For An Autopsy expanded their commanding approach to death metal with hints of various sub-genres by absorbing increasingly diverse elements, from the rhythmic experimentalism of Gojira to the aggressive post-Noisecore of Converge, with a dose of the New Wave Of Swedish Death Metal, and a touch of groove unique to the New Jersey six-piece. The group began to cut their teeth on the road, racking up several full US tours with the likes of The Acacia Strain, Thy Art Is Murder, Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, and Crowbar. Towards the end of this album cycle, the touring took its toll on original frontman Nate Johnson, who amicably split from the band.\n\nRather than take a step back, the third studio album Absolute Hope Absolute Hell served as the recorded introduction of the defining powerhouse vocalist Joe Badolato, whose impressive range helped destroy all remaining self-imposed doubts and boundaries. It\u2019s something the group\u2019s instrumental members had yearned to do as even as they prepared the material prior to enlisting their new singer.\n\nAbsolute Hope Absolute Hell cracked the Top 20 on the Hard Rock Albums chart and hit #3 on Billboard\u2019s Heatseekers chart. As Putney often noted in interviews, the record stood defiantly apart from those that offered little more than thirty minutes of blast beats and breakdowns.\n\nSure, that kind of nonstop pummeling has its place, but Fit For An Autopsy concentrated their focus less on crazy tempo changes and more on atmosphere and vibe, keeping one foot in the crushingly heavy arena while drawing more deeply from traditional metal influences, post-rock, and esoteric nuance. In 2015, the same year as Metal Injection and other tastemakers hailed the group\u2019s progression, Fit For An Autopsy joined the Stronger Than Faith Tour with Suicide Silence, Emmure, and Within The Ruins, followed by a co-headlining tour with Aborted, a trek with Old Wounds, and the Tune Low Die Slow Tour with Acacia Strain and Counterparts.\n\n\u201cBeing out there touring, I can say that our fans have been very accepting of each change and progression,\u201d Sheridan notes proudly. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful, as oftentimes bands are scrutinized heavily as they evolve. We definitely took a step in a direction that people were excited about, and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nPutney points to Absolute Hope Absolute Hell as a definitive moment in the band\u2019s career when they truly came into their own. \u201cI like the earlier records a lot but we were definitely lumped in with a lot of similar-sounding bands at the time. I was happy that we were able carve our own path a little bit more on the last album, which we carry with confidence into the future.\u201d\n\nBetween Absolute Hope Absolute Hell and its follow-up The Great Collapse, the group\u2019s members were able to broaden their creative horizons even further with what became known as \u201cThe Depression Sessions,\u201d a uniquely collaborative project that combined Fit For An Autopsy with their friends in Thy Art Is Murder and The Acacia Strain. Jettisoning the cutthroat competitiveness that often gets between bands, the trio of extreme metal acts joined forces for experimental sessions more akin in spirit to the jazz greats and hip-hop artists, but within the context of heavy music.\n\nAll of that collaboration and experimentation \u2013 to say nothing of Putney\u2019s accomplishments as an in-demand genre producer whose credits include work with both of the bands who joined them in \u201cThe Depression Sessions,\u201d among other genre standouts \u2013 led to an all new focus on the band\u2019s fourth album, The Great Collapse.\n\n\u201cIron Moon\u201d is an aggressive shot across the bow of the status quo, railing against the mundane servitude of the 9-to-5 grind, yearning for a life of meaning and purpose. It\u2019s as anti-establishment in tone as the album is in sound. Fit For An Autopsy break with genre convention even as they reshape and redefine their chosen sonic landscape. \u201cHeads Will Hang\u201d confronts the worldwide refugee problem, demanding empathy, placing the listener in the shoes of someone displaced from their home, hungry to escape into a safer life. \u201cWhen the Bulbs Burn Out\u201d expresses the group\u2019s deep concerns or conservationism sustainability. \u201cBlack Mammoth\u201d was inspired by the conscientious activism of the Dakota Access Pipeline protestors. Other tracks are more abstract lyrically, but no song on The Great Collapse is without intensity.\n\nThe album\u2019s underlying death metal foundation serves as strong support for its more adventurous forays into chaotic hardcore, bits of deathcore, and a meditative, almost droning rumination not unlike the best of shoegaze and desert rock, like a hazy collision between Queens Of The Stone Age and Russian Circles. The omnipresence of rock titans Tool weaves in and out in powerful doses, with The Great Collapse inviting ever more favorable comparisons to Gojira, a band whose evolutionary trajectory is not dissimilar from Fit For An Autopsy\u2019s path.\n\nTwo extensive years of touring followed this release, which debuted at an impressive position of #47 on the billboard top 200. The band circled the globe multiple times, covering an ever expansive fan base opening for the likes of Trivium, Arch Enemy, Hatebreed, Sepultura, and Architects. European festivals, a successful headliner, and another coheadliner with Unearth followed suite.\n\nThe band buckled down in the fall of 2018 to prepare what may just be their defining moment, the Nuclear Blast Records debut The Sea Of Tragic Beasts. The intention of Fit For An Autopsy to truly carve their own path appears to have been triumphantly realized.\n\nThe title track wastes no time demonstrating the unbridled primitive aggression and intensity the group has come to perfect. \"Mirrors\" weaves in and out of saddened passages, chaotic metal, and atmospheric epicness, all while maintaining thoughtful expressions on the human condition. \"Shepherd\" could very well go down as a melodic death metal classic, and it's cascade into the deeply impassioned \"Your Pain Is Mine\" is a shining testament to this band's versatility and musical prowess. Socially conscience themes are once again abundant and blunt. There's an underlying urgency to the personal exploration on this album, and an almost desperation to the tone and delivery of Badolato that truly breaks down the boundaries of extreme music, and crosses into a much more connected conduit with the listener. One thing is clear at the end of this 45 minute journey, there is no stopping Fit For An Autopsy from their realizing their vision as musicians. And in all honesty, who would want to.", "otherInfo": "THY ART IS MURDER + Fit For An Autopsy + Enterprise Earth + Aversions Crown + Une Misere - The Ritz"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "F I N K E L ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8685875.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Soul, Electronic, Indie, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sofar Sounds", "moreBioInfo": "Jane and Brian Spencer of F I N K E L seem to arrive from the near future, or perhaps somewhere out there, appearing with a slight shimmer of a dimension adjacent to our own.

There\u2019s an enchanting quality that pervades the work of this singing and songwriting combo. Their lyrics explore themes of love and desire; understanding oneself and one another beyond surface qualities; and questioning the status quo. With every track, they\u2019re suggesting we take another, closer look, because what we think we see and hear just might deserve inspection.\n\nWhile it remains unclear where these two have been, it\u2019s evident enough that they\u2019re here now. She triggering a MIDI mixing board, he on guitar, their vocals intertwine with a shadowy fluidity that invokes notions of another time; perhaps the middle of next week. They sense you wondering what you\u2019re doing then, and invite you back to the present with a wink.\n\nA tale of two spirits unravels curiously from the seams of F I N K E L\u2019s new singles. Their ethereal synthetic textures and rich vocal harmonies produce an aesthetic that grabs attention and gives it a nudge. The result somehow distills the mood of a strange day\u2019s fleeting moments into a potent, lingering hex. Like the feeling of a passing glance with a mysterious stranger, we\u2019re left assured we just encountered something ineffable, and wondering if someone else felt it too.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "20 Grey St, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Christopher Alexander ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8384715.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.63054, 38.23763], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Psychedelic Pop, Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Folk Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Block Petaluma", "moreBioInfo": "Christopher Alexander is a songwriter from Sonoma County who performs in a style evocative of the 60's and 70's.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "Send an email to: rsvp@foghouseconcerts.com"}, {"Address": "5301 McKee Rd, San Jose, CA 95127", "Artist": "Letitia VanSant ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8131396.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.825821, 37.382891], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Folk, Indie Folk, Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Foothill Community Presbyterian Church", "moreBioInfo": "Letitia VanSant\u2019s lyrics are as personal as they are political, tracing questions of power into the human heart.

Just as his personal experience is never wholly lived on one side of the hyphenate or the other, his music speaks in a voice dedicated to forging a new path forward.\n\nThe current manifestations of that trajectory include his latest project Bird Calls (2015), which was named #1 album of the year by both Downbeat and NPR Music\u2019s Jazz Critics Poll. This 21st Century tribute to Charlie Parker, which Downbeat Magazine recently named Best Album of 2015, includes a stellar band of pianist Matt Mitchell, bassist Franc\u0327ois Moutin, drummer Rudy Royston, and 20-year old trumpet prodigy Adam O\u2019Farrill. The 2013 album Gamak featured guitarist David \u201cFuze\u201d Fiuczynski, whose own microtonal vocabulary opened new possibilities for Mahanthappa\u2019s compositional imagination, alongside bassist Francois Moutin and drummer Dan Weiss. The 2010 release of Samdhi (ACT Music + Vision), a multi-cultural ensemble that advances Mahanthappa\u2019s blend of jazz and Indian music with modernist electronic music, was described by JazzTimes as \u201ca landmark convergence of styles that didn't lend itself to easy analysis... new music of this caliber hasn't been attempted before.\u201d Other recent projects run the gamut from the cross-generational alto summit Apex featuring Bunky Green; trios MSG and Mauger; the quintet Dual Identity co-led with fellow altoist Steve Lehman; and Raw Materials, his long-running duo project with pianist Vijay Iyer. Mahanthappa also continues to partner with Pakistani-American guitarist Rez Abbasi and innovative percussionist Dan Weiss in the Indo-Pak Coalition, while giants in both jazz and South Indian music have recognized his success: he was enlisted by Jack DeJohnette for the legendary drummer\u2019s new working group, while a collaboration with the renowned Carnatic saxophonist Kadri Gopalnath resulted in Mahanthappa\u2019s critically- acclaimed 2008 CD Kinsmen (Pi).\n\nHailed by the New York Times as possessing \u201ca roving intellect and a bladelike articulation,\u201d Mahanthappa has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, two New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowships, and numerous commissions. He has been named alto saxophonist of the year four of the past five years in Downbeat Magazine\u2019s International Critics Polls and for five years running by the Jazz Journalists\u2019 Association.

After an extensive touring career of over 20 years with luminaries like Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Al Jarreau, Stan Getz, David Sanborn, Joe Sample, Cassandra Wilson, Clark Terry, Dianne Reeves and more, she returned to her hometown where she was appointed professor at her alma mater, Berklee College of Music. Terri Lyne also received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 2003.\n\nAfter studying under full scholarship at Berklee, with the encouragement of her mentor, Jack DeJohnette, Carrington moved to New York in 1983. For 5 years she was a much in-demand musician, working with James Moody, Lester Bowie, Pharoah Sanders, and others. In the late \u201880s she relocated to Los Angeles, where she gained recognition on late night TV as the house drummer for the Arsenio Hall Show, then again in the late \u201890s as the drummer on the Quincy Jones late night TV show, VIBE, hosted by Sinbad.\n\nIn 1989, Carrington released a GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated debut CD on Verve entitled Real Life Story, which featured Carlos Santana, Grover Washington Jr., Wayne Shorter, Patrice Rushen, Gerald Albright, John Scofield, Greg Osby, and Hiram Bullock. Other solo CDs include 2002\u2019s Jazz is a Spirit, which features Herbie Hancock, Gary Thomas, Wallace Roney, Terence Blanchard, Kevin Eubanks, and Bob Hurst, and 2004\u2019s Structure, a cooperative group which features Adam Rogers, Jimmy Haslip and Greg Osby. Both CDs were released on the Europe-based ACT Music label and enjoyed considerable media attention and critical acclaim in the European and Japanese markets.\n\nCarrington\u2019s production and songwriting collaborations with artists such as Gino Vannelli, Peabo Bryson, Dianne Reeves, Siedah Garrett, Marilyn Scott have produced notable works as well, including her production of the Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated CD, That Day, as well as Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD, Beautiful Life, in 2014.\n\nCarrington has performed on many recordings throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s thru today. Notable examples of her work include Herbie Hancock\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD Gershwin\u2019s World, where she played alongside Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder. She has toured in many of Hancock\u2019s musical configurations (from electric to acoustic) and is featured on his Future2Future DVD.\n\nAfter a hiatus from the U.S. recording scene as a solo recording artist, Carrington returned in 2008 with More To Say... (Real Life Story: NextGen). Joining her was an impressive all-star cast of jazz and contemporary jazz instrumentalists, including George Duke, Everette Harp, Kirk Whalum, Jimmy Haslip, Greg Phillinganes, Gregoire Maret, Christian McBride, Danilo Perez, Patrice Rushen, Robert Irving III (who also serves as co-producer), Chuck Loeb, Dwight Sills, and legendary vocalists Les McCann and Nancy Wilson.\n\nCarrington released The Mosaic Project in 2011, her fifth recording overall and first on Concord Jazz. The critically acclaimed CD, which won a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, gathered a myriad of voices and crystallized them into a multi-faceted whole that far outweighed the sum of its parts. She produced the 14-song set which included some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades: Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sheila E., Nona Hendryx, Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen and several others. Carrington said the emergence of so many great female jazz instrumentalists over the last couple of decades is what made an album like The Mosaic Project possible.\n\nIn 2013, Carrington released Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue, her much anticipated homage to Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Max Roach, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of their iconic 1963 Money Jungle album. The recording featured Gerald Clayton and Christian McBride, with guests Clark Terry, Lizz Wright, Herbie Hancock and others. Carrington made history when she became the first woman to win a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Carrington releases The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL. Like its predecessor, the album presents Carrington leading a rotating cast of superb female instrumentalists and vocalists that includes Oleta Adams, Natalie Cole, Paula Cole, Lalah Hathaway, Chaka Khan, Chant\u00e9 Moore, Valerie Simpson, Nancy Wilson, Jaguar Wright and Lizz Wright, as well as saxophonist Tia Fuller, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen; bassists Meshell Ndegoecello and Linda Oh; and keyboardists Geri Allen, Patrice Rushen and Rachel Z.\n\nOn The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL, Carrington juxtaposes her salute to female artists by paying homage to various male artists who have either influenced her professionally and/or informed her musicality, such as Nick Ashford, George Duke, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Luther Vandross and Bill Withers. \u201cWhenever I do something that celebrates women, I never want it to feel like it\u2019s something that excludes men,\u201d she explains. \u201cOn this record, I consciously wanted to celebrate the various relationships women have with men either through original songs of mine or cover songs by male composers and song writers.\u201d The male presence and perspective on The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL is even more realized by Billy Dee Williams, who contributes insightful spoken-word interludes through the disc.", "otherInfo": "This evening celebrates the centenary of one of the most innovative and influential artists in modern musical history, but rather than imitating the original, it explores new perspectives on Parker's signature style.\n\nCo-directed by Terri Lyne Carrington and Rudresh Mahanthappa."}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Angie Stone ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8676911.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "R&b, Soul, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "Angie Stone (born Angela Laverne Brown in January 30, 1961, in Columbia, South Carolina) is a Grammy Award-nominated American R&B, hip-hop, and neo-soul singer and actress.

They had a hit in 1980 with \"Funk You Up\". She then worked with Mantronix, before teaming up and performing vocals and saxophone for Lenny Kravitz.\n\n\nAngie Stone emerged during the 1990's as part of hip-hop/R&B trio Vertical Hold which released the popular single \"Seems You're Much Too Busy\" as well as two albums: A Matter of Time (June 1993) and Head First (1995).\n\nIn 1996, she teamed up with Gerry Devaux (Lenny Kravitz's brother) and together with Charlie Mole they formed Devox. One album received a Japanese-only release including Stone-penned or co-written material.\n\nAngie Stone shared song-writing credits on D'Angelo's first two studio album's (1995 - Brown Sugar and 2000 - Voodoo) as well as providing backing vocals on tour with him.\n\nShe released her first solo album, Black Diamond, released on 28 September 1999 via Arista Records.

Yet few artists can empathize with that sentiment quite like the California indie rock project Waterstrider, whose forthcoming Way Out EP arrives on the heels of a series of dramatic setbacks and disasters. Yet instead of being defeated, he took those experiences in stride, incorporating them into this dazzling and complex series of songs, which radiate hope and catharsis in equal measure. Way Out invites listeners into shadowy soundscapes, permeated with rushes of sleek synths and kinetic percussion, that sync perfectly with its open-ended narratives.\n\nWhile Salman demoed these five songs by himself, he completed them in collaboration with the London-based duo St. Francis Hotel, who add a dose of space-age gloss to the project. Largely eschewing the sunny guitar riffs of Waterstrider\u2019s earlier work, tracks like \u201cWeaker One\u201d and the EP\u2019s title track celebrate the lurching bounce of trip-hop, as well as the vast minor-key soundscapes of Mount Kimbie. Echoing the sparse arrangements of Joni Mitchell\u2019s Hejira, closing track \u201cBreed\u201d strips down Way Out\u2019s atmospheric touches, with Salman beginning the song backed only by a humid keyboard figure.\n\nThroughout Way Out, Salman and his collaborators blend digital and acoustic instrumentation to thrilling effect. \u201cI wanted Way Out to sound like a futuristic relic,\u201d Salman explained. Nowhere is that more evident than on central track \u201cIn Circles,\u201d in which Salman layers warm, pulsing synths with crunching drums and raspy veils of feedback into a disorienting sonic stew that reflect the multifaceted emotions threaded through the project.\n\nWay Out considers a world renewed, and explores what it means to be an individual when everything familiar has disappeared from your life.

Her work is reflective of transitions, the wilderness, and its navigation. Sometimes she plays banjo, other times acoustic guitar. Often, she plays a Telecaster fronting her band, The Home Team, featuring pedal steel (Tim Marcus), drums (Nick Cobbett), bass (Oscar Westesson), and various other Bay Area musicians.\nDuring her ten years in San Francisco, McFarling has released five independent recordings: studio albums, Distractible Child (2010) and Ridgeline (2013), an EP of cover songs, Others (2013), and two live albums, Live at Pirate Ship Laguna (2009) and Live at Eddie\u2019s Attic (2011). She has toured behind her own projects as well as performing with bands like Y La Bamba and Goodnight Texas, and is one-third of the all-female folk trio Glittersnatch with Megan Keely and Wolf Larsen. Over the years, McFarling has shared the stage with artists such as Shovels and Rope, Sean Hayes, Chris Pureka, Jolie Holland, and has made a home for herself in the San Francisco music community.\nWater Dog, McFarling\u2019s latest release, is her most intimate and folk-leaning record to date. She recorded the album in seasonal segments of 2016. The songs were first demoed with Allen Rothschild in his bedroom in Asheville, NC, where the creaks of his wood floor and the sounds of summer winding down made their way onto the recordings through open windows and live takes.The demos became the foundation of the record, and McFarling took them back to San Francisco, where Avi Vinocur of Goodnight Texas produced and engineered the majority of the record at his home in the Sunset District. \u201cRecording at Avi\u2019s house gave us the time to let the songs breathe and evolve.\u201d McFarling said of the process. \u201cIt gave us space to make decisions at our own pace. I\u2019ve never made a record like that, and it was a really special time. These songs were written in quiet spaces that were lived in. It made sense to record them in that way.\u201d\nThe album is a reflection on inward motion; on the way that water and its movement dominates our lives and bodies. It\u2019s about love, trust, and how we come to know the things we know. Above all, it\u2019s about the cycles of nature that have the power to be both grounding and destructive. \u201cWhile I was writing these songs, I was thinking a lot about family, stability, and love; and I was simultaneously starting to spend more time in and around the ocean. I was getting in the water a lot, and it opened a conversation about the nature of flow; learning to move with changes, instead of against them.\u201d\nIn addition to producing, Vinocur also plays on most of Water Dog and his work is prominent on signature tracks, like \u201cBoth.\u201d \u201cThat song was totally different when I brought it in. Avi simplified the groove, and made it more compelling.\u201d says McFarling. Vinocur also helped complete the writing of \u201cCaney Fork Overlook,\u201d one of the record\u2019s more classic country tunes. \u201cThat song had been half written for years. I wrote it in my van while on a road trip on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it was one of those songs that I never had expectations for. I wasn\u2019t sure it would be on the record. Avi helped get it to a place where it shines.\u201d In other more stripped down songs, McFarling often played live in one take. \u201cThe Storms are Getting Stronger,\u201d \u201cSpring Clean\u201d, and \u201cBox\u201d are songs that have been played in many different arrangements, mostly upbeat with a full band. For the recordings, I wanted them to go back to what they were when they were first written. Simple, quiet folk songs.\u201d\nAlthough Vinocur and McFarling play the bulk of the instrumentation on the record, they also tapped several trusted Bay Area musicians to explore additional layers of sonic texture.

Her work is reflective of transitions, the wilderness, and its navigation. Sometimes she plays banjo, other times acoustic guitar. Often, she plays a Telecaster fronting her band, The Home Team, featuring pedal steel (Tim Marcus), drums (Nick Cobbett), bass (Oscar Westesson), and various other Bay Area musicians.\nDuring her ten years in San Francisco, McFarling has released five independent recordings: studio albums, Distractible Child (2010) and Ridgeline (2013), an EP of cover songs, Others (2013), and two live albums, Live at Pirate Ship Laguna (2009) and Live at Eddie\u2019s Attic (2011). She has toured behind her own projects as well as performing with bands like Y La Bamba and Goodnight Texas, and is one-third of the all-female folk trio Glittersnatch with Megan Keely and Wolf Larsen. Over the years, McFarling has shared the stage with artists such as Shovels and Rope, Sean Hayes, Chris Pureka, Jolie Holland, and has made a home for herself in the San Francisco music community.\nWater Dog, McFarling\u2019s latest release, is her most intimate and folk-leaning record to date. She recorded the album in seasonal segments of 2016. The songs were first demoed with Allen Rothschild in his bedroom in Asheville, NC, where the creaks of his wood floor and the sounds of summer winding down made their way onto the recordings through open windows and live takes.The demos became the foundation of the record, and McFarling took them back to San Francisco, where Avi Vinocur of Goodnight Texas produced and engineered the majority of the record at his home in the Sunset District. \u201cRecording at Avi\u2019s house gave us the time to let the songs breathe and evolve.\u201d McFarling said of the process. \u201cIt gave us space to make decisions at our own pace. I\u2019ve never made a record like that, and it was a really special time. These songs were written in quiet spaces that were lived in. It made sense to record them in that way.\u201d\nThe album is a reflection on inward motion; on the way that water and its movement dominates our lives and bodies. It\u2019s about love, trust, and how we come to know the things we know. Above all, it\u2019s about the cycles of nature that have the power to be both grounding and destructive. \u201cWhile I was writing these songs, I was thinking a lot about family, stability, and love; and I was simultaneously starting to spend more time in and around the ocean. I was getting in the water a lot, and it opened a conversation about the nature of flow; learning to move with changes, instead of against them.\u201d\nIn addition to producing, Vinocur also plays on most of Water Dog and his work is prominent on signature tracks, like \u201cBoth.\u201d \u201cThat song was totally different when I brought it in. Avi simplified the groove, and made it more compelling.\u201d says McFarling. Vinocur also helped complete the writing of \u201cCaney Fork Overlook,\u201d one of the record\u2019s more classic country tunes. \u201cThat song had been half written for years. I wrote it in my van while on a road trip on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it was one of those songs that I never had expectations for. I wasn\u2019t sure it would be on the record. Avi helped get it to a place where it shines.\u201d In other more stripped down songs, McFarling often played live in one take. \u201cThe Storms are Getting Stronger,\u201d \u201cSpring Clean\u201d, and \u201cBox\u201d are songs that have been played in many different arrangements, mostly upbeat with a full band. For the recordings, I wanted them to go back to what they were when they were first written. Simple, quiet folk songs.\u201d\nAlthough Vinocur and McFarling play the bulk of the instrumentation on the record, they also tapped several trusted Bay Area musicians to explore additional layers of sonic texture. Water Dog features Tim Marcus on pedal steel and dobro, Graham Patzner on fiddle, Andrew Laubacher on percussion, Andrew Brennan on guitars, Oscar Westesson on upright bass, and John Elliott on piano. Austin-based band Whiskey Shivers also makes an appearance singing backup vocals on \u201cCaney Fork Overlook.\u201d\nWater Dog is a first for McFarling in many ways.

Ethereal vocals soar over dubbed-out basslines, and live percussion unfolds over odd time signatures creating a groove that is influenced by the synthetic textures of psychedelic trance as well as the kinetic grooves of world music.\n\nRain developed a love for electronic music early on, and began to hone his DJ skills in 1992, inspired by the early trance and goa releases of labels like Eye Q, Dragonfly, and T.I.P. The psychedelic textures embedded in the music of this era continue to be an influence on his production and style.\n\nNot content to just spin music, Rain established the Phutureprimitive Sound Labs in 1996, and began to acquire the equipment and skills required to express himself musically. Expanding and enhancing the Phutureprimitive aesthetic, Leroy Espiricueta has joined Rain, bringing his talent as a musician and skills as a percussionist to the Labs. The haunting and sensual vocals of Alyssa Palmer also grace several songs on this album. The sonic primitives are working on music together, and exploring the creative process independently.\n\nSomething deep and tribal has been growing in the Labs, unseen and unheard, until now.

The care the group takes in the arrangement of their original music is reflected in their cover choices, known for their dynamic recreations of classic songs by artists ranging from NIN to Black Sabbath and Rage Against the machine, illustrates why it is difficult to put the Dirty Revival in any one genre of music.\n\nDirty Revival has shared the stage with many legendary acts including George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, Michael Franti, The Motet, Gift Of Gab, Lyrics Born, and members of The Meters, George Porter Jr. and Zigaboo Modeliste. Participating in several notable events and venues, including Waterfront Blues Festival (OR), World Music Festival (CA), Arise Music Festival (CO), Upstream 2018 (WA), The Filmore (SF) and many more wrapped into the the several years of multi regional touring they have under their belt. Dirty Revival has also spent time in studio releasing a full length album (self-titled, Dirty Revival) and a 7\u201d record (So Cold).\nOn stage or in your record player, Dirty Revival will captivate you from the very first note and give you a musical experience you will never forget.\n\n\u201c...I've often asked myself what funk would sound like if it was being made today with the same passion it was made with in its heyday.

That music usually isn\u2019t played in the club. Nurko wants to change that.\n\nJack Leech always knew he would be making music, it just took a while for him to find the perfect fit. Growing up in New Jersey in a family with generations of artists, he was encouraged to be creative since birth. Picking up both drums and piano as a child and studying music in college, he applies his classical knowledge of music and music theory to buzzing genre blending sounds as Nurko.\n\nGrowing up on the internet, Nurko experimented by producing music within the trending sub genres of the time, starting with Moombahton, moving to Dubstep, and eventually playing around with Trap, Melodic Trap, and Future Bass. Inspired by both the mature sounds of Amon Tobin and Flume, the pop approved melodies of Jack U, and the fandom inducing energy of Bassnectar, Nurko makes songs that make you remember where you were when you first heard them.\n\nWanting to create a sound he hadn\u2019t heard yet, Nurko decided to channel his emotions into a style of electronic music uniquely him, starting with his first big track, \u201cGoodbye,\u201d in 2015. Since then, his next release \u201cYour Embrace,\u201d continued to give his fans what he likes to call, \u201cthe feels.\u201d They loved it, enough to listen over 2 million times. \u201cYour Embrace\u201d was featured on YouTube channels like MrSuicideSheep, Chill Nation, and was included in \u2018Neptones,\u201d JC Caylon\u2019s compilation that reached number one on the iTunes dance chart.

As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland. He began playing in a variety of Bay Area blues and soul bands in his early 20s, making a name for himself as a hotter than hot live artist. In 1985 he became lead singer and guitarist for the locally popular blues band NiteCry, and began gigging regularly throughout Northern California.\n\nCastro joined Warner Brothers\u2019 artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s, gigging all over the country. He formed the first Tommy Castro Band in 1991, releasing his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig. He hit the road hard, picking up new followers everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Television\u2019s Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label.\n\nCastro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer to massive acclaim. He won four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. His next release, 2011\u2019s Tommy Castro Presents The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue\u2013Live!, was a boisterous and searing collection of highlights from a series of live performances anchored by Castro and an all-star collection of blues giants, including Rick Estrin, Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks and Joe Louis Walker. His relentless road-dog approach\u2014gig after gig, night after night\u2014has won him loyal, lifelong fans everywhere he plays. The Washington Post says Castro is \u201cphenomenal and funky\u201d with \u201csoulful vocals and inspired blues-rock guitar.\u201d\n\nCastro formed The Painkillers in 2012, creating a lean, mean four-piece lineup, capable of delivering soul-shaking, muscular music. The band released The Devil You Know in 2014 and Method To My Madness in 2015, with critics shouting praise and admirers cheering his every move. Castro had stripped his music down to its raw essence with the new, smaller band, sounding bigger than ever. On record and on stage, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers\u2019 road-hardened, seemingly telepathic musicianship bring an unmatched passion to Castro\u2019s blue-eyed California soul and hard-rocking, good-time songs. His hometown newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle, describes Castro\u2019s music as, \u201cfunky Southern soul, big city blues and classic rock...silvery guitar licks that simultaneously sound familiar and fresh.\u201d\n\nWith months of tour dates across the U.S. and Europe, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers will be bringing the songs from their new album directly to their fans. No Depression says \u201cCastro plays gritty, string-bending blues like a runaway soul train...a glorious blend that rocks the soul and lifts the spirits.\u201d Blues Revue says simply, \u201cTommy Castro can do no wrong.\u201d With Stompin\u2019 Ground, he is clearly, once again, doing everything right.", "otherInfo": "Unfortunately, TOMMY CASTRO Livestream has been posponed.

The X-101 to X-102, were Waveform Transmission projects with Mills for Tresor. He slowly progressed to work more and more on his own, but collaberated on some of the first Axis releases with label owner Jeff Mills as H&M (Hood & Mills) with \u2018Tranquilizer EP\u2019 and \u2018Drama\u2019. He soon decided it was time for him to start his own label to focus on what was in his soul musically.M-Plant started in \u201994. I had developed this \u201cgrey area\u201d sound \u2013 what I mean by that is that in Detroit, even when the sun is out, there\u2019s something in the atmosphere. I don\u2019t know if its pollution or whatever, but the sky has that grey haze over it. It\u2019s got to be something from the industrial factories there. I\u2019d never really heard a sound like that before and it came from a Roland Juno \u2013 it was a chord sound that really went along with my depiction of what Detroit was at that time. A lot of buildings were abandoned and there was a lot of lifelessness in the city, especially downtown. The M-Plant, in minimalism, kind of reflected that.I remember thinking of Detroit like a museum. You know, like a work of art standing still, suspended in time. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot of activity going on.Releasing singles such as \u201cInternal Empire\u201d, \u201cThe Protein Valve\u201d, \u201cMusic Data,\u201d and \u201cMoveable Parts\u201d, \u201cThe Pace\u201d, more recently \u201cRange\u201d, \u201cAlpha\u201d and that isn\u2019t even touching his other monikers Floorplan, Monobox, The Vision, etc. \u201cM-Plant is what I\u2019ve always wanted to hear: the basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what\u2019s essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. \u201cIt\u2019s a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound. M-Plant is just M. minimal.\u201dNoncompliant AKA DJ Shiva BIO:\u201cAs her moniker implies, she takes no prisoners, channelling the fury instilled by worldly injustices into blistering, defiant sets.\u201d - Mixmag 2017Raised in small town Indiana on a musical diet of 80s synth pop and punk rock, Noncompliant soon found barnyard raves and warehouse techno parties and (as DJ Shiva) quickly became a fixture of the fabled 90s Midwest USA rave scene.Two decades and a name change later, she is at the top of her techno game.

In the seven years since she first got involved in the electronic music business, she has risen to every challenge with aplomb, working her way up from an intern at Rinse FM to become an influential international selector, with gigs across Britain and beyond. Monki has appeared at many of the UK\u2019s most iconic venues as well as commanding the big stage at festivals on a regular basis. A consistent force within the electronic music scene, Monki operates in a class of her own.\n\nIn her youth, Monki (real name Lucy Monkman) was fascinated with pirate radio. Her love of music and radio led to two pivotal work placements that set her on her current path; the first was at revolutionary station Radio Jackie and, while there, she landed an internship with legendary London broadcaster, Rinse FM. After a year of solid graft behind the scenes, she was offered a Thursday morning slot, which she made her own. Her prowess as a presenter and DJ earned her a promotion to a prime time Saturday slot, and from there the only way was up\u2026\n\nAfter studying at world-renowned music school Point Blank, Monki\u2019s destiny was assured, music became her true calling. The Rinse FM role gave her an abundance of experience and led to the next phase of her broadcasting career, a monthly show on Radio 1\u2019s for In New DJs We Trust which led to a weekly slot on 1Xtra. After a couple of years on the station, she got the call up to join Radio 1 and now hosts a weekly show every Sunday night from 1-4am.\n\nAs a member of the BBC station\u2019s hugely influential team of electronic music tastemakers, Monki channels her knowledge and experience into creating a show that educates and entertains its listeners in equal measure. She now embarks on daily forages for brand new music, working tirelessly to uncover fresh jams to play to her dedicated listeners during the three-hour long show.\n\nMeanwhile, she has appeared at clubs like fabric, Sankeys and The Warehouse Project, together with overseas adventures at festivals like Hideout, Snowbombing and Annie Mac\u2019s Lost And Found. Alongside her solo bookings, Monki also curates her own night called \u2018Monki & Friends\u2019, which has toured the UK, in association with Red Bull and unleashed four killer EPs, featuring music from a variety of talents such as Shadow Child, Mel\u00e9, Joe Goddard, SG Lewis, Riton, Kidnap Kid and many many more.' In 2012 set up her label ZOO Music as an outlet for the huge amount of unreleased jams she was being sent.\n\nA true music aficionado, Monki is not only naturally talented, with an innate flair for DJing, but she is also versatile, dedicated to her craft and genuinely passionate about music in all its forms. With a decade of experience already under her belt, and no let up in her work ethic, there\u2019s no doubt that Monki has earned her place as of the UK\u2019s most respected selectors.", "otherInfo": "Defected USA Tour"}, {"Address": "316 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "DJ J.Remy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8687499.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413792, 37.771362], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Techno, Deep House, Disco, Deep-tech-dub Techno", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Audio Nightclub", "moreBioInfo": "Jeremie Habib (aka.

She managed to record two full-length albums and tour with some of the music world's biggest names even before she hit the age of 20. Her first album drew rave reviews from most critics and put her on the often rocky road toward stardom.\n\nDevon was born in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in the spring of 1982. She grew up in a household filled with music and family and friends. She admits some of her influences include Bikini Kill, Frank Zappa, and even some of the classic rock & roll groups her parents loved, like the Beatles. At a young age, Devon practiced vocal harmony with her father. Later she used his old guitar to strum out her first tentative notes. By the time she was 15, she was putting her musical talents to work, playing in front of local places for change from those who stopped to listen. There was never any other dream in her mind but music, and luckily no one to tell her it was the kind of dream that was out of reach.\n\nWhen Devon was still in her teens, she recorded her debut album, a self-titled offering filled with original songs. That album -- really, her voice on that album -- drew a lot of interest, and in the end landed her a spot touring as a side act with the very popular Dave Matthews Band. One tour turned into two. For 2001, Devon released a second album, LONG SLEEVE STORY, under the Three Word Records label. She had some pretty impressive help on her sophomore release, such as drummer Nate Brown, bassist David Saull, trumpeter John D'earth, and bass player Stefan Lessard, who also served as producer for the album.\n\nDevon's 2003 CD, UPSTATE SONGS, (City Salvage Records) was included in Rolling Stone's \u201cCritics Top Albums of 2003\u201d. Critic Julie Gerstein called the record \u201cperhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year,\u201d and added, \u201cSproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.\"\n\n2007 brought the release of her 'getting-married' (to songwriter Paul Curreri) CD, KEEP YOUR SILVER SHINED (City Salvage/Waterbug). Produced by Jeff Romano in the heart of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, this CD highlights Sproule\u2019s talent for combining Appalachian, folk and jazz influences. From the front porch thump of \"Old Virginia Block\" to the high lonesome traditional \"The Weeping Willow,\u201d featuring fellow Virginia-native Mary Chapin Carpenter, the record finds Sproule making another important contribution to the Great American Songbook. The New Yorker magazine: The nimble singer-guitarist Devon Sproule chronicles her ongoing love affairs with humanity, nature, and the state of Virginia. She performs with a sweet, round diction that shines through even her most ornate imagery and rambunctious melodies. In July 2007 Devon graced the cover of fRoots magazine in the UK; the first American artist on the cover this decade.", "otherInfo": "TURBO DRIVE: PARTY-IN-PLACE WEBCAST\nWebcast Only:\nDevon\nDanny Delorean\nMeikee Magnetic\n\u2022 dnalounge.com/webcast\n\u2022 dnalounge.com/donate\nTurbo Drive: the biggest, and longest running synthwave party in the world!

It usually goes something like this: Imagine a band that mixes [insert well-known indie band here] with [insert famous pop artist here] sprinkled with a dash of [for intrigue, insert descriptive noun here]. And of course, it's usually complete bullshit. Unless, that is, you're talking about SMASH-UP DERBY.\n\nThat's because SMASH-UP DERBY indeed does do all of the above \u2013 quite literally. In fact, they're a totally kick-ass indie cover band \u2013 except the singers think they're in a pop band. So while the band is cranking out rockin' renditions of songs by Nirvana, Franz Ferdinand, the Sex Pistols, or Black Sabbath, the singers are belting out Madonna, Michael Jackson, Christina Aguilera, or Pink - at the same time.\n\nOn paper, it sounds like a train wreck, but in actuality, it melds beautifully. With the band's skillful execution, these \"hybrid songs\" sound like they were always meant to be together. You'll never hear the originals the same way again.\n\nIt's no surprise to discover that SMASH-UP DERBY was started by none other than singer-turned-DJ Adrian Roberts, who went from fronting the well-known San Francisco glam band Blue Period, to becoming an even more popular mash-up DJ and club promoter. Known mostly for throwing Bootie, the first mashup club in the United States, Adrian first conceived of the band in early 2003, thinking it would be fun to do live versions of the bootleg DJ mixes they had been spinning. He soon recruited ex-Blue Period drummer-turned-DJ Matty C., a.k.a. club Bootie's resident rock mashup DJ Dada, and together they created a band to do a one-off show. But it wasn't until a year later that things really kicked into gear, when they somehow convinced three-fourths of SF hard rock band For Madmen \u2013 guitarists Jamie Cronander and Jason Martinez, and bassist Sam Henry \u2013 to join them in this unholy union of indie rock versus shameless pop.\n\nAfter another show, where the crowd response was overwhelming, they soon realized it was just too much fun to do only once a year. A few months later, they were joined by singer Trixxie Carr, who provided the ideal vocal foil for Adrian. When the two discovered they had both won separate \"Best Ass\" contests, they knew they were destined to be in a band together. Now, Smash-Up Derby has an entire repertoire of bastard pop songs, and have released an eight-song demo CD, which they refuse to sell \u2013 instead, they give it away for free at shows. They pride themselves as being known as the world's only mashup rock band, and have a monthly residency at the DNA Lounge, as the club Bootie house band.\n\nHowever, mashing up the music is only part of what makes SMASH-UP DERBY unique. Their stage presentation makes them one of San Francisco's most exciting bands, with singers Adrian and Trixxie playing off each other, bringing a polished sense of glamour and theatricality to the proceedings. Meanwhile, the band \u2013 to put it bluntly \u2013 simply rock out with their cock out. It's a culture clash that's exciting to watch, and even more exciting to listen to.\n\n(from the official Smash-Up Derby website at www.smashupderby.com)", "otherInfo": "BOOTIE MASHUP: CIRQUE DU POLEIL \u25cf Main Room: SMASH-UP DERBY \u25cf (performing live at 11pm) \u25cf Adrian A \u25cf Jimi G \u25cf Lounge: TBA! \u25cf Spinning the best mashups in the world ever, Bootie Mashup was launched in San Francisco in 2003, shamelessly mixing and matching pop songs both throwback and current.

The middle brother K, disturbed from his book by the noise, soon decided to join in, adding his Fender Stratocaster, supernatural songwriting, composition and vocal skills to the mix. The Holy Trinity finally came together at Christmas 2009, when oldest brother Clint was summoned away from a three month tour with some other band. The trio met at the Baechle family mountain aerie, high in the Sierra Mountains, and the demo tape was recorded (Clint on drums). The demo was circulated, with some critical acclaim, and much curiosity as to the real age and relationship of the band members.\n\nUnable to procure a fourth sibling to complete the lineup of the band, the brothers adopted an African child named Melanie to be their bass player and sister in March of 2011. The Stone Loner seven inch was recorded soon after. The band picked up steam, playing gigs around the Bay Area, and lumbering drunkenly up the West Coast for the first time in August 2011.\n\nThe Stone Loner seven inch finally came out (as a split label release with band\u2019s own Magick Hermit Records, and Tombs In The Valley productions from Newcastle, UK.) in February 2012. This was followed by a second West Coast tour. The band continued to ravage the Bay Area throughout the Spring and Summer of 2012, building a reputation as a formidable live act. The first LP (a split label release with Magick Hermit and Lummox records) was released in limited quantity in November 2012, on the eve of the band\u2019s first US tour, which carried them to the East coast and back, through an onslaught of crazy gigs (and crazy weather).\n\nIn August and September 2013 the band toured the West Coast and Southwest United States, and in November and December they toured Europe for the first time.

After an initial hard-scrabble tour in their compact car as a duo, Deb Talan & Steve Tannen\u2019s music appeared in more than a dozen TV shows, as well as several major motion pictures.\n\nTheir iTunes sales topped the folk charts in eight countries. Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol nominated them for a Short List Music Prize, and Mandy Moore asked them to write with her and sing on her album. They were invited to open for the Indigo Girls and invited onto the Hotel Caf\u00e9 Tour; they played the Oxegen Festival in Ireland, the Hurricane Festival in Germany, and T in the Park in Scotland. Their MySpace player hit 2 million plays. JCPenney and Old Navy used their tunes as the theme songs for their major holiday TV campaigns.\n\nWhen The Weepies returned home in 2007, they were exhausted.\n\n\u201c2006 was amazing. Coming off the road in 2007 should have been this blissed-out time with so much to celebrate, but it was totally depressing. Our rented shack in the California hills was cold, it had a leaky roof and there were mice living in it. Our electric guitar had been destroyed on the last plane flight of the year. We hadn\u2019t seen most of our close friends in months.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were empty,\u201d says Talan. \u201cWe both felt dark after being in the bright lights for a year. We were looking to reconnect with what moved us about music in the first place. We needed to hide out and write.\u201d\n\nHIDEAWAY is the result of their year-long struggle to get tapped in again. Another homemade gem, HIDEAWAY is a darker companion to their last album, with 14 new tunes ranging from the upbeat title track to the jangly rock of \u201cNot Dead Yet\u201d to gorgeously arranged meditations like \u201cHow You Survived the War\u201d and \u201cLittle Bird.\u201d\n\nAs with most of The Weepies\u2019 music, there is a happy ending to all the struggle: Deb and Steve were married in 2007, and they had a baby boy, Theo, in October.\n\nThe Weepies sound on HIDEAWAY remains rooted in their unique writing and unusual harmonies.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "65 Capp St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Clementine Darling ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9268259.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418409, 37.765783], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Alt-country, Folk, Americana, Acoustic, Indie", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lost Church", "moreBioInfo": "lementine Darling is a folk singer-songwriter making waves in San Francisco\u2019s music scene.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "316 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "VERLK ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.413792, 37.771362], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Audio Nightclub", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Join us for the debut of FIDELES in San Francisco."}, {"Address": "1511 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117-2912", "Artist": "Justin Rock ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7248992.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.44759, 37.76983], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 PM", "Venue": "Club Deluxe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "jazz"}, {"Address": "Los Gatos, CA", "Artist": "Alina Kiryayeva ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6392757.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.9747, 37.2266], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "2:30 PM", "Venue": "Los Gatos High School Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Alina Kiryayeva is recognized internationally as an accomplished recitalist and collaborative artist.

She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others.\n\nTuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz.\n\nIn 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day.\n\nIn 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan.\n\nThat's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Jock ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433406, 37.764392], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Lookout", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Jock\" at Lookout: The elevated location, long windows, and outdoor balcony give this Castro bar its name, where queers nosh on pizza and dance to DJed music while keeping an eye open for people to meet."}, {"Address": "3248 22nd St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Jazz Revolution ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419552, 37.755527], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:30 PM", "Venue": "Revolution Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jazz Revolution at Revolution Cafe: The walls of this breezy Mission District cafe display a continuously changing exhibition of local visual art, and Papa Toby's diverse music calendar follows suit.

Backed by his band and his years of musical experience Carlos is able rise up and shine. His music has taken his groups all over the world.

I made an album to make you dance, laugh, sing, cry and simply to enjoy listening to. A must for DJ\u2019s and salsa music lovers.\n\nWhen I fell in love with salsa, about 22 years ago, it became my dream to make a salsa album. Especially using the musicians and producers that made the style of salsa that I loved. I never believed it would happen but it did. With this album I plan to bring that style of salsa back that I heard many years ago and make it relevant to today, all while making it my own.\n\nI grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a melting pot of cultures so I had many genres of music in my ear. My song writing style shows that and I\u2019m very proud of it. A first generation born American to parents born in Nicaragua, my Latin roots will always be who I am, and I feel fortunate to have grown up in an era where many styles of urban music were being brought to life.

And when I saw her at BIGSOUND, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her; it was amazing. She is a passionate artist who puts herself wholeheartedly into everything, and she always smashes it\u201d\n- Declan Byrne to Richard Kingsmill for the Triple J 2019\n\nLife-changing serendipity happens only to a chosen few, and that moment took musician-artist Deena Lynch by surprise while playing an Iggy Pop tribute night in her native Brisbane, Australia. After witnessing the unhinged performance of a guy emulating Iggy, she knew she had to up her game. \u201cSo, I cracked down two tequila shots,\u201d she recalls, and then transformed into a bona-fide banshee. \u201cEverything I ever suppressed came spilling out. My shame and inhibitions broke down. I wasn\u2019t afraid.\u201d After that primal performance, she earned the nickname-turned-stage name Jaguar Jonze.\n\nSigned to Nettwerk Records, Jaguar Jonze has released \u201cYou Got Left Behind,\u201d \u201cBeijing Baby,\u201d and \u201cKill Me With Your Love\u201d from her 2020 debut EP. At home in Australia, Jaguar Jonze has garnered the attention of The Music, Fashion Journal, Industry Observer and Tone Deaf, who writes \"to sum up the creative explosion that is Deena Lynch into a neat little elevator pitch would have even the most qualified of journalists in tears.\" Jaguar Jonze was named by Cool Accidents as an \u201cArtist To Watch\u201d for BIGSOUND 2019 and was also named in Richard Kingsmill\u2019s (Triple J) \u201cTop 5 Artists from BIGSOUND 2019.\u201d Deena is also a Triple J \u201cUnearthed Feature Artist,\u201d and made her performance debut on \u201cLike A Version\u201d for a cover of Nirvana\u2019s \u201cHeart-Shaped Box,\u201d alongside friends Hermitude. Jaguar Jonze also competed in Eurovision Australia Decides 2020 with her own original song \u201cRabbit Hole.\u201d Abroad, after features on Spotify and Apple Music playlists, FLAUNT Magazine deemed her \u201cnothing short of a manifold visionary.\u201d\n\nJaguar Jonze\u2019s music is multi-dimensional, representing her multicultural roots with her Taiwanese mom and her Australian Dad. Ultimately, Jaguar Jonze\u2014and its adjacent projects, her narrative illustration project Spectator Jonze and her gender-subverting photography project Dusky Jonze\u2014would become powerful ways in which Deena could process her most intimate vulnerabilities and traumas, while also using it to empower those around her to do the same. Her art in all facets, whether it be her music, visual art or photography is a logical extension of these vulnerabilities with each project mining depths of her personality.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything without meaning,\u201d she says of her visual artwork via Spectator Jonze. Through bold pop art that dabbles in surrealism, she destigmatizes mental-health issues by interviewing her subjects before drawing them. Deena\u2019s 50th portrait came after a year into the project confronted her own PTSD stemming from her unstable, unsafe childhood. \u201cI realized when I stepped out of hiding, I could actually move forward, feel less isolated. I want other people to unburden themselves from the wasted extra energy spent pretending and hiding.\u201d Sometimes she finds her subjects; other times, they find her. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl in the States; she\u2019s still one of my favorite drawings. She reached out to me, having come to terms with her psychosis, depression and anxiety. The level of awareness and openness she had really moved me because I was oblivious to the stigma I still held over the mental illnesses I hadn\u2019t yet been exposed to,\u201d Deena says. \u201cWe still have this pen pal relationship with each other. We\u2019ve never met in person, but I think she\u2019s one of the biggest supports in my everyday life.\u201d\n\nDusky Jonze, Deena\u2019s most recent endeavor uses photography to subvert gender roles and highlight toxic masculinity through intimate portraits. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about toxic masculinity enough. So, I thought it\u2019d be funny to just shoot male photographers,\u201d she says of the evocative nude portraits. \u201cAnd they were open to it. They\u2019d say, \u2019You know what? This makes me a better photographer.\u2019\u201d Consequently, the photo project has grown and become a more fluid effort to undo insecurities and taboos of both the male and female body, within the engendered eye of the photographer. As dramatic as the photos can be, they can also be quite funny. For example, when Deena obscures male genitalia with a banana. \u201cI wanted it to be crass and crude. I like testing boundaries and making people question why they\u2019re uncomfortable,\u201d she says, laughing.\n\nEvery project Deena creates has its unique identities, but each weaves a common thread throughout, tying them right back to Deena Lynch as just herself, the person, each one confronts shame, vulnerability, trauma and taboos in an authentic honest way. \u201cEverything I do stems from the need for dialogue - Jaguar being an internal dialogue with my subconscious, Spectator being an external dialogue with others on mental health and the mind, and Dusky being a dialogue with the body\u201d she explains. In their own way, each is a collaboration, be it literal or metaphoric. Her mission is simple: \u201cI want people to feel. And I want them to think,\u201d she says, \u201cand obviously, I want them to enjoy themselves too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2937 Mission, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Danny Castro ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.417887, 37.750037], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Savanna Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Savanna Jazz Jam with Eric Tillman, Danny Castro, and Nick Fishman at Savanna Jazz Club: Savanna stands out in its neighborhood: it's almost as if a North Beach jazz club dropped a spore on Mission Street.

Stone's music possesses a clear old school soul music influence, and her singing vocals recall those of Aretha Franklin.\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, Stone (as 'Angie B'), was a member of The Sequence, the first major female hip-hop group. They had a hit in 1980 with \"Funk You Up\". She then worked with Mantronix, before teaming up and performing vocals and saxophone for Lenny Kravitz.\n\n\nAngie Stone emerged during the 1990's as part of hip-hop/R&B trio Vertical Hold which released the popular single \"Seems You're Much Too Busy\" as well as two albums: A Matter of Time (June 1993) and Head First (1995).\n\nIn 1996, she teamed up with Gerry Devaux (Lenny Kravitz's brother) and together with Charlie Mole they formed Devox. One album received a Japanese-only release including Stone-penned or co-written material.\n\nAngie Stone shared song-writing credits on D'Angelo's first two studio album's (1995 - Brown Sugar and 2000 - Voodoo) as well as providing backing vocals on tour with him.\n\nShe released her first solo album, Black Diamond, released on 28 September 1999 via Arista Records. She has since also released, via Clive Davis' J Records, Mahogany Soul on October 16, 2001 and Stone Love on July 6, 2004.\n\nMuch of Angie Stone's solo material has a significant hip-hop influence and features notable samples. For example, her first solo single, 1999's \"No More Rain (In This Cloud)\" samples Gladys Knight & The Pips' 1972 \"Neither One Of Us (Want To Be The First To Say Goodbye)\", and 2002 \"Wish I Didn't Miss You\" samples The O'Jays' 1972 \"Back Stabbers\".\n\nAngie Stone sings the theme song for the UPN sitcom Girlfriends.\nShe has two children, a daughter and a son.

Her work is reflective of transitions, the wilderness, and its navigation. Sometimes she plays banjo, other times acoustic guitar. Often, she plays a Telecaster fronting her band, The Home Team, featuring pedal steel (Tim Marcus), drums (Nick Cobbett), bass (Oscar Westesson), and various other Bay Area musicians.\nDuring her ten years in San Francisco, McFarling has released five independent recordings: studio albums, Distractible Child (2010) and Ridgeline (2013), an EP of cover songs, Others (2013), and two live albums, Live at Pirate Ship Laguna (2009) and Live at Eddie\u2019s Attic (2011). She has toured behind her own projects as well as performing with bands like Y La Bamba and Goodnight Texas, and is one-third of the all-female folk trio Glittersnatch with Megan Keely and Wolf Larsen. Over the years, McFarling has shared the stage with artists such as Shovels and Rope, Sean Hayes, Chris Pureka, Jolie Holland, and has made a home for herself in the San Francisco music community.\nWater Dog, McFarling\u2019s latest release, is her most intimate and folk-leaning record to date. She recorded the album in seasonal segments of 2016. The songs were first demoed with Allen Rothschild in his bedroom in Asheville, NC, where the creaks of his wood floor and the sounds of summer winding down made their way onto the recordings through open windows and live takes.The demos became the foundation of the record, and McFarling took them back to San Francisco, where Avi Vinocur of Goodnight Texas produced and engineered the majority of the record at his home in the Sunset District. \u201cRecording at Avi\u2019s house gave us the time to let the songs breathe and evolve.\u201d McFarling said of the process. \u201cIt gave us space to make decisions at our own pace. I\u2019ve never made a record like that, and it was a really special time. These songs were written in quiet spaces that were lived in. It made sense to record them in that way.\u201d\nThe album is a reflection on inward motion; on the way that water and its movement dominates our lives and bodies. It\u2019s about love, trust, and how we come to know the things we know. Above all, it\u2019s about the cycles of nature that have the power to be both grounding and destructive. \u201cWhile I was writing these songs, I was thinking a lot about family, stability, and love; and I was simultaneously starting to spend more time in and around the ocean. I was getting in the water a lot, and it opened a conversation about the nature of flow; learning to move with changes, instead of against them.\u201d\nIn addition to producing, Vinocur also plays on most of Water Dog and his work is prominent on signature tracks, like \u201cBoth.\u201d \u201cThat song was totally different when I brought it in. Avi simplified the groove, and made it more compelling.\u201d says McFarling. Vinocur also helped complete the writing of \u201cCaney Fork Overlook,\u201d one of the record\u2019s more classic country tunes. \u201cThat song had been half written for years. I wrote it in my van while on a road trip on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it was one of those songs that I never had expectations for. I wasn\u2019t sure it would be on the record. Avi helped get it to a place where it shines.\u201d In other more stripped down songs, McFarling often played live in one take. \u201cThe Storms are Getting Stronger,\u201d \u201cSpring Clean\u201d, and \u201cBox\u201d are songs that have been played in many different arrangements, mostly upbeat with a full band. For the recordings, I wanted them to go back to what they were when they were first written. Simple, quiet folk songs.\u201d\nAlthough Vinocur and McFarling play the bulk of the instrumentation on the record, they also tapped several trusted Bay Area musicians to explore additional layers of sonic texture. Water Dog features Tim Marcus on pedal steel and dobro, Graham Patzner on fiddle, Andrew Laubacher on percussion, Andrew Brennan on guitars, Oscar Westesson on upright bass, and John Elliott on piano. Austin-based band Whiskey Shivers also makes an appearance singing backup vocals on \u201cCaney Fork Overlook.\u201d\nWater Dog is a first for McFarling in many ways. It is the first record she has made without a band, the first time she approached recording without a deadline, and the first time she has explored stripped down instrumentation. \u201cFrom the beginning, the idea was always to let the songs speak for themselves and try not to get in the way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "General Admission."}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Erisy Watt ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9101703.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Folk Soul", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Erisy Watt is a Nashville-raised folk artist based in Portland, Oregon.

With every track, they\u2019re suggesting we take another, closer look, because what we think we see and hear just might deserve inspection.\n\nWhile it remains unclear where these two have been, it\u2019s evident enough that they\u2019re here now. She triggering a MIDI mixing board, he on guitar, their vocals intertwine with a shadowy fluidity that invokes notions of another time; perhaps the middle of next week. They sense you wondering what you\u2019re doing then, and invite you back to the present with a wink.\n\nA tale of two spirits unravels curiously from the seams of F I N K E L\u2019s new singles. Their ethereal synthetic textures and rich vocal harmonies produce an aesthetic that grabs attention and gives it a nudge. The result somehow distills the mood of a strange day\u2019s fleeting moments into a potent, lingering hex. Like the feeling of a passing glance with a mysterious stranger, we\u2019re left assured we just encountered something ineffable, and wondering if someone else felt it too.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "62 S Second St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Carlos Mencia ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8561611.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.88904, 37.33618], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "San Jose Improv", "moreBioInfo": "\"If you ain't laughing , you ain't living!\"\n\nwww.carlosmencia.com", "otherInfo": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL Two item minimum purchase required.

The saxophonist/composer hybridizes progressive jazz and South Indian classical music in a fluid and forward-looking form reflecting his own experience growing up a second-generation Indian-American. Just as his personal experience is never wholly lived on one side of the hyphenate or the other, his music speaks in a voice dedicated to forging a new path forward.\n\nThe current manifestations of that trajectory include his latest project Bird Calls (2015), which was named #1 album of the year by both Downbeat and NPR Music\u2019s Jazz Critics Poll. This 21st Century tribute to Charlie Parker, which Downbeat Magazine recently named Best Album of 2015, includes a stellar band of pianist Matt Mitchell, bassist Franc\u0327ois Moutin, drummer Rudy Royston, and 20-year old trumpet prodigy Adam O\u2019Farrill. The 2013 album Gamak featured guitarist David \u201cFuze\u201d Fiuczynski, whose own microtonal vocabulary opened new possibilities for Mahanthappa\u2019s compositional imagination, alongside bassist Francois Moutin and drummer Dan Weiss. The 2010 release of Samdhi (ACT Music + Vision), a multi-cultural ensemble that advances Mahanthappa\u2019s blend of jazz and Indian music with modernist electronic music, was described by JazzTimes as \u201ca landmark convergence of styles that didn't lend itself to easy analysis... new music of this caliber hasn't been attempted before.\u201d Other recent projects run the gamut from the cross-generational alto summit Apex featuring Bunky Green; trios MSG and Mauger; the quintet Dual Identity co-led with fellow altoist Steve Lehman; and Raw Materials, his long-running duo project with pianist Vijay Iyer. Mahanthappa also continues to partner with Pakistani-American guitarist Rez Abbasi and innovative percussionist Dan Weiss in the Indo-Pak Coalition, while giants in both jazz and South Indian music have recognized his success: he was enlisted by Jack DeJohnette for the legendary drummer\u2019s new working group, while a collaboration with the renowned Carnatic saxophonist Kadri Gopalnath resulted in Mahanthappa\u2019s critically- acclaimed 2008 CD Kinsmen (Pi).\n\nHailed by the New York Times as possessing \u201ca roving intellect and a bladelike articulation,\u201d Mahanthappa has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, two New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowships, and numerous commissions. He has been named alto saxophonist of the year four of the past five years in Downbeat Magazine\u2019s International Critics Polls and for five years running by the Jazz Journalists\u2019 Association. In April 2013, he received a Doris Duke Performing Artist Award, one of the most prominent arts awards in the world.

After an extensive touring career of over 20 years with luminaries like Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Al Jarreau, Stan Getz, David Sanborn, Joe Sample, Cassandra Wilson, Clark Terry, Dianne Reeves and more, she returned to her hometown where she was appointed professor at her alma mater, Berklee College of Music. Terri Lyne also received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 2003.\n\nAfter studying under full scholarship at Berklee, with the encouragement of her mentor, Jack DeJohnette, Carrington moved to New York in 1983. For 5 years she was a much in-demand musician, working with James Moody, Lester Bowie, Pharoah Sanders, and others. In the late \u201880s she relocated to Los Angeles, where she gained recognition on late night TV as the house drummer for the Arsenio Hall Show, then again in the late \u201890s as the drummer on the Quincy Jones late night TV show, VIBE, hosted by Sinbad.\n\nIn 1989, Carrington released a GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated debut CD on Verve entitled Real Life Story, which featured Carlos Santana, Grover Washington Jr., Wayne Shorter, Patrice Rushen, Gerald Albright, John Scofield, Greg Osby, and Hiram Bullock. Other solo CDs include 2002\u2019s Jazz is a Spirit, which features Herbie Hancock, Gary Thomas, Wallace Roney, Terence Blanchard, Kevin Eubanks, and Bob Hurst, and 2004\u2019s Structure, a cooperative group which features Adam Rogers, Jimmy Haslip and Greg Osby. Both CDs were released on the Europe-based ACT Music label and enjoyed considerable media attention and critical acclaim in the European and Japanese markets.\n\nCarrington\u2019s production and songwriting collaborations with artists such as Gino Vannelli, Peabo Bryson, Dianne Reeves, Siedah Garrett, Marilyn Scott have produced notable works as well, including her production of the Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated CD, That Day, as well as Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD, Beautiful Life, in 2014.\n\nCarrington has performed on many recordings throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s thru today. Notable examples of her work include Herbie Hancock\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD Gershwin\u2019s World, where she played alongside Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder. She has toured in many of Hancock\u2019s musical configurations (from electric to acoustic) and is featured on his Future2Future DVD.\n\nAfter a hiatus from the U.S. recording scene as a solo recording artist, Carrington returned in 2008 with More To Say... (Real Life Story: NextGen). Joining her was an impressive all-star cast of jazz and contemporary jazz instrumentalists, including George Duke, Everette Harp, Kirk Whalum, Jimmy Haslip, Greg Phillinganes, Gregoire Maret, Christian McBride, Danilo Perez, Patrice Rushen, Robert Irving III (who also serves as co-producer), Chuck Loeb, Dwight Sills, and legendary vocalists Les McCann and Nancy Wilson.\n\nCarrington released The Mosaic Project in 2011, her fifth recording overall and first on Concord Jazz. The critically acclaimed CD, which won a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, gathered a myriad of voices and crystallized them into a multi-faceted whole that far outweighed the sum of its parts. She produced the 14-song set which included some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades: Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sheila E., Nona Hendryx, Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen and several others. Carrington said the emergence of so many great female jazz instrumentalists over the last couple of decades is what made an album like The Mosaic Project possible.\n\nIn 2013, Carrington released Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue, her much anticipated homage to Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Max Roach, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of their iconic 1963 Money Jungle album. The recording featured Gerald Clayton and Christian McBride, with guests Clark Terry, Lizz Wright, Herbie Hancock and others. Carrington made history when she became the first woman to win a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Carrington releases The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL. Like its predecessor, the album presents Carrington leading a rotating cast of superb female instrumentalists and vocalists that includes Oleta Adams, Natalie Cole, Paula Cole, Lalah Hathaway, Chaka Khan, Chant\u00e9 Moore, Valerie Simpson, Nancy Wilson, Jaguar Wright and Lizz Wright, as well as saxophonist Tia Fuller, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen; bassists Meshell Ndegoecello and Linda Oh; and keyboardists Geri Allen, Patrice Rushen and Rachel Z.\n\nOn The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL, Carrington juxtaposes her salute to female artists by paying homage to various male artists who have either influenced her professionally and/or informed her musicality, such as Nick Ashford, George Duke, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Luther Vandross and Bill Withers. \u201cWhenever I do something that celebrates women, I never want it to feel like it\u2019s something that excludes men,\u201d she explains. \u201cOn this record, I consciously wanted to celebrate the various relationships women have with men either through original songs of mine or cover songs by male composers and song writers.\u201d The male presence and perspective on The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL is even more realized by Billy Dee Williams, who contributes insightful spoken-word interludes through the disc.", "otherInfo": "This evening celebrates the centenary of one of the most innovative and influential artists in modern musical history, but rather than imitating the original, it explores new perspectives on Parker's signature style.\n\nCo-directed by Terri Lyne Carrington and Rudresh Mahanthappa."}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "JEFF the brotherhood ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6739659.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Grunge, Alternative, Rock, Psych, Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "The best rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, the kind that gets under your skin and makes all your senses heighten, is simple and comprised of hard work and unrelenting passion\u2014all of which JEFF The Brotherhood. JEFF The Brotherhood embody and exemplify on their Warner Bros. Records debut LP, Hypnotic Nights. Brothers Jake and Jamin Orrall have been playing together since they were little kids and formed the group when they were in high school. The boys grew up with a voracious appetite for any music they could get their hands on. The band incorporates a DIY ethos in everything they do, including their raucous live shows. JEFF have been touring tirelessly for the past 10 years, playing any and all conceivable venues\u2014from basements and backyard sheds to Bonnaroo and The Bowery Ballroom. The duo clocked in over 400 shows in the past two years alone and have shared bills with Best Coast, Fucked Up, Pentagram, The Kills, The Greenhornes and more. When it comes to creating their desired sound, JEFF believes that less is more. This idea is reflected in Jake\u2019s decision to play a guitar with only three strings. Jake explains, \u201cWhen we started the band, I didn\u2019t know how to play guitar,\" he remembers, \u201cI thought, in order to teach myself, it would be easier to play if I simplified it. I started with two strings, but you can\u2019t really play any chords that way, so I added a third string [which added] this interesting limitation that forced me to create my own style and approach to the instrument.\u201d These musical intricacies all come together on Hypnotic Nights, which was co-produced by Jake, Jamin and musician/producer Dan Auerbach (Dr. John, The Ettes). The album was recorded in Nashville at Dan\u2019s Easy Eye Sound Studio in early 2012. JEFF entered the studio focused and prepared with a clear vision for the album they wanted to make, completing Hypnotic Nights in only one week. For any other band, completing an album in seven days would seem like a challenging feat, but for JEFF those seven days felt like a luxury when compared to the amount of time spent on making 2009\u2019s Heavy Days and 2011\u2019s We are The Champions, which were released on the band\u2019s own label Infinity Cat Recordings. Each took only three days to make. \u201cWe\u2019ve never worked with a producer before, so this was the first time we\u2019d ever had any outside input,\u201d says Jamin. \u201cIt was Dan\u2019s first co-production, too, and it really worked. He just hung out, let us do our thing and helped when we needed it.\u201d Adds Jake, \u201cWe write songs without anyone else in mind, so Dan brought in this idea of, \u2018Well, you guys do what you do and I\u2019ll present it so everyone else will understand.\u2019\u201d The result is Hypnotic Nights, an album that uniquely blends elements of indie, punk, garage, and psychedelic rock. The first single, \u201cSixpack,\u201d is a fuzzed-out rocker driven by reverb-heavy riffs and propulsive drumbeats. Songs like \u201cLeave Me Out\u201d and \u201cDark Energy\u201d venture into new musical territory for JEFF, but the band isn\u2019t afraid of experimentation. After all, it\u2019s this imagination and ingenuity that makes Dan Auerbach plainly say, \u201cJEFF The Brotherhood are the next big name in showbiz.\u201d In the end, Jake and Jamin just want to write great songs, play great shows and inspire fans to rock along with them. For JEFF The Brotherhood, blood is thicker than water\u2014and music runs through the band\u2019s veins.

Some even compared his introductory opus to Nas' brilliant \"Illmatic.\" It was enough for XXL to name Fashawn to its list of hip-hop's best freshman.\n\nIn 2010 he toured domestically with Wiz Khalifa, then followed that up with a Talib Kweli tour.

According to Miami-based music writer Karl Ross, \"Guallando\" marked the first time U.S.-born Dominican performers began to mine their musical roots for inspiration. The addictive, resulting sound appeals as readily to rap fans and world music aficionados - and to many in between. Boston Globe music writer Elijah Wald called Fulanito's sound \"fresh and hip, completely different from the mechanical beat of most house fusions\". The word \"Fulanito\" means, roughly, \"Little John Doe\" in Spanish slang. The roots of the word lie in West Africa, where Spaniards kidnapped men and women to be brought to Spanish colonies in the New World. Among the people brought to the Spanish Caribbean were those of the Fulani nation, known in Africa as great merchants. They brought their skills of commerce with them, and eventually it was known in the Caribbean that if you wanted something done, you went to the Fulani, or business guy.\n\nVargas, who is proud of his African lineage, was born in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, one year after his parents immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and grew up in a home saturated with tradition Latin sounds, including his mother's favorites: merengue and bolero.\nIn the early 1990s Vargas scored an international dance/house music hit in English with \"Wiggle It\", recorded by his first organized group, 2 in a Room. The single sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. Vargas formed a follow-up group, the 740 Boyz, with Winston de la Rosa - Arsenio de la Rosa's son.\nWhile hanging out at the de la Rosa household, Vargas was treated to many impromptu concerts by the elder de la Rosa, and was reminded of how excited Dominicans got when they heard the traditional old merengue sounds. Having shunned his parents' music for most of his life, Vargas suddenly became intrigued by the idea of combining rap, hip-hop and perico ripiao. He asked the elder de la Rosa if he would mind experimenting a bit. Soon, the accordionist and the rappers were recording \"Guallando\".\nThe song was completed in 1996, and Vargas played it for friends and family to test the waters. \"They loved it\", he says. \"They went nuts\". He approached several large Latin labels, and was rejected by all. \"They said they didn't think it would sell anywhere outside of New York and the D.R.\"\nFinally, Vargas convinced his house/dance label, Cutting Records, to press a Fulanito CD in 1997. The resulting half million in sales astounded everyone in the Latin music industry, where a mere 50,000 sold represents a gold album.\n\nFulanito's second album, \"El Padrino\" \"(The Godfather)\", was released in 1999. On it, the group experimented even more, incorporating the sounds of samba and other Latin rhythms. Vargas raps about his life, about people he has known, and about having a good time. He was sorry to see the title cut from \"El Padrino\" misinterpreted by some as glorifying gangster life, saying his intention was just the opposite. \"The gangster dies at the end\", he says. \"Sure, he had a lot of money, cars, women, but none of it mattered because he was dead\". Vargas says he wrote it with some of the young men he'd grown up with in mind. Another song on the album, \"Mother's Day,\" shows a softer side of Vargas, as he pays tribute to his mom.\n\nThe group's third album, The Remixes, was released in March of 2001, and contains three new songs. Their fourth album is expected in the fall of 2001. With a solid tour schedule that takes the group from North Carolina to Japan in the span of a month, Fulanito shows no signs of slowing down. In the coming months, Vargas and others hope to more people on the West Coast and in the mainstream U.S. market to their music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1151 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Throwbacks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6310751.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408767, 37.775679], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Pop Punk, Pop, Progressive Punk", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Raven Bar", "moreBioInfo": "We're Throwbacks out of Brick, NJ.

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit. Keep your eyes open for the debut of his new group the \"Megadonz\" in late 2007.\n\nFor more info on MEGADONZ check out their MySpace page at:\nwww.myspace.com/megadonzmusic", "otherInfo": "Open Mic with Brendan Getzell at Hotel Utah: The Old West and indie music come together at the Hotel Utah Saloon, where a small stage, an antique bar, and a diversely stocked jukebox set the scene.

That music usually isn\u2019t played in the club. Nurko wants to change that.\n\nJack Leech always knew he would be making music, it just took a while for him to find the perfect fit. Growing up in New Jersey in a family with generations of artists, he was encouraged to be creative since birth. Picking up both drums and piano as a child and studying music in college, he applies his classical knowledge of music and music theory to buzzing genre blending sounds as Nurko.\n\nGrowing up on the internet, Nurko experimented by producing music within the trending sub genres of the time, starting with Moombahton, moving to Dubstep, and eventually playing around with Trap, Melodic Trap, and Future Bass. Inspired by both the mature sounds of Amon Tobin and Flume, the pop approved melodies of Jack U, and the fandom inducing energy of Bassnectar, Nurko makes songs that make you remember where you were when you first heard them.\n\nWanting to create a sound he hadn\u2019t heard yet, Nurko decided to channel his emotions into a style of electronic music uniquely him, starting with his first big track, \u201cGoodbye,\u201d in 2015. Since then, his next release \u201cYour Embrace,\u201d continued to give his fans what he likes to call, \u201cthe feels.\u201d They loved it, enough to listen over 2 million times. \u201cYour Embrace\u201d was featured on YouTube channels like MrSuicideSheep, Chill Nation, and was included in \u2018Neptones,\u201d JC Caylon\u2019s compilation that reached number one on the iTunes dance chart. His next track, \u201cLet Me Go,\u201d ft. Alina Renae set to be released January 2017 features his signature style of emotional chord progressions mixed with just hard enough drops, complimented with beautiful female vocals.\n\nFor Nurko, the melody is everything. Whether it\u2019s in a low key trap track, or the perfect soundtrack to a your pre-game, do not mistake his music for another soon to be forgotten future bass track. Nurko makes music you can listen to on loop, discovering new layers with each play.", "otherInfo": "Dabin"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Aseptic ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.885544, 37.330047], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Ritz", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "ASEPTIC + D.O.L.

Nabozny \u2013 who has since adopted the artist name CYN \u2013 grew up in Michigan, outside Detroit. After her parents' divorce, CYN, her younger sister and her mom moved to a small house near the lake, a few miles from her dad. CYN's suburban life encouraged her to be a good student, embarking on a path to getting a decent steady job that pays the bills. Certainly something a career in songwriting could not guarantee. \u201cI wanted the typical American life,\u201d she says today. \u201cI didn't know I'd have certain opportunities back then.\u201d\n\nBorn into a humble and hardworking middle class background, CYN is the classic Midwestern gal; her electrician father works midnight shifts at Ford Motor Company six days a week, and neither of her parents' travels have led them far beyond the North America shores. Manifesting her dreams of travel, CYN has undertaken many \"first's\" for her family. Most recently, she can cross visiting Paris, Rome, and Milan off her to-do list. \u201cI'm obsessed with The Louvre,\u201d she laughs. \u201cObsessed.\u201d Despite her small town, conservative upbringing, her dreams have no limit. CYN packed her bags and headed to Hollywood in pursuit of her ultimate aspirations.\n\nGrowing up, CYN pored over the American Songbook. CYN spent a lot of time with her grandmother listening to Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and Carole King. The voices she grew up on were far subtler than some of the belting pop vocals of today. They didn't overpower, and could often be light-hearted in their message.\n\nDuring her teenage years, CYN performed in talent contests, uploaded covers on YouTube, and auditioned for lead roles\u2014all of which failed to produce ideal outcomes. She was rejected by a music school in Chicago, placing her face to face with an unfavorable reality. Opting for a degree in Management Information Systems at the city's DePaul University, she kept making music but never shouted about it and quietly took inspiration from her new city\u2019s surroundings. \u201cI have a big imagination,\u201d she says, wide-eyed. \u201cWhenever I leave my house I want to be able to feel like I'm going on an adventure. I love moving through people, I like to romanticize my life and be a character. I often refer to cities as adult playgrounds \u2013 that's what it feels like hopping on and off the subway, looking at giant buildings, wondering what they are.\u201d\n\nThe name CYN itself is tongue-in-cheek, an evolved Lolita playing on the word 'sin'. She cuts a cute figure, radiating timeless youth like a grown Shirley Temple. Yet she holds herself with a self-assured poise, like something's bubbling under her porcelain surface. \u201cSome men act shocked when they hear that I'm called CYN,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI have a lot of fun challenging people's perceptions.\u201d This girl-next-door would rather run with the boys than be their pin-up. Growing up she was picked on by local kids. She sought recognition from bullies for too long. At last, no more. Hoping that one day she can inspire other small town girls through her music, she contemplates what she wishes she would have known as an adolescent\u2026\n\n\u201cThat I would turn into a girl that I like,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI didn't like my hair, I felt insecure about my body, I had depressive thoughts. Then one day I had a dream that there was this girl on a beach. She had beautiful golden hair wrapping around her and the sun was setting. I woke up feeling so whole because I felt like I knew that girl, and that if I wanted to be that girl I could be.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Tuesday, March 16, 2020"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Uncle Los Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Uncle Los Music"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Last Heroes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10042617.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Electronic, Dubstep", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Last Heroes was formed in Colorado in 2016 with the hopes of creating a platform that would bring people together and remind everyone of their purpose in life.

Stone\u2019s debut for Capitol Records, Radius marks the follow-up to the Chewelah, Washington-bred 28-year-old\u2019s self-released and self-titled sophomore effort, a 2011 album that climbed to the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s Heatseekers chart and gained acclaim from renowned rock critic Ann Powers (whose NPR review hailed Allen Stone as \u201cmeant for those of us who like our R&B slightly unkempt and exceedingly feelingful\u201d). Made in collaboration with Swedish soul singer/songwriter/phenom Magnus Tingsek, Stone\u2019s latest batch of songs capture the warm energy of that creative connection and transport the listener to a higher and more exalted plane.\n\nCulled from several dozen songs penned through a year and a half of constant writing and refining, Radius bears a title that reflects both its scope and intimacy. \u201cThe radius is that line extending from the center of the circle to its exterior,\u201d says Stone, \u201cand in a lot of ways this album is about getting out things deep inside\u2014whether it\u2019s love or insecurity or joy or frustration about things going on today.\u201d Along with immersing himself in a songwriting approach that involved unflinching examination of \u201csome very dark and negative moments in my life,\u201d Stone shaped the sound and feel of Radius by pushing himself to \u201cget past the boundaries of what I felt comfortable with, so that I could progress into a whole new level of creativity.\u201d Despite that sometimes-daunting process, Radius wholly reveals Stone\u2019s easy grace in blending everything from edgy soul-pop and earthy folk-rock to throwback R&B and Parliament-inspired funk.\n\nRadius first began to come to life back in the fall of 2013, when Stone headed to Sweden to join in a writing session with Tingsek. \u201cHis musicality is so outside-the-box, and it really stretched me as an artist,\u201d says Stone, who\u2019d tapped Tingsek as one of his opening acts for an 85-date headlining tour in 2012. \u201cWe just kept on throwing a wrench into the works and tried to create something that\u2019s the complete antithesis of what you\u2019d expect from pop music.\u201d After recording the bulk of the album in Sweden, Stone rounded out Radius\u2019s production at his own studio in the woods of northeast Washington and in L.A.-based sessions with producers like Benny Cassette (who\u2019s previously worked with Kanye West) and Malay (a co-producer on Frank Ocean\u2019s channel ORANGE).\n\nLike many of his own musical heroes\u2014Stevie Wonder chief among them\u2014Stone pulls off the near-magical feat of channeling a weight-of-the-world sensitivity into his songs while still radiating hope and promise. And though that depth of consciousness feels transmitted from a more golden era, Radius continually hones in on issues both timeless and of-the-moment, with Stone\u2019s breezily poetic lyrics touching on topics ranging from rampant materialism (on the tenderly string-accented, harmony-soaked \u201cAmerican Privilege\u201d) and the toxic takeover of technology in art (on the gutsy and groove-heavy \u201cFake Future\u201d). \u201cThat song\u2019s mainly about how technology\u2019s infiltrating music in a way that\u2019s making it less and less human and taking all the heart out of it,\u201d Stone says of the latter track, a soul-pop powerhouse peppered with playfully cutting lines like \u201cRock stars pushing buttons/Few actually play/City wasn\u2019t ever built on lights and Special K.\u201d And as evidenced by Radius\u2019s lush yet raw sonic landscape\u2014wherein the only hint of synth comes from a Moog analog synthesizer\u2014Stone stayed true to his pledge to \u201ckeep fakeness completely out of this record\u201d and rely entirely on live instrumentation.\n\nEqually introspective and outwardly searching, Radius also finds Stone exploring intensely personal matters, such as depression on the stark and lovely, acoustic-guitar-woven ballad \u201cCircle\u201d (\u201cThat one was written at a pretty dark time for me,\u201d Stone points out. \u201cIt\u2019s about how depression can put you into a kind of circle, where you\u2019re just trying to find a way out but it keeps on leading you back inside\u201d). Showing his skill at crafting a killer love song as well, Stone looks at heartbreak and regret on the aching, electric-piano-infused \u201cI Know That I Wasn\u2019t Right,\u201d slips into hopeless romanticism on the dreamy R&B pastiche \u201cBarbwire,\u201d and unleashes some starry-eyed affection on the dancefloor-ready \u201cSymmetrical\u201d (a sample lyric: \u201cThe angle of your spine/Is sending lightning bolts down mine/When those molecules combine/It\u2019s astronomically divine\u201d). And in tracks like the ultra-catchy album-opener \u201cPerfect World\u201d and the fiery, horn-laced \u201cFreedom,\u201d Radius unfolds into epically joyful anthems that show the full range and power of Stone\u2019s vocals.\n\nStone started working those vocals as a kid, thanks largely to his parents\u2019 influence. \u201cMy father was a minister so I spent about half my childhood in church, watching my mom and dad sing together and lead the congregation in song,\u201d he recalls. By the time he was 11 he\u2019d picked up a guitar and written his first song, and soon began self-recording demo tapes to pass along to classmates. Although Stone enrolled in bible college after high school, he quickly dropped out to move to Seattle and kickstart his music career. \u201cI had an \u201987 Buick and I\u2019d drive up and down the west coast, playing any gig I could get just to try to put my music out there,\u201d he says.\n\nAt age 22, Stone self-released his debut album, 2010\u2019s Last To Speak. But it was his self-titled follow-up (on which he joined forces with former Miles Davis keyboardist Deron Johnson) that ended up earning him serious recognition. Along with entering the top five on iTunes\u2019 R&B/Soul chart after its digital release, Allen Stone prompted him to score appearances on such late-night talk shows like Conan and grace the pages of publications like the New York Times (whose chief popular-music critic Jon Pareles praised Stone for possessing \u201ca tenor voice with the eagerness and frisky syncopations of [Stevie] Wonder\u201d). And upon partnering with ATO Records for a physical release of his self-titled album in 2012, Stone soon turned up on the likes of the Late Show with David Letterman and landed a gig as the opening act for soul legend Al Green. In the midst of all the buzz, he also took up a grueling touring schedule, tearing through nearly 600 shows in just two years.\n\nFor Stone, all that time onstage went a long way in preparing him for the many creative breakthroughs he\u2019s made on Radius. \u201cI think you really grow as a musician when you\u2019re playing right in front of people, and for me constantly growing and progressing and getting better is really the most important thing,\u201d he says. Ruminating on the emotional undertones of his new album\u2019s title and noting that \u201cthe center of me is my heart,\u201d Stone says he also hopes that Radius will ultimately help listeners shed new light on their own struggles. \u201cThere\u2019ve been times in my life when records were my saving grace and really helped me to figure out who I am, and I\u2019d love for my music to have that kind of impact on a kid who\u2019s looking for his or her own place in this life,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I absolutely believe that if you\u2019re going to stand at a microphone and say something, you need to recognize that as a privilege. You\u2019ve got to be incredibly careful about it, and really put all your heart into the message that you\u2019re sending out into the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1 Castro St, Forest Knolls, CA 94933", "Artist": "Migrant Pickers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8669475.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.689102, 38.014869], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Aggravated Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Papermill Creek Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "Migrant Pickers\nhttp://www.migrantpickers.com\n\nIf Joe Strummer had come up in Greenwich Village taking guitar lessons from Dave Van Ronk and crate digging for Rev.

Speaking to the struggles we all face as working people, Kiss the Ground sends a positive message while acknowledging real hardship in a society that expects far too much. \u201cWe think of this as our ode to the working people,\u201d says Grant, whose song, \u201cGet in Line,\u201d discusses the high price we pay for things we want in life. Kiss the Ground explores real and mythological connections to the human struggle and pays homage to the \"Working Class Hero,\" an archetype famously described by John Lennon.\nPrevious Grant Farm albums include a 2012 self-titled debut and a 2014 follow up, Plowin' Time, which reached #2 on JamBand Radio Charts and charted on Americana Radio. In 2014, the band also released the Meeting on the Mountain EP, an inspired collaboration with the group Fruition.\n\nThe band has also created the acclaimed Meeting on the Mountain LIVE, a collaborative, live webcast concert experience featuring Grant Farm as the house band and Tyler Grant as host.

In an era where real deejaying skills have become scare, True Justice holds the torch, and is known for tearing clubs down in every city and every town. No stranger to hustle and showmanship, he comes from the era of constantly packing the vinyl crates and being out on the road!\n\nTrue's ambition is to showcase the amount of talent that he has amassed in the last 25 years in Northern California, better known as The Yay Area. While still in high school, True Justice was a hip hop dancer for the Oakland, CA super-group A.P.G. (Action Packed Gangstas), and at the age of 16, he found himself doing concerts with the likes of Digital Underground, Capital Tax, Paris and K-Cloud -- while witnessing first hand the birth of the independent hip hop game in the culturally rich Bay Area.\n\nFrom 1989-91, True studied A.P.G.'s master DJ J-Cutt as he amazed crowds night after night with his show-stealing solo routines with two turntables, a mixer, and two copies of the same record. When he arrived in Berkeley in 1993, True Justice (then known as DJ Skillz), traded his patent leather shoes for two Technic turntables and a Gemini mixer. For years you could see True selling cassette tapes on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, CA alongside favorites of today: Living Legends, Saafir, and the Hobo Junction.\n\nIn 1997, True formed the All Purpose DJs with Lord Takim, DJ Styles, and DJ Lex. That same year he began a career of show deejaying, first with Dream Nefra, and then later with Mic T, AceyAlone & Abstract Rude, Aesop and Planet Asia. As a duo True Justice and DJ Lex released Volume 1 in 1997, Aural Sex Volume 2 in 1998, AP2K in 2000, and Pound Fa Pound in 2004. All releases quickly became local classics. The All Purpose DJs have excited crowds with icons such as Slick Rick, Biz Markie, Notorious B.I.G., Xzibit, Phife, Keak Da Sneak, Above The Law, and E-40.\n\nIn 2004, True and Lex toured in Osaka, Japan, garnering legions of fans of their dexterity on the wheels of steel. A bonafide student of showmanship, True continued to hone his craft, and in 2007, True Justice dropped his self-titled debut album and joined forces with The Bayliens -- \"Aliens from The Bay\" -- and dropped the CD Crop Circles in the same year.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2015, True Justice toured worldwide with The Bayliens, Living Legends, Cali Agents, Mistah F.A.B., Zion I, Paris, The Alkaholiks, Jeru The Damaja, Lords Of The Underground, The Beatnuts, Onyx, Redman and EPMD.\n\nIn 2014, True founded the popular annual Slap Frost Tour with Vocab Slick and Z-Man. In 2016, he dropped his sophomore effort, The Man Of Steel on Guerrilla Funk Recordings.\n\nPress Kit:\nhttp://www.guerrillafunk.com/truejustice/manofsteel_press_kit.html", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $15 Adv & $19 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Gina Madrid ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8078533.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Latin, Hip Hop", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "Gina Madrid formerly Raw-G, Born and raised in Guadalajara Mexico.

Clearly Jody Wisternoff is a man whose personal dictionary doesn\u2019t contain the term \u2018tread water\u2019.\nJody has indeed been pushing the envelope his entire career, which started at the very early age of 13 years when he and brother Sam prodigiously reached the finals of the DMC HipHop Championships. This success was compounded two years later when they found national fame as Tru Funk, landing themselves on the pages of cult magazine The Face and Tim Westwood\u2019s Radio 1 playlist. \u201cObviously it was a different genre to what I\u2019m known for now,\u201d explains Jody, \u201cBristol\u2019s always been renowned for the calibre of its dub scene and the artists that have come out of it. In the late 80\u2018s and early 90\u2018s I was very much a part of that movement, which provided me with an invaluable foothold in the world of dance. I soon found myself DJing to thousands at fondly remembered festivals such as Universe and Fantazia. It was a crazy time.\u201d\nThese formative years were influential too, for it was this background that underpinned the ethos of Way Out West, which Jody founded with Nick Warren following a chance meeting in a local record shop. Fusing Bristol\u2019s dub roots with club beats Way Out West captured a sound unlike any other at that time and burst onto the mid-nineties dance scene with\nseminal hits such as \u2018Ajare\u2019 and top ten smash \u2018The Gift\u2019, which they even performed on Top of the Pops (RIP). When not appearing on nationally treasured TV programmes they could be found remixing the likes of Roni Size, M-People, Orbital, Tiesto, Sasha, BT, UNKLE, James Holden and Fatboy Slim\u2019s Freak Power alter ego; touring the world alongside dance titans Faithless and The Prodigy and collaborating with Trevor Horn, arguably one of Britain\u2019s most successful and revered producers. How many can boast a CV like that?\nBut perhaps most remarkable of all is that, in this highly disposable world of dance, Way Out West continues to this day. Currently working on their fifth album, Jody explains the key to their longevity, \u201cIt\u2019s because we don\u2019t live in each others pockets and take long breaks between WOW projects. In other words, we keep it fresh. It\u2019s a cycle of about 4 years focusing on solo stuff, followed by a year back together, which is great because we bring all our new experiences from this time apart time and feed it back into the band. It\u2019s not something we planned, or rather, do plan, it\u2019s a schedule and process that\u2019s developed over time and works.\u201d\nSo what of Jody\u2019s solo endeavours? Well, if you think these are fallow periods living off the echo of past Way Out West achievements, you\u2019d be very, very wrong indeed. Once again Jody\u2019s incomparable ability to succeed with production and DJing has seen him climb to the highest heights of Beatport (and we\u2019re talking THE overall, not genre chart here) and iTunes;\nremix Above & Beyond, Robert Babicz and more; tour the UK alongside 808 State legend Graham Massey; maintain a monthly show \u2018Intensified \u2019 on Frisky radio, now in it\u2019s eighth(!) year; take on an A&R development role for Anjunadeep signing acts such as Lane8 and Lancelot and, as if all of that weren\u2019t enough, release his own solo album, \u2018Trails We Blaze\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fitting to end this biog as I began,\u201d concludes Jody, \u201cI really am busier now than ever, which is a blessing. Whether I\u2019m in the studio, playing to 5\nthousand alongside A&B at the Ally Pally or touring the world, I\u2019m still as excited by what I do now as I was when I began. The music, style and opportunities may have evolved over the years, but my passion remains the same.
