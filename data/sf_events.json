Yet it is more than the sounds emanating from the speakers, it is also the man behind the decks: warm, compassionate, inviting. He is an entertainer and a catalyst: a magician who mixes deep melodies and sophisticated rhythms into musical journeys.\n\nBased in New York, Atish has cultivated a devoted following around the world. He\u2019s a natural performer who engages crowds with charm and a smile. An obsessive music collector, Atish pulls from a broad sonic palette, and with these sounds he creates intimate atmospheres and emotional experiences that linger in your mind long after the music has stopped.\n\nAtish\u2019s passion goes far beyond the decks as well. As cofounder of the Manjumasi record label, he has created an outlet for other artists\u2019 music as well as his own productions. His work has also found a home on prestigious imprints such as Anjunadeep, Kindisch, and Stil Vor Talent.\n\nAs a pertinent voice in the electronic scene, Atish has also hosted his own Late Night Tonite! Party series, which combines a sit-down talk show interview with an all-night dance party. This format provides a richer context for the music and strengthens the emotional bonds between the audience and the artist. For Atish, it allows him to experiment with what dance music is and what it can be.\n\nIntimacy and connection are the foundations of the Atish experience. His multiple residencies speak to Atish\u2019s ability to resonate with any crowd and highlight the range of his sound. From the blissed-out festival vibes of Desert Hearts, to the big city sophistication of New York\u2019s The Cityfox Experience, and the small club coziness of Miami\u2019s Do Not Sit On The Furniture, Atish brings people together with music and passion.\n\nThis passion can be heard on Atish\u2019s numerous DJ mixes found on Soundcloud. A prolific mixer, Atish finds the DJ mix the perfect format to create compelling narratives of rhythm and sound. Scrolling through his extensive catalog of mixes, one can hear an artist devoted to the music and dedicated to the perfection of his craft. It\u2019s the same devotion Atish receives back from crowds and fans the world over. They understand it\u2019s more than the music and the crowd and the DJ, it\u2019s the magic that awakens when it all comes together.\n\nAtish\u2019s ability to create a special atmosphere is perfectly summarized through his Atish All Night series. With full creative control over the venue, sound, decoration, and music, the party encompasses all that Atish has come to love about dance music through his illustrious career. After sellout shows in LA, New York and San Francisco, the open-to-close nights have established themselves as truly memorable parties. After all, it is the uncompromised Atish experience.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SHEL ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10300511.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop, Folk", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When the gatekeepers of the music world tried to contain the superpowers of four creative sisters - walls fell.

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dan Andriano ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9714262.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Acoustic, Folk", "Time": "10:59 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dan Andriano (born 1977 in Elgin, Illinois) is the bassist and co-vocalist (alongside vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba and drummer Derek Grant) for the punk rock band Alkaline Trio.

A half-hour later, he called back to change it to Won-Ton Haggis. But neither sounded right, and Enter the Haggis seemed to flow.\n\n\"It's like Enter the Dragon, but a lot messier,\" said Downie. \"It ended up sticking ... but it's not the sort of name we expected to go with.\"\n\nDownie -- a native of Glasgow, Scotland, expatriated to Ontario with his parents at age 7 -- enjoys a good haggis \"if it's cooked properly. If I had a couple of pints first, it's even better.\"\n\nHaggis, for those not in the know, is a traditional Scottish dish made of minced sheep's innards, oatmeal and a varied assortment of other ingredients. Enter the Haggis, on the other hand, is an energetic Celtic rock band from Toronto.\n\nDownie, pulled from a Toronto recording studio for this interview, is the band's founder, primary kilt-wearer, singer, bagpiper and chief songwriter. He has a penchant for inserting odd imagery into his music.\n\nSongs on the band's first album, Let the Wind Blow High, deal with the likes of Scottish-Mexican brawlers, bagpipers in space and \"loch monsters\" of a different sort.\n\n\"I came from Scotland as a kid,\" Downie said, as if that explains everything. Since it didn't, he continued. \"I wanted to know more about my culture, but most of what I could find out was the Hollywood version of Scotland,\" he explained. \"I watched Brigadoon and things like that, which portrayed Scotland in a comical light. ... I thought, 'There's a lot of comedy coming out of Scotland.' So I started putting it together.\"\n\nHe finds ideas for songwriting in various places, from a Mexican native with a Scottish education and accent to headlines about Lorena Bobbit's exercise in extreme circumcision.\n\nDownie is by no means a traditional piper, either, drawing on a variety of musical styles to create his own unique sound.\n\n\"I'd like to think of myself as an entertaining pipe player more than anything else,\" he said. \"If I can get a different sound out of my pipes and keep people interested -- that's my job and that's my hobby.\"\n\nDownie, who recently delayed recording to get married, buy a house and go on tour, said he finds musical inspiration in everything from early Beatles and Led Zeppelin to the pibroch, the classical music of the Highland pipe.\n\n\"The pipes were the first rock 'n' roll instrument,\" he insisted. \"With what other instrument can you get up and cut a swath through a room of 200 people?\"\n\nBesides Downie, Enter the Haggis is Trevor Lewington (electric and acoustic guitars), James \"Seumas\" Campbell (drums), Brian Buchanan (fiddle) and Mark Abraham (bass). The band, with its second album in the works, is hoping to help bands like Seven Nations spread Celtic \"bagpipe rock\" to the masses.\n\n\"I would like to see Celtic rock become a dominant force in music,\" Downie said. \"Rock music has really become kind of homogenous. I don't know where it's going to go these days. You turn on the radio and one song sounds like the next. \"I would like to take Celtic rock to its epitome.\"\n\nThe band's evolution is already underway, he noted. \"We're a tighter band than we were before -- just from doing a lot more playing. Our sound has become a bit more dynamic,\" Downie said.\n\n\"It's got a bit more of an electric feel to it for sure. We're trying to get a bit more power into it,\" he added. \"It's 'more good.'\"\n\nThe band's biggest joy comes from live performances, jamming on-stage with a jammin' mix of traditional tunes, original material and plenty of humor. While they once bribed audiences with T-shirts and CDs to get them up and moving, that no longer seems to be a problem.\n\n\"We played recently at the Mosiac Festival out in Regina,\" Downie recalled. \"The stage was swarmed by about 200 people. ... Nobody got hurt or killed or anything, so I guess it was a good show.\n\n\"Of course, there's always a potential for mishaps. Last week, an older gentleman leapt up on stage, embraced our guitarist and kissed him.

In 2008, Todd won the Soaring Eagle Casino Idol Contest. Since then, Todd has performed with many great musicians as lead vocalist for Michigan cover bands Detroit Dixie, Kickin\u2019 Dust, and Taylor Tucky.

Rob notes, \u201cI grew up on KISS, Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, and all the 70\u2019s rock and roll. If you have told me 15 years ago that I would be playing country music, I would have laughed. This new generation of country is a lot more rock than it was 10 years ago. There are a lot of great guitar players in the country music scene!\u201d Rob\u2019s guitar playing has that edge that the new generation of country demands, plus he still has that country \u201ctwang\u201d in his back pocket when he needs it.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

But when it came time to record Kintsugi, Death Cab for Cutie went into the studio with the openest of minds. Their willingness to try anything \u2014 including a twenty-minute exploration that evolved into one of the album's finest tracks, \"The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive\" \u2014 yields Death Cab's most compelling new work in years: an album that packs as much sonic as it does emotional wallop.\nKintsugi is the band's first time recording with a producer other than their own Chris Walla, the guitarist and multi-instrumentalist whose talents behind the board had helped shape Death Cab's sound since Gibbard released the You Can Play These Songs With Chords cassette in 1997. For Kintsugi, they worked with Rich Costey (whose production credits include albums by Franz Ferdinand, Muse, and Interpol), recording at his Los Angeles studio Eldorado over the course of twelve weeks in the first half of 2014. \"He was all in in a way that I don't think a lot of producers are nowadays,\" says Gibbard. \"We couldn't have landed on a better collaborator for this record. He accomplished what we've always attempted, which is to make Death Cab sound on a record how we sound live. And we're a rock band live. The difficulty now for the live show is making them rock as hard as they rock on the record. That's a new quagmire for this band.\"\nWork on Kintsugi began back in early 2013, as all Death Cab LPs have, with Gibbard writing and demoing the songs on his own before arranging and recording them with his band mates. They initially convened in fall of 2013 at Walla's Hall Of Justice studio in Seattle. Ten days into recording, Chris decided to step down as producer. Says Gibbard. \"Nothing dramatic, he just said, 'I don't think I'm the right guy to do this album and we should find someone else.'\" The band all felt that they needed to shake things up a bit. \"We challenged each other more and left no stone unturned. That was as gratifying as it was frustrating at times, but I couldn't be happier with the end product,\" says McGerr. Walla has since decided to leave the band but participated in the recording process as fully and vitally as he had on their previous albums. In fact, Costey didn't even know Walla was leaving the band until after Kintsugi was finished. Chris played his final show with the band in September at Rifflandia Festival in British Columbia.\nWhen they started recording, there weren't any rules at all. They'd work on a song for a while and then regroup with Costey to figure out elements to expand or elaborate. \"These guys have a chemistry that's existed for a long time, and that chemistry can't be ignored,\" says Costey. \"When you have a band that can play as well as they can play with each other, having them jam together in real time can actually be the quickest way to try a bunch of ideas and get them on tape.\" Songs such as the instantly memorable \"Good Help (Is So Hard To Find),\" the warm and vulnerable \"Little Wanderer\" and the brooding lead single \"Black Sun\" were all tracked with the four members of the band playing together in a room, reacting to each other in real time, adding layers \u2014 and later subtracting some. \"All four of us being on the floor together in the studio was something that hadn't happened in years, because Chris was always behind the glass or in the control room,\" says McGerr. \"But this was more like when we're onstage, where everyone has their eyes closed and we're playing in the moment. With 'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive,' it turned into a twenty-minute thing they captured in the control room on a two-track. We had started it in Seattle months prior and it just wasn't getting there. Rich brought us into the control room and was like, 'This is our song.'\"\nCostey credits another element of their production set-up with helping achieve the perfect balance of their classic approach and the new one: \"My studio has one big live recording space and two control rooms,\" he says. \"Once we got basic tracks together, Chris would work on them in the other control room. And he would end up doing completely different versions of the songs. For 'Black Sun,' Chris did all this super old school sequenced synth stuff that we used on the final track, and it really brought that song to another level.\"\n\"Black Sun\" is also a perfect example of Gibbard's customarily honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. \"'Black Sun' is about divorce and the ugliness and conflicting emotions that come with that: anger, sadness, finger-pointing, acceptance, forgiveness, understanding. To me, the idea of a black sun has multiple meanings: The black sun could be an eclipse, where one thing eclipses another. The sun is supposed to be a radiating light on the world but in this instance it is blacked out. We've all been that at some point in our life when we're supposed to be shining upon someone giving them support, but for some reason are unable to do that. I am the black sun, and the song is as much an indictment of myself as anything.\"\nAlthough, in the case of \"Black Sun,\" Gibbard says he's willing to elaborate on the elements of the song that are autobiographical, he's never been one to reveal the precise meaning behind his lyrics. \"I know that people will assume these songs are about certain things, and in some instances they are going to be correct,\" he says. \"But I'm not going to give people a road map.\"\nGibbard acknowledges that, early on in the process of writing this group of songs, as he was still trying to make sense of the major changes happening in his life, he had to remind himself not to change his creative process. \"If there's a reason people can relate to my songwriting, maybe it's they feel like they're getting an honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. I'm certainly not going to censor that just because people think they know something about my personal life. I would be cowardly as a songwriter and not be true to what I've always done if I shy away from these events in my life because I was in relationship with a public figure.\n\"I know the lyrics aren't 100% fiction and they're not 100% nonfiction, and only Ben knows what that blend is,\" says Harmer. \"But with this group of songs, I do think he is writing from a genuinely vulnerable and honest place and I'm proud of him for putting himself out there and being fearless about it.\"\nOne of the songs on Kintsugi that Gibbard says he holds closest to his heart is \"Little Wanderer,\" where he sings, \"You sent a photo out of your window of Paris of what you wished that I could see. But someone's gotta be the lighthouse and that someone's gotta be me.\" He explains: \"There are innumerable songs about, like, 'The road ain't no place to start a family.' 'Home Sweet Home' by Motley Crue, 'Gone Til November,' by Wyclef Jean, and so on. But nobody ever writes a song about sitting at home, waiting for someone to come back. And for so much of my life, I've been the one off somewhere in the world trying to maintain a connection through digital portals. Now, being with someone who travels pretty much all the time, I feel like I've gotten a taste of my own medicine. All the songs are personal, but that one is personal in a way that is very tender to me.\"\nHere, too, \"The Ghosts of Beverly Drive\" encapsulates important elements of the album's larger theme \u2014 embracing flaws and being open to change. \"If only you had known me before the accident,\" it begins, \"for with that grand collision came a grave consequence.\" Says Gibbard: \"There's this charade you play with someone when you start seeing each other, that no one has ever made you feel this way before,\" says Gibbard. \"'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive' is about when you say to the person you're with, 'Let's just acknowledge that we are not the first people to feel this way. Let's be honest with each other that we've been in love before or that we've fallen out of love with people before, and that's OK.'\"", "otherInfo": "Hey everyone,\n\nFor this Thursday\u2019s 4pm PT Live From Home show, I'll be playing an all-Beatles cover set!\n\nThis week\u2019s livestream is in benefit of Seattle-based non-profit Amara, who help serve children in foster care and the families who care for them.

Growing up surrounded by the sounds of the South and the powerful timeless music emanating from Muscle Shoals, The Secret Sisters were heavily influenced by a range of uniquely American musical styles, including country, bluegrass and gospel, as well as classic rock and pop. They were raised on a rich tapestry of music, listening to everything from George Jones and Loretta Lynn, to The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, The Ramones, Fiona Apple and Rufus Wainwright. Their debut album was soon lauded by critics and adored by their rapidly growing legion of fans. The stage was set for the sisters to advance as artists and further establish themselves as songwriters, which they proved to do on their sophomore album, Put Your Needle Down, an eclectic mix of musical styles and sounds rooted in storytelling. Luckily the duo had a powerhouse producer, T Bone Burnett, to help them on their first two albums. \u201cWe became friends with T Bone early on in our career and he\u2019s been an amazing guide,\u201d said Lydia.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss.

From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band.

With a hook that\u2019s a mile wide, it chronicles the lives, loves, and friendships that sustain us. Said lead singer Zack Kibodeaux, \u201cWe wrote this as a band, and we wanted to tap into the feeling of that special friendship where you know you can count on one another.

He has been on the road since 2013, performing more than one thousand shows across the United States. His live performances draw from his own discography as well as an extensive collection of folk, bluegrass, and gospel songs and select tracks from his favorite classic and contemporary songwriters. The necessity of travelling and performing solo has informed the development of Ryan\u2019s musical and songwriting style. Jordan Lawrence, writer for Free Times in Columbia SC called his arrangements \u201cdelicate but sweeping, making for a remarkably cohesive collection littered with stunners that rival many of indie folk\u2019s biggest names.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in South Carolina, Hutchens had been exposed from an early age to southern appalachian traditional music in the bluegrass, folk, and gospel genres as well as to styles ranging from classical orchestral to Nat King Cole to Nirvana. Family members played guitar and banjo and Ryan picked up guitar in his early teens but didn\u2019t consider it a serious calling for another decade. In 2010 Ryan began experimenting with songwriting and self recording, focusing on sparse guitar and vocal tracks combined with keyboards and synthesizers. In 2011, he became a founding artist of the newly formed Post Echo Media Label and started crafting a plethora of songs under his Grandfather\u2019s surname turned band name, \u201cCancellieri\u201d. As years passed and his musical experiences and interests grew, Ryan found that the honest root of what he wanted to do with music was best found in live performances and better executed with more traditional instrumentation.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2015, Hutchens released six albums under the Cancellieri name. Early Spring released in 2011; Bad Hands released in 2012; III released in 2013; Welcome To Mount Pleasant released in 2014; Closet Songs: A Collection Of Demos And Covers released in 2014; 46 And Raleigh released in 2015. Generally speaking, each album saw Hutchens progressing further away from his electronic and experimental musical beginnings, and closer to what he was doing at his live performances. The last two of these albums (Closet Songs and 46 And Raleigh) include original music but are predominantly based around Ryan\u2019s live performance covers of American traditional, gospel, bluegrass, and folk songs. In January of 2016, Ryan dropped the \u201cCancellieri\u201d moniker in favor of his real name. The name change facilitated his career shift from bedroom electronic song sculptor to touring singer songwriter and live performer. As part of this transition, a \u201cbest of\u201d album was released in September 2016 under the name Ryan Hutchens. This album is fittingly called Collection and features previously recorded and newly remastered tracks from the 2013 album III and the 2014 album Welcome To Mount Pleasant. Ryan followed up that release with his second original album, The Last Ten Years. The Last Ten Years was recorded at Archer Avenue Studio in Columbia South Carolina during the Summer of 2017 and independently released on October 13, 2017. Five years after beginning his never ending tour, he looks forward to continuing to create new music and to bringing his live performances to people around the world.", "otherInfo": "Ryan Hutchens will perform a live concert from his basement studio in Denver Colorado on Thursday May 7!

Timeless and timely, it's a classic sound with every word sang from the heart, driven forward by a mix of southern storytelling, Bible Belt twang, and Owens' big, booming baritone.\n\nFresh out of the studio, Owens has just finished recording his latest album due to release at year\u2019s end. He traveled to Texas for this project to record in The Panhandle House Studio enlisting the talents of JT Corenflos | Electric Guitar ( Alan Jackson, George Jones, Charley Pride, George Strait), Mitchell Smithey | Steele Guitar (Ray Price, Lee Ann Rimes, TG Sheppard, Gary Stuart), Dale Morris Jr. | Fiddle (Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Ray Price, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt), Kerry Huckaba | Bass Guitar (The Hansons, The White River Band), Jay Brown | Piano (Canyon, Ty Herndon), and Andrew Raley | Drums (Deryl Dodd). Together, they captured a sound filled with fiddle, pedal steel and all the hallmarks of classic country music. Ten of the eleven tracks are penned by veteran writer Galen Griffin (Luke Bryan, Joe Diffie, Craig Morgan, Clay Walker) and magically Engineered and Produced by Nick \u201cAce\u201d Lutz (David Alan Coe, Ty Herndon, Little Texas, Ronnie Milsap, Kellie Pickler). This is an album filled with music intended to take the listener back to an earlier era in Country Music reminiscent of a simpler time. Owens shines brightly delivering each song with the same supersized voice that once shook the pews of his hometown church as the musicians expertly lay the sounds of Dance Halls long gone.\n\nLong before he hand-built his career in the honky-tonks and country clubs of the southeast, Owens grew up in rural Alabama. In many ways, it was a classic American upbringing, filled with family, faith, and music. Owens shines a light on those old-school values with his debut album Where I\u2019m Coming From and his newest release It\u2019s A Southern Thing, working closely with a roster of country music's top songwriters \u2014 including Bob Diperio, Greg Barnhill, Tony Stampley, Wynn Varble, Brian Callihan and Trent Willmon \u2014 for his most upbeat collection of songs to date.\n\n\"Like a lot of my favorite country singers, I grew up singing Gospel music,\" says Owens, who grew up listening to artists like Randy Travis and Keith Whitley. \"I grew up the same way, and I've stayed true to my Traditional Country roots. I'm still singing about going to church, eating fried chicken, and keeping it country. Why wouldn't I? Once you start trying to be something you're not, that's when you lose track of where you're headed.\"\n\nLongtime country music journalist Robert K. Oermann agrees, pointing to Owens' traditional approach as his strongest weapon. \"I like to think that there are cycles in [country] music,\" Oermann explains. \"Usually, the pendulum swings out and the Pop-Country people bring in a whole lot of new listeners, and then the new listeners discover real Country music. Then there's usually a swing back to more traditional styles. I hope we're on the cusp of that\u2026 and if we are, Shane is perfectly positioned.\"\nA self-made road warrior who was recently named \"Independent Artist of the Year\" by MusicRow Reveals 2018 Country Breakout Awards, Owens continues to maintain an active schedule of listening room and honky tonk shows along with festival appearances. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut in 2017. He also appeared at summertime events like CMA Music Festival and Jamboree In the Hills, both of which were voted as the top two American country music festivals of the year. Cracker Barrel has picked Owens' music to appear in several of the store's exclusive releases, including Country Faith America and Country Faith Love Songs, while Netflix included his song \"Country Never Goes Out of Style\" in the popular series The Ranch. No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it. And I'm nowhere near done doing it.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hello Shark LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/baby-tv-presents-orindal-records-streaming-showcase-extravaganza-tickets-103961096438"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LOLO LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9076346.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From Jackson, TN, LOLO is a show-stopping singer who has \"so much music flowing through [her] that it fills two people\" (Associated Press).

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

Having built a substantial grass-roots fan base through tireless touring and old-fashioned hard work, McConnell is primed for a mainstream breakthrough.\n\nSean McConnell demonstrates exactly why McConnell has already won such a devoted audience. He writes vivid, forthright, effortlessly catchy songs whose incisive melodic craft is matched by their resonant emotional insight. Such instantly memorable tunes as \u201cHoly Days,\u201d \u201cBeautiful Rose,\u201d \u201cBottom of the Sea\u201d and \u201cBest We\u2019ve Ever Been\u201d are both catchy and personally charged, conveying an unmistakable sense of personal experience while exploring universal truths.\n\n\u201cThis record\u2019s a bit of a step for me,\u201d McConnell asserts. \u201cIt\u2019s a real storyteller record, and it\u2019s pretty autobiographical. I\u2019m learning how to be more honest and understated in my writing, and I wanted to match that sonically and vocally. When I look at this collection of songs, I see a lot of nostalgia, and looking back on sacred moments. I\u2019m kind of nostalgic and reflective by nature.\u201d\n\nMcConnell recorded the album in his adopted hometown of Nashville with producers Jason Lehning and Ian Fitchuk, who also contributed keyboards and drums, respectively. The recording took place prior to McConnell signing with Rounder, with the artist financing the sessions himself.\n\n\u201cThis project started,\u201d he explains, \u201cwhen I went to a cabin by myself for a week, with the intention of writing some songs. In that week, I wrote about half of the songs on the record, and I could see the thread of what this record was gonna be. That was exciting for me, because it normally takes me a year to find an album\u2019s worth of songs that belong together. The whole recording process was really fun and liberating, and the energy in the studio was really positive.\u201d\n\nSongwriting and music-making have been a part of Sean McConnell\u2019s life for as long as he can remember. \u201cMy mom was a singer and my dad was a guitar player and songwriter,\u201d he notes. \u201cThey\u2019d play in coffeehouses and I\u2019d go along and watch them perform, and seeing that lifestyle showed me that music was an option. And seeing my dad painstakingly writing songs had a huge influence on me, and gave me license to feel like I could enter into that world.\u201d\n\nBy the age of ten, he had become proficient on guitar and was writing his first songs. \u201cI fell in love with the instrument first,\u201d McConnell recalls. \u201cLearning guitar gave me a feeling of uncharted territory laid out in front of me. And as I got better on guitar, the songs started to come naturally. At around the same time, we moved from Massachusetts to Georgia, and the first song I wrote was about the feeling of leaving the familiar and feeling lost in a new place. Music gave me a focus and became an emotional outlet for me.\u201d\n\nHis supportive family background helped to instill the confidence and drive to pursue his muse early on. \u201cI started playing in middle school, doing any gig I could get just to get my chops up,\u201d he says. \u201cBy high school, I would be doing local gigs and really promoting them, bringing out a couple hundred kids to my shows a few times a month and starting to make a decent living at it. That made me think that maybe I could do this in other towns. So I started traveling around the southeast a little bit, and there was always enough progress to take things to the next level.

The Georgia native has lived a life that truly reflects his art \u2013 troubled to some, enviable to many and yet remarkable to most anyone who hears the soft-spoken musician recount it.\n\nFowler admits that his diehard, all-or-nothing approach to life has sometimes been both a blessing and a curse. But lately, it\u2019s all been a blessing. That wasn\u2019t the case at the start of his musical journey.\n\nLiving a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle eventually caused the artist to hit rock bottom. \u201cAt rock bottom,\u201d Jason says, \u201cThat's where I began recovering from a place of hopelessness.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt is also where I discovered that it was not God who left me, but I who left Him.\u201d He went from a rising star with a lucrative record contract, to being addicted and homeless on the streets of Atlanta, to finding redemption through Grace \u2013 and now he shares that story through his music.\n\nFowler grew up in a musical family and notes, \u201cMy dad sings like Pavarotti, my Uncle Mike taught me guitar, and my Uncle Chris has a doctorate in musical performance. Some of my earliest memories were at my granny\u2019s house, with everyone singing and dancing to \u201cPony Boy\u201d by The Allman Brothers Band.\n\nWhen Fowler was sixteen he heard a friend playing Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d on guitar. This sparked his musical fire and Jason bought his first guitar. Shortly after his dad offered him a new guitar if he learned to play \u201cJessica,\u201d also by The Allman Brothers Band.\n\n\u201cI think my dad was hoping I would give him a couple of weeks,\u201d Fowler smiles, \u201cbut I went and played it for him that night.\u201d\n\nFowler honed his talents for music and writing as a teen. By his twenties he was working on several projects and ultimately landed a record deal with his band Ultraphonic. They were produced by Bryan Holmes (The Producers) and, coincidentally, Johnny Sandlin, who produced The Allman Brothers Band, Widespread Panic and Wet Willie. Fowler and his band spent several months recording with the legendary \u201cSwampers\u201d at MS Sound in Muscle Shoals, Alabama \u2013 just like the song.\n\nThen the unthinkable happened\u2026\n\nThe record label was bought out by Microsoft and the album was shelved. What seemed to be the pinnacle of a life long-held dream, ended up a nightmare of epic proportions. After the breakup of the label, band, and dreams of stardom, Fowler landed a solo deal with Mil Cannon at Imagemil in Atlanta (Usher, Whitney Houston, Carrie Underwood). Fowler was given another chance. With expectations high, Fowler was on his way back, but still carrying his old hurts, habits, and hangups, fueled by drugs and alcohol. By this time Jason didn\u2019t know how to live a sober life, which affected his personal and professional relationships. His tenure at Imagemil didn\u2019t last very long. Mil and members of the Imagemil team confronted Fowler with the facts: he was out of control and needed help. They had to let him go.\n\nFowler was stubborn and his substance abuse issues did not go away quietly. Over time, he spiraled, ending up homeless and alone. After being kicked out of a drug dealer\u2019s house, Fowler finally waved the white flag of surrender.\n\nBroken, lost, and hopeless, Fowler entered a Christian-based rehab in Athens, Georgia, called The Healing Place. He stayed there for an entire year, but it was in that facility where the fog eventually lifted and Fowler rededicated his life to Jesus. \u201cIt\u2019s like a country song backwards,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI started getting things back in my life instead of losing them. I had lost, my relationship with God, my family, my friends, and myself.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t a sad ending. This was simply the end of his old life, and a new beginning of Fowler\u2019s career as a Christian artist, a worship leader and a speaker.\n\nFowler\u2019s debut solo album, Letters from the Inside (Black Cat Records, 2014), was produced by Jason Hoard (Third Day, Mac Powell, Jamie Grace, Natalie Grant). Musically it tells his journey back from homelessness, addiction, and hopelessness. It took almost five years for Fowler to clear his head and his musical passion to return.\n\n\u201cI was becoming more involved in church and in my recovery. I started feeling like my reason for being here is to praise God,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cBut I also needed to share my story of where I was, what happened, and what it\u2019s like today.\u201d\n\nThe songs from Letters from the Inside were snapshots of Fowler\u2019s journey and newfound faith. The ten songs were recorded in Griffin, Georgia over a period of two months. Fowler recruited long time friend and drummer Shane Evans, formerly of Collective Soul, as the backbone of the album and his touring band. The two began to share the message of hope and redemption, mostly to young people and up-and-coming musicians who were about to embark on their own journeys.\n\nI Fall In (Rcity Records, 2016) is Fowler\u2019s second album, which took Fowler on a sojourn to Nashville. It was there where he recorded at Dark Horse Studios with Grammy-nominated producer Billy Smiley (White Heart, Johnny Cash, Bebe and Cece Winans). Together they recruited a heavy-hitter list of talented artists for his sophomore effort, which included Leigh Nash (Sixpence None the Richer), Will Turpin (Collective Soul), Peter Furler (Newsboys), Steve Brewster (Chicago, Bob Seger, Amy Grant), Anthony Sallee (Michael W. Smith, White Heart), Jillian Edwards, Blair Masters (Casting Crowns, Garth Brooks, Mercy Me), and Jared Kneale (Kacey Musgrave, Ben Rector), and even his aunt, Joy Waters Fowler, to name just a few. The album also provided an opportunity for Fowler to mend his relationship with Imagemil founder Mil Cannon, who directed Fowler in three music videos.\n\nThe Nashville adventure also led to a professional collaboration with legendary vocalist John Schlitt (Petra, Head East) and Billy Smiley (Whiteheart) to form The Union of Sinners and Saints in 2016. They followed up their 12-song debut album with a nationwide tour of churches and venues, singing, sharing their testimonies and witnessing to fellow Christians about their fame, follies and fellowship.\n\nJason also shares his writing and performing talents with Will Turpin of Collective Soul on his latest release Serengeti Drivers (Gooey Records, 2018). The two collaborated on five songs and will tour the southeast behind the album, which took four years to complete.\n\nFowler is currently working with Dove winning and Grammy nominated producers Ian Eskelin and Barry Weeks (Francesca Battistelli, 7eventh Time Down), putting the final touches on his third solo album earmarked for an early 2019 release.\n\nIn between recording projects, Fowler tours the United States and Canada, sharing his story of rock, recovery and redemption.", "otherInfo": "Hey Family!\nLooking forward to playing some more tunes and hanging out with you!\nSee ya soon!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Justin Trawick LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7196522.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Justin Trawick and The Common Good\u2019s debut record, \u201cThe Riverwash EP\u201d, exemplifies the raw emotional live sound Trawick and the band have cultivated over the years playing in clubs and festivals up and down the East Coast.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Phil Smith LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10369051.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "New York City, New York", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\ud83d\udcfa\ud83c\udfb5 Going live tonight at 8PM!\n\nSet a reminder here: https://www.facebook.com/philsmithny/posts/2777204495735980"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ross Ellis LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8794749.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ross Ellis was born and raised in the small town of Monterey, Louisiana (pop 439).

From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fire in the Radio LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10292340.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Emo, Punk, Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There are occasions where a band reaches beyond its humble beginnings and insular scene and creates a cohesive set of memorable songs that wield the potential to make a more seismic and lasting impression.

Infectious rhythms. Smoky vocals. KALO is groovesome rhythm and blues meets fiery rock 'n' roll.\n\nIsraeli guitarist, singer and songwriter Bat-Or Kalo fronts her eponymous trio and also travels and tours the U.S. and Israel solo (wearing only her last name and her vintage Gibson electric guitar). Fiery, unbridled and electrifying, KALO\u2019s guitar chops and contralto voice belie her small frame with a sound like Howlin' Wolf or Muddy Waters on steroids.\n\nWithin the past two years, KALO has opened for Los Angeles-based rocker Andy Frasco, the godfather of British blues, John Mayall, guitar phenom Chris Duarte and others. KALO has shared billing with acts like Avett Brothers, Robert Randolph & the Family Band and many more.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, KALO released the funky, guitar- and rhythm-laced studio album, Wild Change to much acclaim. It was fresh on the heels of Live in NYC, recorded at the renowned The Bitter End music club in New York City and released in late 2016.\n\nBased in the Midwest for the past three years as she zigzags the country, KALO\u2019s roots run deep and trace back to her home an ocean away in Israel. A cassette tape of Jimi Hendrix\u2019s Are You Experienced set KALO on a musical path when she was 16 years old. In 2009, that path stretched across the Atlantic when KALO left Israel to soak herself in American music, the sounds of Hendrix, Jim Morrison, John Lee Hooker, Nina Simone and Elvis calling.\n\nAfter completing her classical and jazz guitar studies in Oklahoma, she briefly returned home to record her jazz-imbued Flesh & Bones in Tel-Aviv. Afterward, KALO moved to New York to hone her skills as a live performer, frequenting stages like The Bitter End, Arlene\u2019s Grocery, Rockwood Music Hall and others.\n\nIn 2012, KALO left The Big Apple to strum her guitar and write in the heart of Dixie. Her sophomore album took root in the Mississippi Delta and other southern states, where the blues tinge of Dear John began to grow. Released in 2013, the album received much critical acclaim from media around the world.\n\nOver the next several years, KALO developed a loyal following with fevered stage shows and raw energy. Brandishing a unique and genre-bending interpretation of the blues and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, everything about KALO is unexpected \u2026 and infectious.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit Show Box, Seattle"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Happy Fits LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10325173.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fencing champion Ross Monteith and orchestra nerd Calvin Langman didn't exactly get along in high school.

Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant. The song Ginger Ale and Lorna Doones is a masterpiece, a hard hitting gut punch on every level- voice, melody, words, performance, instrumentation. I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jah Movement LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9035860.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Reggae, Afro-beat, Dancehall, R&b, Soca, Hip Hop", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Since the launch of the Reggae band Jah Movement in May 2015, they took over the Florida Circuit in less than a year and won the hearts of many fans young and old.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cordovas LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9577041.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Joe Firstman, Toby Weaver, Lucca Soria, Sevans Henderson", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rooted in triple-stacked harmonies, southern storytelling, and cosmic country twang, Cordovas create their own version of American roots-rock with That Santa Fe Channel.\n\nThe album marks the band's ATO Records debut, arriving after more than a half-decade's worth of international touring, communal living, and shared songwriting sessions. It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "Live from Cordovas HQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Roots LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8653218.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Roots, also known as The Legendary Roots Crew, The Square Roots and The Foundation, are an influential, Grammy winning hip hop group based out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, famed for a heavily jazzy sound and live instrumentation. Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Most clear in my memory, even amid the party that a live music backstage scene can tend to be, Will was the happiest guy in the place \u2013 clearly exactly where he wanted to be, and loving every second. This was a contagious vibe from the outset, one that Will had no trouble channeling into music that rings in the heart of the listener, and a live show as inspiring as it is entertaining. Between two acclaimed and successful albums, 2012\u2019s Rose Queen and 2015\u2019s Ringling Road, and what now clocks in at a near-decade's worth of dogged road work, William Clark Green has established himself as one of the most important voices of his genre - a voice that now pipes up again on his anticipated new album, Hebert Island.\n\nTexas is a big place, complete with fully distinct sub-territories - we reserve the right to bust into several states, should that become strategically expedient - and our traveling musical artists tend to become experts on the rich mosaic that makes up Texas' cultural geography. Will has found himself onstage in a growing portion of her 254 counties, and has called several his home; as he puts it, \"I kinda spend six years everywhere\". Childhood northeast in Tyler, high school years in College Station, college years at Texas Tech in Lubbock, early music career years in the north-central hamlet of Eastland, and lately his most urban digs so far, in Fort Worth - but deep down, Will's Cajun roots call to him incessantly, and thus southeast Texas is never far from his mind. The new album is named for Will's retreat at Hebert Island (say \"AY-Bear\", though you'll occasionally hear \"HEE-Bert\") near Beaumont, and refers to the hilltop upon which his camphouse sits - not an actual island, but a potential one, should the occasional flood come to pass; high ground is valuable in this landscape. Will considers himself a \"half-ass coon-ass\" - a distantly-descended Cajun, but one who holds a deep appreciation for that history and that way of life. \"It's a real place\", Will insists, with the feeling that only such a beloved space can foster - his family has owned it since 1869, in the early years of Reconstruction, and is where they established one of the state's first rice farming operations. It's a place that echoes through time for William Clark Green, connecting his family's past and tradition to who he is as an artist, and as a man, today.\n\nIt's been over three years since Ringling Road. \"I'm not gonna force songs,\" Will sighs. \"We could have finished the record a long time ago, but we didn't like the mixes - we're the bosses, and we don't have to listen to ourselves.\" The pressures and deadlines of the professional recording artist are nothing new, and while he certainly notices that pressure, Will recognizes it to be a good problem to have. \"I remember when no one gave a shit, so yeah, it's incredible to have that want-to. So far, every record I've come out with has been my best record - I wrote my ass off for this one. I wanted to make sure it beat Ringling Road, and I'm not bragging on myself - I just knew it was going to take effort.\"\n\nThat effort has paid off; Hebert Island is a stellar new batch of songs from a guy who has gone to great lengths to keep his energy focused, through all distraction, on quality songcraft. \"My favorite songwriter is Guy Clark - the songwriter's songwriter. It's what I've always cared about the most...the craft of songs is really where it's at for me. I think good songs are undeniable.\" Mostly recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium with Benjy Davis at the board, the new album also features players who have been backing Will for near the full ride, including guitarist Steven Marcus and bassist Cameron Moreland. \u201cGoner\u201d stands as a shimmering, no-hard-feelings take on the moment of breakup, the protagonist of the quasi-travelogue \u201cStay\u201d understands that it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, as long as you\u2019re close to love, and the ballad \u201cShe Loves Horses\u201d exemplifies both the warmth and strength that\u2019s developed in Will\u2019s songwriting and the performance power of his players.\n\nWill's desired contribution to the world is songs that change lives for the better, and he realizes that he's conduit as much as creator for that change. And in spite of - or, perhaps, because of - the demands and pressures of the life he's chosen, and the position of leadership he's earned through a decade of determination, William Clark Green is a guy who takes none of this for granted. \"Our path is guided by something that's greater than me, I believe that.

After he and his wife moved to San Francisco he landed a job as a A&R man at OM records, where in addition to reviewing demos for the label he also submitted his own material, which would pay off big time for him. In 2001 he went from behind the desk to behind the turntables and the recording studio as an artist in his own right. In 2003 Kaskade released his first album, \"It's You It's Me\", which was well received by critics.\n\nIt would be his follow up, \"In The Moment\" in 2004, that would put Kaskade on the map.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sammy Rae Music LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8845198.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.sammyrae.com", "otherInfo": "Talking anything and all things music with Sammy Rae & Jack Weppler (of SRC).

It's easy to see why she's caught the ear of greats like legendary Lubbock, Texas fiddler Tommy Hancock (widely regarded as the godfather of West Texas music), who was quoted as saying of Leigh's work; \"It's great to hear music that affects you on an intellectual level as well as makes you want to dance\".\n\nAll musical and performing prowess aside, the thing Leigh has become most famous for is her whip-smart songwriting. Her songs have been recorded by country music legend Lee Ann Womack, Sunny Sweeney, Charley Crockett, Whitney Rose, Austin's The Carper Family, and Norway's Liv Marit Wervik, among others. Leigh has collaborated with songwriting greats such as Jim Lauderdale, Rodney Crowell, John Scott Sherrill, Robbie Fulks, Charlie Louvin and David Olney. On the critically acclaimed duet album Holdin' Our Own (2008), Leigh sang duets penned with country rockabilly giant Jesse Dayton. In 2013 Leigh released the Gurf Morlix produced Before The World Was Made with her frequent songwriting and touring partner Noel McKay. In 2015, Leigh appeared on Don't Forget Me Little Darling, Remembering the Carter Family, along with fiddler Jenee Fleenor (Blake Shelton) and guitarist Brandon Rickman (Lonesome River Band). Leigh was a core member of country bluegrass band High Plains Jamboree from 2015 to 2017, also featuring guitarist Noel McKay and bassist and banjo player Simon Flory. Rolling Stone called the band \"One of the Best Things We Saw at AmericanaFest.\"\n\nLeigh is two time Texas Music Awards Best Female Vocalist, 2018 Ameripolitan Music Honky Tonk Award winner, appeared as a finalist on USA Network's Nashville Star in 2003, and most notably, was champion of the 1993 Vergas Loon Calling Contest as a child in her home state of Minnesota.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Spooky Mansion ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8607644.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Surf Soul Rock N Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fun and relaxing music", "otherInfo": "Noise Pop & Wild Little Thing Slightly Sour Ale Present NO PLACE LIKE HOME,\nA Livestream Benefit Series for the Bay Area Music community."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rogue Wave ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8479770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rogue Wave is an alternative rock band signed to Jack Johnson's label Brushfire Records (they released 2 previous albums with Sub Pop).

It's a note-to-self that he more than lives up to on the EP, bringing together the heartfelt vulnerability of Ryan Adams and the arena-ready anthems of Eric Church into an infectious, genre-blurring masterpiece. The tracks showcase Cartwright's considerable growth, both as a writer and performer, while honing in on the sharp lyrics and soulful delivery that earned his self-titled debut widespread praise in Texas and beyond. The Dallas Observer called that record \"one of the very best of 2015,\" while the Fort Worth Star Telegram raved that \"there\u2019s an ease and a polish\u2026belying Cartwright\u2019s relative youth,\" and Red Dirt Nation said that it \"stirs what makes us all feel young and poignantly reminds us how fragile we all are when it comes to love, heartbreak and home.\" For Cartwright, though, it was only just the prelude.\n\n\"You never know what you don't know,\" he reflects from his newly adopted hometown of Nashville. \"I'm very proud of that first record and some of those songs have done very well for me, but with a whole additional year-and-a-half of hard touring and writing under my belt when we recorded 'Don't Fade,' I felt like I had a much better idea of how I wanted to sound and who I was as an artist.\"\n\nCartwright grew up in a conservative Texas home where his exposure to modern music was limited primarily to the 'Forrest Gump' soundtrack and Steven Curtis Chapman records. For his twelfth birthday, his parents gave him an acoustic guitar, and suddenly the entire world opened up. He discovered singer-songwriters and alt-country troubadours, contemporaries like Pete Yorn and classic artists like John Prine. It led him to begin penning his own songs, and by the time he hit high school, he was playing regularly in bars and churches. A summer program at NYU exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nCartwright worked his way through school with odd jobs in the music industry and wedding band gigs, and while they paid the bills, they left him unsatisfied and more convinced than ever that he needed to take the leap with his own music. He moved back to Texas and recorded an EP, 'Bull Run,' that earned him top honors in the B.W. Stevenson Songwriting Competition. A performance with John Fullbright led Cartwright to Oklahoma, where he collaborated with producer Wes Sharon on the self-titled debut that would break him onto the Texas radio charts.\n\nThroughout it all, Cartwright was a hustler to his core, playing 100+ shows per year without an agent or a manager, working harder than he ever had before in his life but moving closer towards his goals every day. The quality of the music and the exhilarating live performances were turning heads throughout the south, and that's when Cartwright caught the ear of fellow Texas songwriter Rob Baird, who offered to produce 'Don't Fade' with Brian Douglas Phillips at Phillips\u2019 Austin-based Rattle Trap Studio.\n\n\"We spent three or four days in total at Rob's house before we went into the studio because I had between 30-50 songs that I had written,\" remembers Cartwright. \"Rob and I went through each of them and pared the list down to figure out what made for a cohesive collection and what kind of sound we wanted to go after.\"\n\nThe sound that they ultimately landed on is instantly appealing, a warm, radio-friendly blend that calls to mind everything from Will Hoge to The Old 97's. Earworm opener \"Never Coming Back\" is an ideal showcase for Cartwright's gifts, with his silky-smooth vocals riding a laid-back drum groove punctuated by dynamic electric guitar riffs and classic rock organ swells.\n\n\"That was one of the first co-writes I ever did in Nashville,\" says Cartwright. \"I wrote it with Ty Graham, who had actually been my next door neighbor at Berklee during my freshman year. We always used to talk about girls and relationships in college, and when we sat down to write this song, the story was something we'd both experienced in our personal lives, so it came together really naturally.\"\n\nCartwright takes a darker turn on \"Busted,\" a driving, gritty tune inspired by the breakdown of a truck in the west Texas heat that mirrored the breakdown of his own crumbling relationship, while \"Nobody But You\" channels the pain of staying behind while a loved one leaves, and the sweetly emotional \"Don't Fade\" battles the inevitable passage of time. One of the most special moments for Cartwright, though, comes at the end of the EP, as the stripped-down acoustic meditation of \"Arkansas\" drifts off into an ethereal soundscape like the last rays of light at sunset.\n\n\"That ending was a very specific idea that came to me on a camping trip with my roommate,\" remembers Cartwright. \"We were spending the days and nights out in the middle of nowhere just listening to the crickets chirp and trying to figure out life, and I wanted to recreate that feeling.\"\n\nThe ability to capture such intimate, meaningful moments is the magic of Cartwright's songwriting. These are tunes about coming and going, uncertainty and change, finding yourself and what you're willing to sacrifice for your dreams. There are no dramatic revelations here, just the steadily deepening understanding of self that comes with maturing. Cartwright renders the sound of growing up beautifully and in vivid detail, capturing the anxiety and the ecstasy in all its messy, human glory. For a kid who grew up worshipping songwriters, to craft such exceptional music is to truly live the dream, and with another full length album on the way, it's safe to say Troy Cartwright's years are going to just keep getting bigger and bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dustin Bentall ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8267801.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Country, Alternative Country, Americana, Folk", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A singer songwriter from Vancouver, BC, Dustin Bentall's debut album, Street's With No Lights, is a strong album full of heartache, river parties and great tunes.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/barneybentall"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Niki Kennedy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10024935.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-Songwriter based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.", "otherInfo": "Niki Kennedy will be livestreaming a selection of favourite chill pop covers and original music on Sessions Live."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alice Howe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9118397.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Folk, Blues, Americana", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With her soulful, impeccably tuned voice and crafted poetry, Boston\u2019s Alice Howe is \u201cat once of the moment and timeless, personal and universal\u201d (Americana UK).

What's more, it's a story told by two artists whose individual careers are years deep. They both boast a string of acclaimed records and command large audiences nationally, but Hold My Beer grew out of the pair's decade-long, house-packing acoustic tour they started doing just for the fun of it. \"It became obvious to us that we should write the story of our friendship,\" explains Bowen, \"How we met, how we became friends.\" That story began 15 years ago, when Rogers dropped by one of Bowen's gigs. \"I invited him back to the house \u2013 nicknamed \u2018the White House\u2019 \u2014 to jam,\" Rogers explains. \"The house sat on a big lot so we never worried about our music waking the neighbors. We usually had a keg tapped and staying up all night playing music was a regular thing. Anyway, the next thing you know, we're here, 15 years later.\" That sense of camaraderie and personal history comes through in each of Hold My Beer's ten songs. Musically, the songs are rich and layered \u2013 big, oaky acoustic guitars, swooping fiddles and lap steel that chuckles at every punchline; that's no surprise, given that the album was produced by the legendary Lloyd Maines. \"Lloyd's not only one of the most talented people on the planet, he might be one of the funniest, too,\" says Rogers. \"He's a genius. He's smart, and he knows how to make each musician play in order to be the best version of themselves.\" That \"best version\" comes through again and again on Hold My Beer. In the rollicking album-opener \"In the Next Life,\" Bowen and Rogers outline the story of their lives together, from that first meeting at Wade\u2019s show in San Marcos to the stage of the Grand Ole Opry. They acknowledge every peak and valley along the way before concluding, \"I guess that what they say is true, all you need is one good friend/ and in the next life, we wanna be ourselves again.\" Of that unique chemistry, Bowen explains, \"We don't have to flip the 'entertainer' switch. We flip the 'friendship' switch. That\u2019s what 'In the Next Life\u2019 is about \u2013 how we became friends, and how that outshines everything else.\" -more- \"'Til it Does\u2019 opens with a bright, swaying guitar line and Bowen's warm voice sighing, \"I never told her that I loved her, but I do.\" From there, it settles slowly and sadly into its wistful, indelible chorus. \"The first time I heard it we were playing one of our acoustic shows together,\" Rogers recalls. \"He played it, and by the time the second chorus came around, I knew the words and I was singing along. I looked at him when it was finished and said, \"Did you write that? That's a damn good song. We gotta cut that.\" Like so many songs on Hold My Beer, \"'Til It Does\" is a showcase for the pair's deft and savvy skill as writers. They're able to summon strong, evocative images that convey deep meaning \u2013 avoiding clich\u00e9 without ever sounding forced or labored. The songs go down smooth and smoky, like finely-aged whiskey. They're also defined by a natural mood of exuberance. In the riled-up, boot-stomping \"Lady Bug,\" they arc their voices up high over galloping banjo, pleading \"Lady bug, lady bug, give me some good luck/ four-leaf clover, come on over.\" \"That was a real hard song to pull off, because I had a different vision for it than Randy did,\" Bowen says. \"We kinda battled over how the song should go. Then we went out, started drinking vodka and beers, took a few shots \u2013everybody just relaxed \u2013 and came back in the studio and did it in one take.\" Even the album's choice of cover songs \u2013 Willie Nelson & Merle Haggard's 1983 hit \"Reasons to Quit,\" Haggard's 1978 song \"It's Been a Great Afternoon\" and Joe Ely's roaring \"Hopes Up High\" \u2013 are effortlessly made over in Rogers and Bowen's images, and feel as much a part of their story as their originals. \"'Reasons to Quit' really sums us up,\" Rogers says. \"We play so many dates, we're gone so much from our families, the excesses of the road, the toll it takes on our bodies\u2026 We tried to sit down and write that song, and we realized, 'Fuck it \u2013 they already wrote it.'\" The song provides the perfect conclusion to the record. As fiddle saws slowly in the background, Bowen and Rogers itemize all of the hardships of being on the road and working as a touring musician, before defiantly concluding \u2013 as Nelson and Haggard did all those years ago \u2013 \"The reasons to quit don't outnumber all the reasons why.\" It's a proud declaration from two men who have weathered a lot, but are still looking for the next party, and still ready to provide its soundtrack.", "otherInfo": "THE COUNTDOWN IS ON...\n\nGrab yourself a cold one, get ready to dance in your living room and help us celebrate the new album 'Quarantine Style'.\n\nJoin us Thursday night for a special kind of album release concert that we filmed for you guys at Cheatham Street Warehouse followed by a live Q&A to answer your questions leading up to the release at midnight (11CST)!\n\nPre-order the album here: https://bstlnk.to/HoldMyBeerVol2"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lisa Sanders ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9006623.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Fok, Country, Alternative, Blues", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born in Philadelphia Pennsylvania Lisa Sanders began singing on the street corner at an early age with her older brother Ty.

Formed in 2015 out of high school, the band has spread their sound far and wide from triathlon finish lines and waiting outside of dives to nationwide tours and sold out shows at home. The band released their debut album \u201cCamp Poppa\u201d at the turn of 2017 and is released their sophomore album \u201cYup\u201d in November 2019.

The Macks currently reside in Eugene, Oregon.\n\n\"The [Yup] album consistently delivers on its experimental take through ever-changing guitar licks and fascinating drum patterns.

The album constantly develops, leaving the listener constantly entertained of the unsuspecting vocal inflections and instrumental development.\" - Daily Emerald\n\n\u201cTheir angsty attitude is masterfully translated from the vibes of a house show into a recorded album. Even though you\u2019re just hearing their songs, the imagery of what you know their performances are like immediately comes to mind.

With guitar solos that absolutely shred, quick-witted lyrics executed with articulate ease, and a whole lot of technical skill, this band brings the house down every time. In relation to their songwriting process, Guitarist Windheim explains, \u201cSongwriting for us is a lot like putting a puzzle together\u201d. He translates by telling me \u201cA lot of our songs are a combination of riffs from myself, Josef and Sam and then we ambitiously smash 'em together.\u201d Their 2017 debut album Camp Poppa contains elements from all across the spectrum expertly crafted together to produce a sound unique to them. Off this album, blues undertones reveal themselves in \u201cTemple\u201d and jam elements take over in \u201cThe Joe Frog Jam\u201d giving listeners a whole spectrum of sound to take in. Their latest work Yup released in 2019 takes their sound to a whole other level with the perfect blend of DIY and professional elements. Regarding DIY elements, The Macks have held true to their roots keeping their work completely homespun by producing all music, videos, and even tours themselves. \u201cIt's a huge part of us.\u201d Windheim points out. \u201cTo do all those things the way we want to, it takes time and commitment more than equipment and money\u201d he goes on to explain.

Los Inicios\n\nBohemia Suburbana se form\u00f3 en la ciudad de Guatemala en marzo de 1992. La banda fue fundada por los guatemaltecos Juancarlos Barrios como guitarrista, Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n como vocalista, el colombiano Juan Lu\u00eds Lopera (Piolly) en el bajo y Jos\u00e9 Pedro Mollinedo en la bater\u00eda (Pepe).\n\nA esfuerzo de conciertos y bajo su propio auspicio en 1993 Bohemia Suburbana public\u00f3 su primera producci\u00f3n musical titulada Sombras en el Jard\u00edn. La misma se edit\u00f3 bajo el sello de Primera Generaci\u00f3n Records.\n\nEn \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum se encuentran las primeras versiones de los temas \u201cEn el Jard\u00edn\u201d, \u201cPeces e Iguanas\u201d , \u201cYo Te V\u00ed\u201d y cinco temas m\u00e1s; el original editado en cassette contiene \u00fanicamente ocho canciones.\n\nEn 1994 se integra a Bohemia el peruano Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez en los teclados y guitarra. Ese mismo a\u00f1o Primera Generaci\u00f3n Records en vista a la creciente demanda, decidi\u00f3 publicar una versi\u00f3n de Sombras en el Jard\u00edn en formato de disco compacto. En esta nueva edici\u00f3n se incluyeron dos nuevos temas \u201cDios es ajeno\u201d y \u201cDel-fin\u201d.\n\nBohemia planificaba sus apariciones en vivo en forma totalmente l\u00f3gica y emp\u00edrica debido a la ausencia de una escena de eventos y compa\u00f1\u00edas de producci\u00f3n que se encargaran de velar por \u00e9ste trabajo.\n\nNo obstante la aceptaci\u00f3n y poder de convocatoria de la banda fue creciendo en forma exponencial, siendo una sorpresa para lo o\u00eddos conservadores de la \u00e9poca y un reto para nuevos patrocinadores interesados en promover sus marcas y conceptos.\n\n2. Mas all\u00e1 de las fronteras\n\nEn 1995 los bohemios suburbanos viajaron a la ciudad norteamericana de Miami, Florida, para grabar y producir su siguiente placa discogr\u00e1fica. Auspiciados bajo el sello disquero RadioVox grabaron los temas que conformaron su segundo \u00e1lbum titulado Mil palabras con sus dientes.\n\nCon \u00e9sta producci\u00f3n tuvieron la oportunidad de exponerse y debutar m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las fronteras centroamericanas. La canci\u00f3n \u201cPeces e iguanas\u201d logr\u00f3 posicionarse como una de las favoritas en muchas estaciones de radio y lleg\u00f3 a sonar en lugares que la banda jam\u00e1s pens\u00f3. As\u00ed Bohemia se vio inmersa en una intensa faena de giras y presentaciones en Guatemala, Centroam\u00e9rica, Puerto rico y otras ciudades dentro de los Estados Unidos. Por motivos personales en 1996 Alex Lobos releva las baquetas a otros bater\u00edas invitados por la banda.\n\nSe podr\u00eda decir a ojo de espectador que en 1997 Bohemia Suburbana se encontraba en un \u00e1pice de su carrera. Sus discos parec\u00edan venderse bien, la demanda por la banda en los escenarios era cada vez m\u00e1s grande. Sin embargo Bohemia sucumbi\u00f3 ante una crisis producto de la falta de orientaci\u00f3n y escaso apoyo recibido por parte de los sellos discogr\u00e1ficos; Bohemia deja los escenarios y sus integrantes toman caminos separados.\n\nEl distanciamiento de la banda se prolong\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os, y en 1999 los bohemios decidieron reunirse para realizar un concierto de reencuentro. Al mismo tiempo, bajo el t\u00edtulo de los Remixes y la emergencia de las circunstancia, RadioVox decidi\u00f3 publicar un disco donde se incluyeron versiones electr\u00f3nicas de las canciones conocidas de Bohemia. Estas versiones fueron remezcladas por Juancarlos Barrios durante el receso de la banda.\n\nEl concierto de reencuentro se realiz\u00f3 en la vieja Plaza de Toros en la ciudad de Guatemala y para sorpresa del grupo y los organizadores el evento rompi\u00f3 record de asistencia superando por mucho las expectativas previstas. Esto motiv\u00f3 de nuevo a los bohemios a seguir adelante y se proyectaron producir un nuevo disco.\n\nCon las ganancias del concierto decidieron retirarse una temporada a Madrid, Espa\u00f1a, con el fin de convivir de nuevo como banda y adentrarse en los estilos musicales que flu\u00edan por esos lugares. En \u00e9ste proceso Juancarlos decidi\u00f3 dejar el grupo y los bohemios acordaron reagruparse en Guatemala para seguir adelante con el proyecto.\n\n3. Cierre del milenio\n\nAs\u00ed naci\u00f3 el disco que se public\u00f3 en el 2001 con el titulo de Sub, producido por ellos mismos y bajo el auspicio del sello discogr\u00e1fico Pir\u00e1mide sound/Premier producciones.\n\nEn el escenario Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez contin\u00faa en guitarra y se integra a la banda el guatemalteco Rudy Bethancourt ejecutando los teclados y guitarras. Asimismo el colombiano Alejandro Duque (ex-Aterciopelados) se suma a la alineaci\u00f3n en los tambores.\nLos noventas fueron a\u00f1os de renovaci\u00f3n en el rock latino y por ende se dieron nuevos intereses para los productores y promotores de la m\u00fasica. Bohemia rearmada y renovada inici\u00f3 un nuevo despegue captando de a pocos la atenci\u00f3n de sus antiguos seguidores y llamando la atenci\u00f3n de nuevos adeptos. Realizaron cont\u00ednuas presentaciones en Guatemala y reiteradas incursiones a escenarios centroamericanos y estadounidenses. Esta vez con el respaldo de su disquera, los bohemios produjeron el video clip filmado para la canci\u00f3n El grito.\n\nEn marzo del 2002 la banda cumple diez a\u00f1os de existencia y para celebrarlo el quinteto realiz\u00f3 una serie de conciertos. Estas presentaciones fueron grabadas y varios de los temas fueron agrupados en un disco que publicaron en el 2003 con el t\u00edtulo Aqu\u00ed diez a\u00f1os\u2026en vivo bajo los sellos Strip Records y DLN distribution. A este disco se incluyeron nuevas versiones de estudio de los temas \u201cEn el jard\u00edn\u201d y \u201cBolsas de t\u00e9\u201d canci\u00f3n de la cual adem\u00e1s realizaron un video clip, filmado y producido en la ciudad de Nueva York.\n\nPor desdicha fue la pirater\u00eda la que acapar\u00f3 las ventas de los discos dejando a la compa\u00f1\u00eda flaca e impotente para mantener el proyecto y elevarlo a una mayor escala. Bohemia sigui\u00f3 tocando en Guatemala de forma constante, pero a inicios del 2004 se encontraron ante una crisis similar a la del 97; la banda decidi\u00f3 hacer receso para que as\u00ed cada uno de sus integrantes tuviera tiempo de estabilizar su vida personal.\n\n4. Sonido hom\u00f3nimo\n\nEn este lapso Lopera y Bethancourt decidieron mudarse a la ciudad de Miami, FL. Por su parte Rodriguez viaja a California, Duque a Colombia y Pinz\u00f3n se queda en Guatemala.\n\nEn mayo del 2007 con el soporte de una productora guatemalteca y el apoyo de viejos amigos de la banda los bohemios se reunen en la ciudad de Miami. Tras unos meses de convivencia como banda desarrollan nuevos temas, luego se disponen a grabarlos y a estudiar las posibilidades de lanzar un nuevo \u00e1lbum al mercado.\nA inicios del 2008 Bohemia realiza una serie de conciertos y presentaciones de fogueo en la isla de Puerto Rico. Despu\u00e9s de eso la banda decidi\u00f3 guardarse y enfocarse en la producci\u00f3n musical de su cuarto \u00e1lbum al que titularon simplemente Bohemia Suburbana. El mismo fu\u00e9 lanzado en formato digital y m\u00f3vil en Estados Unidos y Latinoam\u00e9rica en Enero del 2010 bajo una iniciativa de distribuci\u00f3n y promoci\u00f3n a cargo Warner Chappell y Warner Music latinoam\u00e9rica; \u00e9ste disco obtuvo la nominaci\u00f3n al premio Grammy latino en la categor\u00eda de mejor \u00e1lbum de rock a\u00f1o 2010.\n\nEsta nueva producci\u00f3n representa un giro en el estilo que ven\u00eda siguiendo la banda en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Buscando un sonido m\u00e1s fresco Bohemia Suburbana vuelve con nuevos aires promoviendo temas como \u201cSerenidad\u201d, \u201cQuiero Decir\u201d y \u201dSobrevolar\u201d retomando de \u00e9sta forma los escenarios de Estados Unidos, Puerto Rico y Centroam\u00e9rica.\n\n5. BS20 El inicio de un nuevo ciclo\n\nEn septiembre del 2012 bohemia cierra un ciclo importante de 20 a\u00f1os de fundaci\u00f3n para lo cu\u00e1l convoca a todos los integrantes que circularon por la banda en alg\u00fan \u00e1lbum o gira. La celebraci\u00f3n se produce en 3 fechas consecutivas presentando un espect\u00e1culo compilatorio de su repertorio en las ciudades m\u00e1s importantes de su pa\u00eds natal.\n\nEl grupo se re\u00fane en el lago de Atitl\u00e1n a ensayar y montar un show sin precedentes recopilando los temas m\u00e1s representativos a lo largo de toda la trayectoria musical de la banda; la afluencia total a la celebraci\u00f3n del BS20 suma alrededor de las 25,000 personas. Paralelamente Juan Luis Lopera bajista fundador del grupo notifica su retiro de la banda acompa\u00f1ado de un abandono t\u00e1cito por parte de Rudy Bethancourt.\n\nActualmente la banda cuenta con los siguientes integrantes, los cu\u00e1les representan un 80% de la alineaci\u00f3n original:\n\nGiovanni Pinz\u00f3n (voz), Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez (guitarra y teclados), Juan Carlos Barrios (guitarra), Josu\u00e9 Garc\u00eda (bajo) y Jose Pedro Mollinedo (bater\u00eda).\n\nEntre el 2013 y 2014 la banda comenz\u00f3 a componer nuevas canciones para una nueva producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica. En septiembre del 2014 Bohemia empieza la grabaci\u00f3n de su quinto \u00e1lbum de estudio en la ciudad de Guatemala bajo la producci\u00f3n de Phil Vinall, conocido productor musical de bandas como Zo\u00e9, Placebo, Pulp y Radiohead. El nuevo disco fue mezclado por Phil Vinall y Manny Calder\u00f3n (Hello Seahorse, Enjambre, Bunbury) en diciembre 2014 en los estudios de Sonic Ranch, Texas y masterizado por Harris Newman en Grey Market Mastering, Montreal, Canad\u00e1.\n\nEl 26 de febrero de 2015, la banda lanza de forma sorpresiva a trav\u00e9s de sus redes sociales, el primer sencillo del nuevo \u00e1lbum: \"Tengo Que Llegar\". Se registran m\u00e1s de 8000 descargas la primera semana y el single aparece en el n\u00famero uno de ventas de iTunes Guatemala.\n\nEl 16 de abril de 2015, Bohemia publica Imaginaria Sonora, en formato digital y f\u00edsico. Ese mismo d\u00eda, Imaginaria Sonora se convierte en Trending Topic y aparece en el n\u00famero uno de los charts de iTunes Guatemala. El quinto \u00e1lbum de la banda contiene 12 canciones: Tengo que llegar, La Quimera, Mapa universal, Mal sabor, Perplejo, Ayai Uyui, Pero nadie, Paso al r\u00edo, D\u00eda de los muertos, Xibalb\u00e1, Irreversible sistema y Buscando conexi\u00f3n.9\n\nImaginaria Sonora es un viaje a las ra\u00edces de la banda y un salto hacia el futuro. El resultado es, seg\u00fan Pinz\u00f3n: Una propuesta ecl\u00e9ctica, esencialmente rocanrolera. Una versi\u00f3n actualizada de Bohemia. La nueva placa asume influencias del rock cl\u00e1sico e incorpora sonidos espaciales, anal\u00f3gicos, electr\u00f3nicos logrando una propuesta madura fresca y bailable. La l\u00edrica social de Pinz\u00f3n, la cr\u00edtica humanista y la poes\u00eda a ratos introspectiva y rom\u00e1ntica se empapa de la esencia volc\u00e1nica de Guatemala, acompa\u00f1a al migrante que atraviesa el desierto y al que vive las tradiciones latinoamericanas.10\n\nCon este nuevo \u00e1lbum la banda se adentra con m\u00e1s vehemencia al rock m\u00e1s energ\u00e9tico salpicado de electr\u00f3nica y por qu\u00e9 no decirlo, de experimentaci\u00f3n con elementos retro. Imaginaria sonora es precisamente la banda sonora (por ratos impredecible) de una pel\u00edcula que derrocha imaginaci\u00f3n. Y donde de nuevo, la banda vuelve a divertirse. Aqu\u00ed yacen canciones singulares y con gancho. Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n, cantante, resulta m\u00e1s terrenal y cuyo aporte a todo el conjunto de la obra es decisivo incluso en la ideolog\u00eda que acompa\u00f1a a la banda.11\n\nEl 1 de mayo de 2015, Bohemia se presenta en el expocenter de Tikal Futura para presentar: Imaginaria Sonora en vivo. Desde ya algunos medios de comunicaci\u00f3n destacan la renovaci\u00f3n de la banda y colocan la nueva producci\u00f3n como uno de los mejores discos de su carrera.12\n\nEn el a\u00f1o 2014, Bohemia Suburbana, conformada por Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n (voces), Josu\u00e9 Garc\u00eda (bajo), Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez (teclado), Juancarlos Barrios (guitarra) y Jos\u00e9 Pedro Mollinedo (bater\u00eda) se re\u00fanen para crear colectivamente su quinto disco de estudio. Consiguen la atenci\u00f3n del prestigioso productor Phil Vinall quien viaja a Guatemala para la grabaci\u00f3n de algunas canciones y luego van durante unas semanas a los estudios de Sonic Ranch en Texas para los \u00faltimos arreglos de Imaginaria Sonora.\n\nEn el 2015, lanzan los sencillos con v\u00eddeo: \"Tengo Que Llegar\" y \"Mal Sabor\", los cuales les permitieron ingresar a la rotaci\u00f3n de importantes cadenas de televisi\u00f3n y radio como MTV, asimismo, recibieron los reconocimientos de \"Mejor Canci\u00f3n\", \"Mejor V\u00eddeo\", \"Mejor Concierto\" y \"Mejor Concierto\" en los Premios 2015 del Circo del Rock en Guatemala. Ahora se encuentran en el lanzamiento de su nuevo sencillo y video \"Pero Nadie\" y lo que ser\u00e1 su Gira 2016 como pre\u00e1mbulo a la celebraci\u00f3n del 25 Aniversario de la banda en el 2017. 13\n\nGira Estados Unidos 2016\nA mediados de agosto del 2016 Bohemia Suburbana inicia una gira por California.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st.

Over the last couple of years, the man originally turned on to the dance by Derrick Carter has fomented his own groove driven, emotive brand of house that now resonates around the world. Turning heads right from the off were his compilations on Deep Down and Defected, which found Sonny adding his remix flair to a bunch of classics, and after that came sophomore effort After Parties & Aeroplanes. Again a collaborative affair featuring the likes of Doorly, Gene Farris and Cajmere, it was a more jacking, sharp-edged treat designed for maximum dance floor impact, but was also stuffed with unforgettable vocals that agin saw Sonny stepping up his game.\n\n2016 saw the already influential artist stepping up yet again, this time by making his brilliant entry into the hallowed Defected In the House series. His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Selena Faider ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "offaiah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8893725.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "House, Tech House, Techno", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "BOOKINGS:\nAMERICA: hamilton.wright@unitedtalent.com\nROW: ben@radiusartists.com\n\nMANAGEMENT:\nCircle Eight Management\nmicky@circleeightmgmt.com\n\nStill waters run deep, but OFFAIAH prefers to keep it that way.\nAfter growing up in East London, he did a little revitalizing\nhimself in tandem with the growth of his town that was\nthreatened to crumble under neglect and rubble.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label.

Soon he had gain all the experience necessary when it came to employing the latest production techniques, something he is now famed for.\n\nHis hard work turned fruitful when he was seventeen as he entered for two major Hungarian remix competitions and as a result Sunny Lax the artist was born on the progressional circuit through the publishing of these mixes. His first success came in the year of 2005 after he sent his new track \u201dPUMA\u201d to one of the infamous dance labels Anjunabeats. The trio that are Above & Beyond were so taken back by his demo that they play the record for weeks on end (and didn\u2019t waste any time signing him up).

From ups to downs (and the unthinkable in between), the Tampa, FL alternative rock outfit has weathered last-minute label shifts, lineup changes, and everything else that the industry can possibly throw at a diligent, dynamic, and dedicated group of musicians. In over a decade on the scene, they\u2019ve delivered five full-length albums to a diehard fan base, culminating on 2012\u2019s 15th & Hope--the last record to be produced by the legendary Phil Ramone--enjoyed multiple television and film syncs, performed on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d and played alongside everybody from Maroon 5 and Scott Weiland to Plain White T\u2019s. However, in 2014, vocalist and guitarist Don Miggs experienced something of a personal revelation that would inform his next musical step.\n\n\u201cI realized that, in some ways, I was making music to fill a hole so people could tell me I\u2019m great or chase some sort of mythical thing that somebody else deems a hit,\u201d he admits. \u201cI decided I was done doing that. You can\u2019t guarantee making anybody else happy, so you might as well make yourself happy.

However, he\u2019s bringing out his most powerful statement yet in 2015 with MIGGS.\n\n\u201cDammit, I care a lot,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cI want people to listen and feel like there\u2019s a melody, and it matters.

Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in 1968, when he was asked to replace former frontman and guitarist Syd Barrett. Barrett was becoming increasingly difficult to work with (partly due to substance abuse), so Gilmour stepped in to fill the void. Gilmour's contributions helped to define what would become known as the \"Pink Floyd\" sound. With Roger Waters, Gilmour co-wrote many of Pink Floyd's classic songs, including \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", \"Wish You Were Here\", \"Time\", \"Dogs\", \"Echoes\", \"Comfortably Numb\", and \"Run Like Hell\". When Waters left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career, Gilmour took over Pink Floyd as leader, and they released two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994). Both albums performed very well, proving that the Pink Floyd name was stronger than any individual member. On July 2, 2005, David Gilmour and Roger Waters briefly set aside their differences and performed as Pink Floyd for one final performance at Live 8. The reunion was the most talked about event of the day, and sales of Pink Floyd's back catalogue shot through the roof. Rumors of a full scale tour began to surface shortly after the show, with both Gilmour and Waters being offered millions of dollars, but it wasn't meant to be. Neither Waters nor Gilmour showed much enthusiam to work together again, with Gilmour being quoted as saying that he would rather spend his time pursuing his solo career.\n\nDavid Gilmour has released 3 \"official\" solo albums (although there are numerous bootlegs of live recordings); David Gilmour (1978), About Face (1984), and On An Island (2006).\n\nThis last album, \"On An Island\" is for sale with a limited edition including a DVD which you can see live&session videos of Gilmour.", "otherInfo": "David Gilmour Live at Pompeii Broadcast Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAmOdxZKWjY"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Chico ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aakanksha Sharma ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Leonel Garc\u00eda ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6038695.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Latin Pop, Pop, Alternative, Latin", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Para m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n visita www.leonelgarcia.com Leonel Garcia.

Born with a membrane between her and the rest of the world, yet still very much connected to and dependent on a larger life force. It\u2019s this origin story that inspired the name of Squirrel Flower\u2019s new album I Was Born Swimming.\n\nWilliams comes from a deep-rooted musical family tree. Her grandparents were classical musicians who lived in the Gate Hill Co-op, an artistic cooperative from upstate New York that grew out of Black Mountain College. Ella\u2019s father, Jesse Williams, spent most of his life as a touring jazz and blues performer and educator, and lends his bass playing to the album (listen for his smooth solo on \u201cHeadlights\u201d). Growing up in a family of hard working musicians fostered a love of music and started Williams down her own musical path. As a child, Williams adopted the alter ego of Squirrel Flower. A couple years later, she began singing with the Boston Children\u2019s Chorus while studying music theory and teaching herself to play the guitar. As a teen, she discovered the Boston DIY and folk music scenes and began writing, recording, and performing her own songs, now returning to the name Squirrel Flower as her chosen moniker. By the time Williams had begun performing live, recording and touring she was already well on her way to the signature artful songcraft heard on the album.\n\nSquirrel Flower\u2019s music is ethereal and warm, gushing with emotional depth that the listener can step into like a warm bath. The band on I Was Born Swimming plays with delicate intention, keeping the arrangements natural and light. The album was tracked live, with few overdubs, at The Rare Book Room Studio in New York City with producer Gabe Wax (Adrienne Lenker, Palehound, Cass McCombs). The musicians were selected by Wax and folded themselves into the songs effortlessly. At the heart of the album lives Williams\u2019 massive, haunted vibrating voice and melancholic, soulful guitar playing. The sounds expand and contract over diverse moods, cutting loose on the heavier riffs of \u201cRed Shoulder\u201d or \u201cStreetlight Blues,\u201d both recorded in her hometown of Boston, and holding back with atmospheric restraint on \u201cSeasonal Affective Disorder\u201d or \u201cBelly Of The City\u201d.\n\nI Was Born Swimming begins with an Iowa drive down I-80 and continues to travel, poetically, between her college town of Grinnell Iowa, Boston, MA and New York City where the album was recorded. Throughout the 12 songs, landscapes change and relationships shift, \u201cThere\u2019s so much in the record about movement and stagnation. Feeling stuck, needing to move, needing to stay still, swimming, falling, running, growing, etc etc.\u201d said Williams. The album\u2019s lyrics feel like effortless expressions of exactly the way it feels to change \u2014 abstract, sad and hopeful.\n\nWilliams eventually returns to the image of her in the sac; born swimming, knowing how to exist, love herself, and not needing anyone else to do it for her.\n\nBorn swimming in blue water\nDidn\u2019t ever need another\nNow I live underwater.\nHeat\u2019s rising\nCan you see it shimmer?\nI\u2019m spinning\nCan you see me shimmer?\nI\u2019m moving faster than it\nCan you see me shimmer?\nSo dip me in the water.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "David Falcone Acoustic Guitar ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9773930.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"David Falcone is a wonderful guitarist whose playing equals and often surpasses many better-known fingerstyle artists.

Very rarely though, do we see this happen in a live environment.\n\nSince 2005, John Rotellini has captivated audiences around the world by doing the impossible. A childhood love for magic paired with an eclectic collection of interests led John to develop what has become an obsession. By merging sleight of hand magic and illusions with other disciplines - psychology, con artistry, film, music and theatre, John has created live, interactive events that more closely resemble Hollywood blockbusters rather than traditional magic shows. No longer is the world of the impossible limited to the silver screen.\n\nJohn now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada where he can be found performing select dates in some of the Strip's most critically acclaimed productions and entertaining some of today's hottest stars when not on his own U.S. Tours.\n\nWhether it be performing live in front of thousands, entertaining small groups or executing death-defying large scale stunts, John's performances will be sure to leave you speechless. After all, how often do you get to live the impossible?\n\n\nHistory:\n\nWhen it comes to his shows, John has a very unique way of thinking. Rather than using a traditional audience/performer relationship, John has developed interactive experiences where the audience become the stars of the show. This allows each show to be different than the last and makes for many off-the-cuff and unique moments between John and his volunteers.\n\nAfter several years of honing his craft and performing for people in his home state of Wyoming, John launched his first headlining tour, Locked UP in April of 2009. The show, which opened to sold out crowds included a very special stunt. The spectacle, Rotellini's first venture into stunt work, was entitled -B L I N D- and required John to spend a day without sight, wrapping up with a blind drive through the streets of his hometown in a 2009 Pontiac Solstice roadster.\n\nThree years later, in January of 2012, the show transitioned from it's original Locked UP format into the TOURPOCALYPSE brand. The show, a blend of high-octane illusions punctuated with close up effects, celebrity cameos and what can only be called \"special\" theatrical moments, entertained crowds across the U.S. and led to John's first full-length DVD - John Rotellini: TOURPOCALYPSE Live From The Gryphon Theatre.\n\nFrom late 2011 until early 2013 John spent most of his time on the road. After his critically-acclaimed tour wrapped its run during the middle of 2013, John began developing an all-new show - AGENT PROVOCATOUR which began in 2015 and is currently touring the United States.\n\nOn April 19, 2016, John became the first magician to perform at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV. John joined the Harlem Globetrotters (who were also completing another first for the arena - its first athletic event) to create some very special magic for their 90th Anniversary World Tour.\n\nCurrently, John keeps very busy, raising thousands of dollars for charities that include Kidd's Kids, Children's Miracle Network, Win-Win Entertainment, The USO and Relay for Life while traveling the country entertaining audiences at various colleges, public and private events to rave reviews. He has been fortunate enough to gain sponsorship from Countryman Microphones, American Crew Men's Products and has had the privilege of having EXPRESS Fashion be the official wardrobe provider for some of his tours.", "otherInfo": "Special Win-Win Entertainment Virtual Visit and performance for patients, staff and visiting families of Dignity Health Hospital Campuses in Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Paul Carella ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8418065.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Blues, Country Blues, Rock, Americana", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Paul is an international and multi award winning singer/songwriter.

But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude.

Though like almost all love stories, this one is not without its complications. Offering wistful rumination on how mental health can send shockwaves through even the most intimate and entwined of relationships, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 sees Karima strike a masterful balance of meditative and melancholy songwriting.\n\n\u201cIn a world where we sometimes feel we can\u2019t speak out, we tend to take it the worst out on people closest to us.\u201d says Karima, opening-up about the track\u2019s fragile subject matter.\nRelocating from the shores of the Irish Sea to the expansive horizons of the Pacific last year, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 was one of a number of new songs penned in Venice Beach, California, as the singer found herself instinctively drawn to the sun and sounds radiating from the West Coast and its simmering alternative scene. Finding a kindred spirit in LA producer Tim Carr (who also produced her sublime \u2018Shelf Life\u2019 track of last year), the textured and transient feel of \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 is testament to the stimulating new environs Karima found herself writing in.\n\u201cI was fantasising about making more, organic, saturated sounding records for a long time and alongside this, I wanted to record out in America as I was finding most of my musical influences were artists from America.\u201d she says. \u201cLast year I made the move to go out to California to find the sound for the new record and to immerse myself in the West Coast indie/alternative scene and out there, the relationship with Tim bloomed and the music was made.\u201d\n\nDusky of atmosphere and mellifluous of melody, the record also features appearances from close friend Simon Edwards on Bass (who notably played on Talk Talk\u2019s seminal \u2019Spirit of Eden\u2019 record; a favourite of Karima\u2019s), plus London-based singer/songwriter Klara from Sweden who feathers the record with its ethereal omnichord layerings.\n\nProduced by Tim Carr, the track was further mastered by Grammy-nominated Phillip Shaw Bova (Andy Shauf, Father John Misty).\n\n\u2018Orange Rose\u2019 arrives with a captivating video filmed in Las Vegas just before Christmas last year. \u201cI had the idea about a concept of self-destructive behaviour\u201d she says, \u201ca constant running away from our fears which potentially ends in us running away from the people who can make us whole again.\u201d Subtle of narrative and cinematic in quality, the video finds Karima lost deep in thought and caught-up between a rock and a hard place in the Nevada state city. Karima Francis is a critically acclaimed musician and songwriter, renowned for her innate ability to blend haunting melodies with honest lyrics and alluring ambiance. With an ear for music evident from an early age, Karima went on to release her debut album \u2018The Author\u2019 in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. Her consequent album\u2019s \u2018The Remedy\u2019 (2012) and \u2018Black\u2019 (2016) witnessed further acknowledgment of her artistic abilities and saw her truly begin to spread her wings. Her journey to date has found her playing on Later\u2026 With Jools Holland, supporting the likes of Paul Simon, Amy Winehouse and The Stereophonics, as well as working with renowned producer Flood (Nine Inch Nails, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Depeche Mode). Entering her thirties, Karima found a new rhythm to recording life on the West Coast of the USA last year.

Armed with strong original material and a top notch band, SaraBeth has garnered a very large, loyal following that continues to grow every day. SaraBeth doesn\u2019t want to take all the credit for her passion for music. She maintains that her family plays an essential role in her story, citing them as the source for a lot of her motivation. \u201cMy younger brother was drafted to play pro baseball for the Cardinals, my dad recently wrote a book on motivation and inspires people all over the world, and my mom is the glue that holds us all together. With all these incredibly successful and driven role models in my life, I thought, how can I NOT go after this dream?\u201d After crossing over into Nashville territory, SaraBeth began collaborating with some of the best, most respected songwriters in Music City, sparking her love for songwriting. Her sophomore single \u201cMiss You Anywhere,\u201d is one of her original songs, and she hopes to continue writing more in the future. \u201cEach song I've recorded was selected based on the lyrics and message,\u201d says SaraBeth. \u201cI want those who listen to my songs to walk away uplifted and encouraged. Life is too short to be negative!\u201d Being born and raised in the Texas music scene, SaraBeth knows country music.

During a bad patch in his life, when he\u2019d lost his woman, was stuck in a dead end job, and down on his luck, he decided to make a change. Leaving everything behind, he took to the road on a musical pilgrimage around America that would come to define his sound and himself. Picking up an old guitar in a pawn shop along the way he found gigs from town to town playing his way across the states in the tradition of the delta Bluesmen before him.\n\nThen while stumbling home drunk one night along the main drag of Nashville, he came across a crowd. The crowd were surrounding an old man playing a one string guitar made from a broom handle and a box, while playing drums with his feet. In that moment Ben new he had found the inspiration he was looking for. But it wasn\u2019t until he made his way to New Orleans that he managed to get his hands on such an instrument.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

Playing guitar, bass, keyboard, and turntables, MING toured the world and gave international audiences an introduction to electronic music, opening up for acts like Sting, RUN-DMC, and Moby.\nOver the last decade, MING has pulled the studio more into focus, while still keeping a hand in the touring life. He remixed singles for a star-studded lineup including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, and Black Eyed Peas. His original tracks climbed the charts, scoring four Top 40 trap remixes on Beatport.

Her debut single \"You've Got That Something\" was released in Sweden in 1995. Later the same year, her Swedish breakthrough came with the single \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\". It was slightly less successful in the USA in its 1997 release. These singles became part of the album Robyn Is Here.\n\nRobyn had her North American breakthrough in 1997 when the singles \"Show Me Love\" and \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\" were released. These singles ended up on the Billboard top 10, and both made #2 in Canada. She followed those two singles with the slightly less successful \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\", which was the lead-off single for the 1995 Swedish release. It was ineligible for the Billboard Hot 100 at the time since it was not released as a retail single in the U.S., but did reach #32 on the Hot 100's Airplay chart, and #6 in Canada. The album offered the standard version and a remix causing the album to be re-released with this remix on it.\n\nHer following album My Truth was released in May 17, 1999, but not in the US (though it was promised to be) because her American record company RCA didn't think the album contained any potential hits. The album won rave reviews and is referred to by fans as her best album to date, even garnering her a Grammy (as did Robyn is Here both in the US and Sweden).\n\nIn 2000, Povel Ramel gave her the Karamelodiktstipendiet; a scholarship for her musical achievements where most of the reward lies in the prestige and honor, not the money.\n\nIn 2001, she contributed the song Say You'll Walk The Distance (written by J\u00f6rgen Elofsson) to the soundtrack On The Line.\n\nIn November 2002, she changed labels (from RCA to JIVE) and released the album Don't Stop The Music in Sweden. This album was also promised a US release after a few minor changes were made to it. These changes were never made and it has yet to see an American release. The title track was later covered by Swedish girl group Play, and album track \"Keep This Fire Burning\" was a single for British soul singer Beverley Knight.\n\nIn May 2004, the CD Robyn's Best was released by BMG. It is a shortened version of her first album and contains no material from her other two albums that had been previously released. It is considered by fans to be a poor attempt by her past record label to pass the album off as a greatest hits album.\n\nIn 2005, Robyn released her new single \"Be Mine\", and a month later the album titled Robyn. This music was released by Konichiwa Records, a record label she started in 2004 for the sole purpose of releasing her music. Konichiwa (Misspelling of Japanese 'Konnichi wa', which means \"Hello\") is a reference to the phrase \"Konichiwa bitches!\" by the comedian Dave Chappelle. It is also the name of a rap song in the end of her self-titled album, which is considered to be a little controversial for this young pop singer. The album entered at No. 1 on Swedish charts on May 5th, 2005.\n\nIn December 2006, Robyn released The Rakamonie EP in the UK as a preview to her more recent material. This was followed by the release of \"Konichiwa Bitches\" in March 2007. The revised edition of Robyn was released in the UK on April 2, 2007. The UK release contained new tracks \"With Every Heartbeat\" and \"Cobrastyle\" (a cover of a 2006 single by Swedish rockers Teddybears) alongside two slightly altered versions of the original songs.\n\nThe second single from the UK release was the Kleerup collaboration \"With Every Heartbeat\" which reached number 1 in the singles chart in the UK on August 12, 2007.\n\nShe is also present in EA GAMES \" Fifa 08\" with the song \"Bum Like you\".", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AWOLNATION ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9609563.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie, Indie Rock, Alternative, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "AWOLNATION crafted one of the most influential songs in years with the chart-topping, record-breaking track 'Sail.'

Deciding then to form an urban soul trio \u201cShana\u201d the three moved to Johannesburg to make their way.\n\nKeeping \u201cSimply Hot And Naturally African\u201d (the meaning of \u201cShana\u201d) together as an ongoing project, the three also pursued their individual visions, collaborating on the way. Black Coffee was chosen as one of two South African participants in the Red Bull Music Academy in 2003 jump-starting him into the South African DJ scene - a decision he says he has never looked back on. His first big break was when his song \u201cHappiness\u201d was featured on the \u201cDJs At Work\u201d album.\n\n2005, the same year as the release of Black Coffee\u2019s powerful debut album \u201cBlack Coffee\u201d saw the birth and formation of Soulistic Music, Black Coffee\u2019s wholly owned 360\u00b0 corporate structure, his team\u2019s home base and the jump-off point for himself, and as time has evidenced for many others too. Black Coffee revealed that his first album was created using very basic music-making software. \u201cI don't know how to explain the production stages of my album because all I did was put down the basic ideas that I had, I didn't use any MIDI controllers everything was played with a computer mouse. He added that the use of live instruments in a song is also very important, giving a track that final magic touch and bringing it to life.\n\nA view through the Black Coffee \u2018lens\u2019, at the end of 2011, confirms a delightful, fresh and truly heart warming vista of dynamic and exciting creative production, glimpses of a genius unfolding and degree\u2019s of difficulty, challenge and hardship. To many Black Coffee has led the \u2018house music\u2019 way.. establishing since a global pre-eminence in vocal house music and a business approach structured to unlock the plethora of opportunities offered by a converged digital realm driven by the songs and their performance.\n\nReserved, studiously academic, inventive, imaginative, quiet, enigmatic, shy and bold are but of the few ways in which many across the world perceive Black Coffee. No matter how he is seen he remains one of the very few club DJs in the country who genuinely understands the precise function of a music disc jockey: he does not simply mix songs, he re-interprets their previously unimagined musical possibilities, adapting and arranging as each work advises and so quietly creating new works that give life. When he debuted his interpretation of Hugh Masekela\u2019s rambunctious jazz hit \u201cStimela\u201d (2005 original South African release, 2008 UK release), Black Coffee simply demonstrated how it was possible to rework the South African canon music vault into club music, creating works that were acceptable to both the young and the old, a feat not easily achievable. It has required a decidedly original-inclined, singular mind such as this to be able to pursue this kind of music trajectory and the gold and platinum awards since are testimony to his resolve .\n\n2007 brought another powerful Black Coffee release \u201cHave Another One\u201d which featured amongst others a host of great female vocalists and the likes of Bucie, Siphokhazi and Busi Mhlongo at the helm of an array of original works. With world demand and interest in a Black Coffee performance starting to stand up and shout so to speak, he began a new phase of growth in 2008 with a string of new Soulistic Music signed releases from Culoe de Song, Tumelo and the great Zakes Bantwini all achieving gold and platinum sales.\n\nIn 2009 Black Coffee dropped his third offering, titled \u2018\u2019Home Brewed\u2019\u2019, featuring Ringo Madlingozi, Zonke, Hugh Masekela, Zakes Bantwini and others, and at the South African Music Awards in 2010 he scooped two awards in the categories \u201cBest Urban Dance Album\u201d and \u201cBest Male Artist\u201d.\n\nHighlights during 2011 included a nomination for the 2011 MTV Europe Awards in the Africa, India and Middle East category for \u201cBest Worldwide Act\u201d, the launch of Africa Rising and its first presentation (which included a 24-piece orchestra along with a band and featured artists performing Black Coffee\u2019s works) at Moses Mabhida Stadium, four releases on the Soulistic Label including Culoe de Song\u2019s \u201cElevation\u201d, Sai & Ribatones \u201cHere and Now\u201d, Boddhi Satva\u2019s \u201cInvocation\u201d and the label\u2019s \u201cSoulistic Cuts\u201d and a Channel O Award for \u201cMost Talented Male Artist\u201d.\n\nIn 2012, Black Coffee\u2019s Africa Rising DVD and CD (triple CD) featuring artists such as Bucie and the soulful Toshi Tikolo on international house hit \"Buya\u201d, garnered double platinum sales status in the space of a single month and went on to win \u201cBest Dance Album\u201d at the 2013 South African Music Awards. All of this transpiring shortly after Soulistic Music announced the signing of Thembisa born rising star DJ Shimza to the imprint.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Soulistic Music under Black Coffee\u2019s leadership has built a worldwide network of exclusive track licenses, tours and agents giving Black Coffee and other Soulistic Music artists their break into the international touring market where they have become regular features in cities from Sydney to New York, London to Luanda and Los Angeles to Athens.\n\nBlack Coffee continued to grow his profile internationally during 2013, gracing the decks at Cape Town Electronic Music Festival, Southport Weekender, ADE and for Berlin\u2019s Panorama Bar, Iberian institution Circoloco and Boiler Room. He also forged a strong relationship with Bridges For Music by taking up the role of official spokesperson and ambassador for the music charity initiative.\n\nFast forward to present day and it\u2019s starkly evident that the past 24 months have been no less than a rollercoaster of career milestones, accolades and achievements for the Durban born musical mastermind. Attention grabbing performances for the likes of Ultra South Africa, FabricLive, BPM Festival, Ballantines\u2019 Boiler Room Stay True, Sonar Barcelona, Mixmag Live, SW4, an 8-date North American tour, RMBA debut tour of Japan, two consecutive seasons as a one of Circoloco\u2019s most talked about residents and a 2015 world tour this past summer which spanned 17 countries across 4 continents over 5 months has elevated Black Coffee into the realm of global superstar in waiting.\n\nIn addition to that, he also launched the Black Coffee Foundation Scholarship with SAE and Bridges For Music, scooped Breakthrough DJ and Dance Nation Of The Year for South Africa at the 2015 DJ Awards and unveiled his 5th artist album titled Pieces of Me to an African audience in September 2015. Both Pieces of Me and the debut album single We Dance Again featuring vocalist Nakhane Tour\u00e9 triumphantly laid claim to the #1 spot on iTunes and the album went on to reach double platinum status within 3 months of release.\n\nAs 2015 drew to a close, accolades continued to roll in unabated. Black Coffee became the first African DJ to be selected by BBC Radio 1 to deliver his 2-hour musical journey for the prestigious Essential Mix. Shortly thereafter, Red Bull revealed an official limited edition Black Coffee hero can and dedicated legacy website centred around celebrating the first decade of immense success achieved by SA\u2019s house music luminary. Black Coffee is the second only musical artist and first person of colour to be singled out and depicted on a Red Bull commemorative can.\n\nBlack Coffee continued his path of global domination at the 22nd annual SAMAs this past June by scooping Album of the Year, Best Dance Album and Best Engineered Album for Pieces of Me. And was also honoured with a prestigious International Achievement Award. Later that same month, Black Coffee made history by becoming the first South African to win a BET Award. He was recognized in the Best International Act: Africa category whilst attending the 3-day awards festivities in Los Angeles.\n\nNotwithstanding an already stellar year, Black Coffee surprised fans across the globe with a re-work of the Alicia Keys track In Common. Black Coffee\u2019s retake released by the award winning US songbird on July 1 as part of a 5-track remix package, has drawn unprecedented praise with many hailing it as the best version of the song. All the while, Black Coffee is still hard at work preparing the worldwide release of \u201cPieces of Me\u2019 through US record label Ultra Music later this year.\n\nFrom family, to community, to clan, to culture, to country, to the world; all are blessed with the prodigious talent and productivity of such a great creative genius, as is Black Coffee.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Z-Trip ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10366768.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronic, Hip-hop, Soul, Turntablism, House, Producer, Edm, Reggae, Funk, Bass, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Z-Trip's roots are based in Hip Hop, but he covers and loves all music styles.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Keita Ogawa (percussionist in Snarky Puppy) and Jamey Haddad discuss the rhythmic exercises they've been doing over many years to internalize the feel into your body so you can be able to play and feel the grove.\n\nEntry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle.

Caitlyn Smith, one of Nashville's most prized writers, is one of them: and, after years spent composing songs for and with everyone from Dolly Parton to Garth Brooks to Meghan Trainor, she's finally ready to unveil all sides of her enormous talent with Starfire. Long lauded for her ability to whirl pure emotion into unforgettable tracks, Starfire is a raw, visceral journey about love, hardship and the struggle to pave your own way, all anchored by her unforgettable tone. A few minutes of listening and one thing becomes abundantly clear: there is no one better to sing the music of Caitlyn Smith than Smith herself.\n\n\"I wanted to unlock my heart and dig around inside a little,\" Smith says about the songs of Starfire, with the first five songs available now. \"And I wanted to be more vulnerable, and tell the stories I have lived. It's more of a raw process to write for myself.\"\n\nIndeed, songs like \"Before You Called Me Baby\" shake the listener to the core: blending her soulful vocals with stirring, deeply honest lyrics and instrumentation that only amplifies the organic construction, they occupy a unique space that can both blossom with a full band or be stripped down into intimate, solo experiences. Because Smith, who has toured and opened for acts such as Eric Church, Sheryl Crow and Dierks Bentley, understands not only how important the craft itself is, but also how music can \u2013 and should - transform in a live setting. With just her acoustic guitar, Smith can stun to silence.\n\nRaised in the small town of Cannon Falls, Minnesota, Smith grew up singing in the church and at county fairs \u2013 and it soon became abundantly clear that her talent stretched well beyond the ordinary. She wrote her first songs at the young age of eight, and had already convinced her parents that a career as an artist was her true path by the time she reached her teenage years. \"I released two records before I graduated high school,\" Smith recalls. \"I knew I needed to do music and nothing else.\" After a stint in Minneapolis, it was clear that Nashville was where she belonged, and she quickly became a sought-after force in the songwriting scene: so much so that even music she intended to sing herself quickly got snatched up by others, yielding her two top country hits, including the platinum \"Wasting All These Tears,\" recorded by Cassadee Pope.\n\nA celebrated force in the writer's room, Smith's also had her songs cut by Parton, Brooks and Lady Antebellum, and co-wrote Trainor's John Legend duet, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" among many others. For a while, Smith balanced her two worlds \u2013 as an artist, and a writer \u2013 while primarily focusing on the latter, working to perfect her craft and discover exactly what she wanted to say in her solo work. She released some music under her own name, but it didn't capture the spirit she ultimately wanted. \"I was shooting for something instead of singing music that was in my heart, that I loved,\" she says, as honest as ever. \"So I stepped back. I said to myself, 'the next thing that I release, I don't want to ask anybody's opinion. I want to go into the studio and make a record that I love and is true to me.'\"\n\nThat next thing became Starfire, produced by Paul Moak, who quickly became Smith's trusted collaborator. They would often bunker down at his Nashville studio, while Smith enlisted friends and colleagues for co-writes, like Gordie Sampson, Kate York and Sarah Buxton. But suddenly, some news came along: Smith was expecting a child. \"It added a beautiful layer of excitement,\" she says. \"Not only was I making a record, but I'm making a life. This little boy has been along for the ride.\"\n\nStarfire, itself, is all about growth, and what it takes to get to your most honest and true incarnation. Smith decided to trust her strengths: her soulful vocals, her strong sense of imaginative storytelling and her ability to craft melodies that exist outside of genre walls and instead focus on timelessness. But there are plenty of infectious hooks in there, too.\n\n\"We didn't want to think about genre or radio or any boundaries,\" she says. Like Chris Stapleton, Maren Morris or even Crow, she artfully blends a steady catalogue of influences and reference points, held together by stellar craft and her formidable voice. \"We wanted to make music that moved us, stay out of the way of the songs and let my voice shine through. Some songs sound more country, some sound more folk. There's a little rock and soul in there, too, which makes it a bit of a genre-less record. But it feels just right to me.\"\n\nGenreless, maybe, but full of vitality, and also downright honest. Take a song like \"This Town is Killing Me,\" about how life as an artist in Music City isn\u2019t all champagne and roses, even when there are small successes. \"It can be a such a hard, heartbreak town,\" Smith says. \"As much as you want to write those songs you know would pay the bills, if you did it every day, the artist part in you would die. There is this balance of loving this town because you get to create, but also it is just so brutal.\" Smith isn\u2019t the kind to smile and nod \u2013 instead, she turns her emotions into moments like this that manage to be about both her own experience and the human condition as a whole.\n\nAnd then there are songs like \"Tacoma,\" devastating in both its lyrics and its sheer beauty: \"I'm burning your memory one mile at a time\" Smith sings in her stunning vocal delivery to stripped-down production. Then, of course, there is the title track, which blends a pop groove with a soulful, chugging chorus. It's about how important it is to keep going even when the world wants to bring you down \u2013 an attitude that has ruled Smith's career thus far. Here, she proclaims her strength to a dynamite beat: it's one thing to have the talent to be a star, but it's another to have the will to keep your fire flaming bright.\n\n\"This whole record and process, I've been on a journey,\" she says. \u201cI've heard no many times and just kept going. I've learned that one thing is for certain: nothing is going to burn me out.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/caitlynsmith"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chi & Greg ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351659.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Gregory Meyer, Chi Ko", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chi & Greg are a Brooklyn-based duo made up of Chi Ko and Gregory Meyer.

Over the next decade, three further critically acclaimed albums followed; \u2018Drastic Fantastic\u2019, \u2018Tiger Suit\u2019 and \u2018Invisible Empire//Crescent Moon\u2019 in 2007, 2010 and 2013 respectively, keeping the platinum sales rolling and cementing the Scottish singer-songwriter\u2019s reputation as a major recording talent, as well as a mesmerising live artist.\n\nTunstall has toured the world many times over. She outsold every other female artist in the UK in 2005, won the 2006 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, won the Ivor Novello Best Song award for her huge, self-penned hit 'Suddenly I See\u2019, and a Q award for Track of the Year. She also landed a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and lent her tunes to a host of movies and TV shows ('Suddenly I See', used in the iconic opening scene of Meryl Streep flick 'The Devil Wears Prada').\n\n2012 and the years that followed saw a seismic shift in outlook - the loss of her father, a divorce, and a relocation to Venice Beach, California.\n\nAfter a period of healing, soul-searching, and a change of scenery, 2016 hailed the arrival of the first of a trilogy of albums, the critically acclaimed UK top 10 album - 'KIN'. The trilogy evokes, separately and in sequence, spirit, body and mind. With 'KIN' being her phoenix- from-the-ashes 'spirit' album, 2018 marked the second offering of that trilogy, the \u2018body\u2019 album \u2018WAX\u2019 - released October 5th.\n\nSpeaking about her 6th studio album, Tunstall says of \u2018WAX\u2019 \u201cI knew before I started writing that I wanted it to be an electric guitar record. It had to be visceral, about the physical, and the weight of that, and the obstacles of that. It\u2019s a record about human-ness, which we so often just write off as \u2018flaws\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe title a nod to the viscous pungency of one of the body\u2019s natural substances. \u201cWax evokes colonies of bees, candlelight, the material that the first long-playing records were made of\u201d, she explains, \u201cbut more than that, wax is produced inside your own head. You unconsciously create it, and then weirdly that same basic substance has been used for centuries to make the most lifelike replicas of human beings. It has a life glow to it. It sticks to you. We have these strange, ancient connections and relationships with wax. How odd is it that the body produces all these substances from all these holes!\u201d laughs this stoutly down-to-earth singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nLead single \u201cThe River\u201d, which was released August 23rd, opens with an arresting synth hook, before Tunstall\u2019s powerful voice enters, emotionally taking centre stage. The track builds with strong rhythmic guitar textures, exploding into an anthemic chorus. Heavy guitar riffs are central to this track capturing the dirt, grit and physicality of the album. Tunstall explains, \u201cit\u2019s about wanting to escape the madness in the world, escaping bad relationships, and wanting to be washed clean - emancipation through nature\u201d. The single was named one of Rolling Stone's \u2018Songs You Need To Know\u2019. The music video, directed by Alexo Wandael, premiered on Clash Magazine and features KT performing a sensual routine with dancer Alex Thomas.\n\nKT released \u2018WAX\u2019 in October 2018 via Virgin Records (UK) / Rostrum Records/ InGrooves (US / RoW). \u201cWAX\u201d entered the UK album chart at number 15 (Tunstall\u2019s 6th Top 20 album in the UK), was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018New Music Friday\u2019 playlist in a dozen countries worldwide and received critical acclaim from both national publications and specialist music outlets in both the UK and USA.\n\nThe Sunday Times - \u201cKiller folk-rock melodies and chord progressions; lyrics rich with emotional intelligence, candour, self-awareness and bite and vocals of immediacy\u201d\n\nThe I \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment she strikes the first meaty chord of her new album, KT sounds visceral capturing the grit of her live shows\u201d\n\nThe Sun 4* \u2013 \u201cWAX provides a gritty collection of classic rock-pop\u201d\n\nSecond single, \u2018Human Being\u2019, was released in December 2018, accompanied by a self- directed video by Tunstall which was premiered on NYLON and features an 8-year-old black belt nunchuck talent Eccaia Sampson. KT says of the video: \u201cMy vision for the video was to create a mirror between a young, crazy- talented, bold little girl, and link that burgeoning energy to a band of warrioress women\u201d. The track was playlisted by BBC Radio 2.\n\nThe last few years have seen something of a creative rebirth for Tunstall. Upon relocating to the west coast of the USA, she was accepted as one of six annual fellows for the Sundance Film Institute\u2019s Composers Lab (hosted by George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch in Northern California) and has since scored music for short and feature films.\nShe has also been awarded the Inspirational Artist gong at the Women In Music Awards and was chosen as the first ever female Grand Marshal (following the likes of Sir Sean Connery) to lead April 2018\u2019s annual New York Tartan Week parade. In May 2018 she and Mike McCready, of legendary multi-million selling Pearl Jam, released a cover of Tom Petty\u2019s huge hit single \u2018I Won\u2019t Back Down\u2019 with proceeds going to Pearl Jam\u2019s Vitalogy Foundation.\n\nIn 2018, KT performed sold-out intimate headline shows across the UK and US and toured worldwide supporting acclaimed artists including Simple Minds, The Pretenders, Barenaked Ladies and Gary Barlow.\n\nSo far in 2019, KT has been on a headline tour across the UK and Europe with her all-female band, played at festivals all over the UK (including a headline set at Glastonbury and sets at Isle of Wight, HebCelt, Larmer Tree and Car Fest), toured across the US & Canada, supported Hall & Oates on their UK arena tour and played shows in Japan and China.\n\nBy the end of 2019, KT will have also played live dates in the Netherlands, Mexico and Brazil.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam & Elvis ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Karima Francis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10354297.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alternative, Singer-songwriter, Indie Rock, Indie, Indie Folk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Making a welcome return to the spotlight, the singer-songwriter from Blackpool delivers an atmospheric and elegiac single for the soul, that emerges as her first new material of 2020.\n\nWrapt in a haze of misty atmospherics and languid acoustics, at its heart \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 is a love song straight and true. Though like almost all love stories, this one is not without its complications. Offering wistful rumination on how mental health can send shockwaves through even the most intimate and entwined of relationships, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 sees Karima strike a masterful balance of meditative and melancholy songwriting.\n\n\u201cIn a world where we sometimes feel we can\u2019t speak out, we tend to take it the worst out on people closest to us.\u201d says Karima, opening-up about the track\u2019s fragile subject matter.\nRelocating from the shores of the Irish Sea to the expansive horizons of the Pacific last year, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 was one of a number of new songs penned in Venice Beach, California, as the singer found herself instinctively drawn to the sun and sounds radiating from the West Coast and its simmering alternative scene. Finding a kindred spirit in LA producer Tim Carr (who also produced her sublime \u2018Shelf Life\u2019 track of last year), the textured and transient feel of \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 is testament to the stimulating new environs Karima found herself writing in.\n\u201cI was fantasising about making more, organic, saturated sounding records for a long time and alongside this, I wanted to record out in America as I was finding most of my musical influences were artists from America.\u201d she says. \u201cLast year I made the move to go out to California to find the sound for the new record and to immerse myself in the West Coast indie/alternative scene and out there, the relationship with Tim bloomed and the music was made.\u201d\n\nDusky of atmosphere and mellifluous of melody, the record also features appearances from close friend Simon Edwards on Bass (who notably played on Talk Talk\u2019s seminal \u2019Spirit of Eden\u2019 record; a favourite of Karima\u2019s), plus London-based singer/songwriter Klara from Sweden who feathers the record with its ethereal omnichord layerings.\n\nProduced by Tim Carr, the track was further mastered by Grammy-nominated Phillip Shaw Bova (Andy Shauf, Father John Misty).\n\n\u2018Orange Rose\u2019 arrives with a captivating video filmed in Las Vegas just before Christmas last year. \u201cI had the idea about a concept of self-destructive behaviour\u201d she says, \u201ca constant running away from our fears which potentially ends in us running away from the people who can make us whole again.\u201d Subtle of narrative and cinematic in quality, the video finds Karima lost deep in thought and caught-up between a rock and a hard place in the Nevada state city. Karima Francis is a critically acclaimed musician and songwriter, renowned for her innate ability to blend haunting melodies with honest lyrics and alluring ambiance. With an ear for music evident from an early age, Karima went on to release her debut album \u2018The Author\u2019 in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. Her consequent album\u2019s \u2018The Remedy\u2019 (2012) and \u2018Black\u2019 (2016) witnessed further acknowledgment of her artistic abilities and saw her truly begin to spread her wings. Her journey to date has found her playing on Later\u2026 With Jools Holland, supporting the likes of Paul Simon, Amy Winehouse and The Stereophonics, as well as working with renowned producer Flood (Nine Inch Nails, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Depeche Mode). Entering her thirties, Karima found a new rhythm to recording life on the West Coast of the USA last year.

Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

Her debut single \"You've Got That Something\" was released in Sweden in 1995. Later the same year, her Swedish breakthrough came with the single \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\". It was slightly less successful in the USA in its 1997 release. These singles became part of the album Robyn Is Here.\n\nRobyn had her North American breakthrough in 1997 when the singles \"Show Me Love\" and \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\" were released. These singles ended up on the Billboard top 10, and both made #2 in Canada. She followed those two singles with the slightly less successful \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\", which was the lead-off single for the 1995 Swedish release. It was ineligible for the Billboard Hot 100 at the time since it was not released as a retail single in the U.S., but did reach #32 on the Hot 100's Airplay chart, and #6 in Canada. The album offered the standard version and a remix causing the album to be re-released with this remix on it.\n\nHer following album My Truth was released in May 17, 1999, but not in the US (though it was promised to be) because her American record company RCA didn't think the album contained any potential hits. The album won rave reviews and is referred to by fans as her best album to date, even garnering her a Grammy (as did Robyn is Here both in the US and Sweden).\n\nIn 2000, Povel Ramel gave her the Karamelodiktstipendiet; a scholarship for her musical achievements where most of the reward lies in the prestige and honor, not the money.\n\nIn 2001, she contributed the song Say You'll Walk The Distance (written by J\u00f6rgen Elofsson) to the soundtrack On The Line.\n\nIn November 2002, she changed labels (from RCA to JIVE) and released the album Don't Stop The Music in Sweden. This album was also promised a US release after a few minor changes were made to it. These changes were never made and it has yet to see an American release. The title track was later covered by Swedish girl group Play, and album track \"Keep This Fire Burning\" was a single for British soul singer Beverley Knight.\n\nIn May 2004, the CD Robyn's Best was released by BMG. It is a shortened version of her first album and contains no material from her other two albums that had been previously released. It is considered by fans to be a poor attempt by her past record label to pass the album off as a greatest hits album.\n\nIn 2005, Robyn released her new single \"Be Mine\", and a month later the album titled Robyn. This music was released by Konichiwa Records, a record label she started in 2004 for the sole purpose of releasing her music. Konichiwa (Misspelling of Japanese 'Konnichi wa', which means \"Hello\") is a reference to the phrase \"Konichiwa bitches!\" by the comedian Dave Chappelle. It is also the name of a rap song in the end of her self-titled album, which is considered to be a little controversial for this young pop singer. The album entered at No. 1 on Swedish charts on May 5th, 2005.\n\nIn December 2006, Robyn released The Rakamonie EP in the UK as a preview to her more recent material. This was followed by the release of \"Konichiwa Bitches\" in March 2007. The revised edition of Robyn was released in the UK on April 2, 2007. The UK release contained new tracks \"With Every Heartbeat\" and \"Cobrastyle\" (a cover of a 2006 single by Swedish rockers Teddybears) alongside two slightly altered versions of the original songs.\n\nThe second single from the UK release was the Kleerup collaboration \"With Every Heartbeat\" which reached number 1 in the singles chart in the UK on August 12, 2007.\n\nShe is also present in EA GAMES \" Fifa 08\" with the song \"Bum Like you\".", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AWOLNATION ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9609563.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie, Indie Rock, Alternative, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "AWOLNATION crafted one of the most influential songs in years with the chart-topping, record-breaking track 'Sail.'

It will include 11 brand new songs. This will be the first record that he has recorded & produced in his own home studio in Co. Armagh. There will also be a special limited edition of the album available only on the benreel.com website, which will include 5 bonus tracks. Since his debut back in 1999, each album has gone from strength to strength, touching on different styles of music from rock,soul,blues, Alt Folk/Americana & with the occasional injection of reggae. This was highlighted on his 2012, 18 song best of album (Ben Reel 1999-2009 Compilation 10) released only as a limited edition for loyal fans to buy at gigs, also available on iTunes worldwide. Ben\u2019s music has evolved into an honest earthy sound that has matured like a fine wine and he has very much his own sound today. This can be heard on this new album. Darkness & The Light is a powerful soulful album with deep meaningful lyrics and memorable epic anthemic songs, with strong melodies combined with imaginitive expansive arrangements. Recorded digitally but with an analog feeling of warmth. The songs deal with the struggles of life of ordinary folk since the global economic crash. Also probing for spiritual meaning and balance between the Yin and the Yang, trying to find light, hope and healing in these troubled times. Serious songs from a serious artist in a serious moment in time. In the last 10 years he has had numerous high profile TV & Radio appearances and airplay under his belt including Bob Harris BBC Radio 2 and has supported names like Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and appeared as a special guest at one of Hal Ketchum's shows in Dublin. He has performed his radio hit \u2018U People\u2019 with the late great Ian Dury\u2019s legendary \u2018Blockheads\u2019 and has recorded the song with award winning saxophonist Gilad Atzmon. Over the last 5 years Ben has enjoyed successful tours in Europe, receiving rave reviews and attracting a growing fan base . His band includes amongst the finest musicians in Ireland, his brother in law Michael Black on Drums, Ronnie O\u2019Flynn on bass and Mick McCarney on guitar. With this line up they have built up a loyal underground following. Ben is often described as an \u2018artist lying beneath the radar for way too long\u2019. In 2011 Ben played showcase gigs in Nashville & Memphis (Folk Alliance) where he colloborated with some of Nashville's finest, David Olney, Sergio Webb & Irene Kelley to name a few. Plans are in the pipeline to return to the U.S in 2013 to promote his new record and to follow up on his success on Airplaydirect.com radio download rock chart, which he has been number 1 for the last 3 months. Plus he will be touring extensively in Ireland, UK & Europe.

Rainy Nights nails down the pang of loneliness that emigrants feel when they are far from home and someone says something that just triggers regret. The easy, soulful melody and performance underlines the impact, with Reel\u2019s singing striking just the right note. It is the high point of the album. Though Feel Alive , the title track and the gospel of Old Bog Road come close. The Armagh singer-songwriter comes across as a honest man determined to use his love of music to best effect, and he is lucky in having a band, particularly guitarist Mick McCarney, full of expression and no little skill. www.benreel.com Download tracks: Rainy Nights, Time to Get Real http://dvdfever.co.uk/reviews/erbenreel.shtml Elly Roberts reviews The Ben Reel Band: Time To Get Real Another little gem from the Emerald Isle. Rating: 8/10 Irishman Ben Reel has consistently released solid albums over the past 10 years. My last CD encounter was 2007\u2019s fabulous New Horizon. Now on his fifth album, Time To Get Real, keeps that tradition well and truly alive with a dazzling collection of Americana crossover songs that ought to have ears pricking at all the \u2018real music\u2019 stations. Reel has a penchant for ignoring fads and trends keeping the focus on real music which is why he\u2019s become a cult artist in his native Ireland, though sadly he hasn\u2019t been picked up as genuine singer-songwriter in the UK. Everybody in the business knows he\u2019s hot stuff having supported Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and stage star Michael Ball no less. The good news is he doing rather well in Holland, Belgium and Germany. As an introduction to the album he\u2019s released Feel Alive as a single. The down and dirty groove has some sublime guitar licks carried by a great melody and his rough edged vocals. ________________________________________ This box of delights opens with a gentle country shuffle in the form of Rainy Night as the band moves with confidence and swagger, again with Reel dropping in some superb guitar breaks and a fine line in vocal gymnastics including falsetto along with a Neil Young-like harmonica swish. The introduction of songbird Julieanne Reek on the deliciously tender love ballad Summers Always Here only adds to the romantic mood. With a troubled heart he gushes with lyrics like \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re like the warm summer sun that\u2019s rising / Feel your warm love in my heart / Melting away the cold ice of winter / The storms have passed / There\u2019s a new life on the way.\u201d Embracing an eclectic mindset, Keep On Drivin\u2019 takes on a C.C.Rider rockabilly hue drenched in honeyed vocals, stylish pedal steel, thumping basslines and wah wah, whereas Time Slips Away is deeply reflective, yearning for his childhood days and the onset of wisdom now he\u2019s turned 35. A heavy funky bass, rolling organ, and acoustic chords make Who You Are the albums catchiest song, with the main hook coming in the chorus. For Old And Wise Reel delves deep into a more traditional Irish template which brings forward his wishes not to die a typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll death \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t wanna overdose like a rockin-roll star /Or choke on my vomit after whiskey in the jar.\u201d By far the best song on the album, closes it \u2013 the stripped back dusty-bowl ballad Old Bog Road. Reverbed harmonica leads to gentle acoustic picks, chords slabs and wailing solos, on what is essentially a mournful ballad. The verdict \u2013 Quality album. http://www.billybop.be/admin/CDdetail.asp?ID=8717 Ben Reel : Time To Get Real \u2013 CD, BRBCDA-007;B Reel Records Album Kindly Submitted by G-Promotions Style : Americana Rate (1-5) : Ben Reel is the latest addition to a series of Americana artists emerging from Ireland! Against the backdrop of the troubles in Northern Ireland, Ben first picked up his guitar when he was 15 years old inspired by greats like Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young. Today this inspirations are still to be found in his passionate music! Leading track \u201cRainy Night\u201d is one of those tunes that you start to whistle along without ever having it heard before! Country and Americana are the main genres on this album but this doesn\u2019t mean the album is limited to it. On \u201cFeel Alive\u201d Ben comes with some enjoyable soul influences while \u201cKeep on drivin\u2019\u201d throws in a lot of country as does \u201cLooking for a Lost Horizon\u201d. \u201cOld & Wise\u201d throws in some old styles and mix folk influences into this Americana tune. On \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d the title track of this album, Ben Reel, returns to his old habits and creates a song that could be from the hand of \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Closing down the album is \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d that opens with a beautiful haunting blues harp. The haunting keeps going on, both with his voice and slide guitar! As an extra, hidden track we can hear a nice rockabilly kind of version (Live) of Keep on Drivin\u2019 in a mix with the classic \u201cTrain Train\u201d Time To Get Real is already the fifth album for Ben Reel and in the past two years he has successfully toured Holland, Belgium and Germany steady working on a growing fan base. Back you\u2019ll can find him as supporting act for bands like the Cranberries, Alabama 3 or Jools Holland. The album is a true Americana effort and comes with handful of interesting tunes that makes me feel that this artist need to be in the spotlight a little more. Mr Blue Boogie http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews2009/ben_reel.htm BEN REEL Time To Get Real (2009) Play this new Ben Reel CD to any music aficionado, and ask them where it was recorded. Nine out of ten would say Nashville. Guaranteed. Now, Ben Reel may not be a household name (yet), but let's assume for a moment his work is unfamiliar to you. OK, what genre music would you say Time To Get Real was? No problem - southern, country blues rock. And name any influences you can hear at play? Again, no problem - Neil Young is an obvious one, but also Springsteen and perhaps Chris Isaak and even a little Clapton circa 361 Ocean Boulevard. So, nationality? No brainer - a man from the deep south of the US of A. Wrong on all accounts, because Time To Get Real is the 5th album in 10 years from Irish guitarist and singer songwriter Ben Reel. And naturally it was recorded in Monaghan in the north of the emerald isle. In reviewing Ben's last album New Horizon (2007) - which had an altogether more 'west coast' feel - we pondered on image, and what might make Ben stand out from the likes of Marc Cohn. It may be that with Time to Get Real, and diving deep into Americana, Ben has found his niche. Beautifully played and recorded it's bound to strike a chord with the market that's fuelling the resurgence of Neil Young, and Springsteen's exploration of the American psyche. But the challenge is still to get his music across the pond. It's not easy to crack America - many have tried and failed, but the rootsy warmth of the songs, the soulful singing and classy playing (some wonderful blues guitar and harmonica work) would undoubtedly be lapped up with a little exposure. So remember the name - Ben Reel - a real class act. *** Review by Pete Whalley http://www.lonesomehighway.com/pdf/online-issue-7.pdf Ben Reel Time To Get Real B. Reel Northern Ireland native Ben Reel has delivered a roots album that is full of strong songs and good playing. There\u2019s some solid keyboard playing, a rhythm section that drives things along and some very tasty guitar from Mick McCarney. Reel\u2019s voice is accompanied by welcome backing vocals that help to portray the mood of the songs. Rainy Night sets the tone for time and place, a song that looks at what has been missed by moving away from your home town. Other topics are ageing, freedom, the nature of searching and of truth. Mature songs for a mature audience that\u2019s given a melodic and malleable musical base that could just as easily have come from the States as from Northern Ireland. Reel no doubt has taken from those who have also come from the North, such as the undeniable influence of Van Morrison as a beacon of musical innovation. Reel does not have Morrison\u2019s track record, but this is an album that shows all the signs of a true talent making his own way. It\u2019s time to get serious is the signal Ben Reel gives with the release of his latest cd \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he before? Haven\u2019t got a clue because for me Ben Reel is a complete stranger. He is (northern) Irish and has been working at his craft for quite some time. \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d sure is a good way to get to know him and the cd is full of piercing impulses. Delicate songs, strongly carried by the accompanying musicians, but by no tarnishing ben\u2019s Vocals. (His vocals show comparisons to Rod MacDonald and John Stewart). I hope that I grow old and wise suggests that Ben has come to an age where he starts realising his own mortality, what undoubtedly determines the profundity you find again in his lyrics. With what I don\u2019t want to affect his compositions. As I said before, I only know Reels past from what I read in his biography, But \u201cTime to get Reel\u201d indeed looks like the start of a new development, a new awakening. No trace of a personal crisis. My guts tell me Ben Reel has defined he wants to make a good product. One he will be remembered by. The closing song \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d tells of a permanent goodbye Ben Reel manages to create a excellent variation of styles, and within a limited nr of spins I still a real positive feeling about Ben Reel. Serious, skilful. driven \u2026. (after the official songs there is a hidden track, a live song, where you hear the presence of a modern day Elvis. Not renewed, but very entertaining. www.rootstime.be /Rein van den Berg Oct 09 The Irish hearts are often rather melancholic. Maybe the beautiful sceneries see to a tendensy of warmth and retirement. It characterizes at any rate the dark songs of Ben Reel, which the cover of the newest album, time to get real, suggest. Eleven songs written by reel himself and richly arranged with violin, piano, appropriate guitar lines and a choice of extra additioned instruments. With this the Irish know how to display a large scale of spheres and feelings, carying names as Neil Young and sometimes Bob Dylan. Indeed in rags, because Ben Reel is a slippery costumer. Ben\u2019s first album, \u201cthis is the movie\u201d, came out in Ireland in 1999, after this the EP \u00ebxorcise me\u201d(2000) only with 3 tracks, which seemed to be forerunner for his second album \u201cLost in Haze\u201d (2001). After that came Sweet Victory (2004), U People (2006) and New Horizon (2007). We don\u2019t have to complain about man\u2019s releases and qualities: guitarplayer Ben Reel, born in silverbridge but now living in Castlebalyney, is a supreme storyteller; has a pleasant voice, writes, beside that, upperclass songs and has also the quality to gather very able musicians around him. At his new album Ben Reel is accompanied again by a fine equilibiated band: Ronnie, Michael. Mickey, John, Colin. And now we are calling names: the recordings were done in the Attic studios with producer Ronan who also has a vocal contribution in the last two songs. In the quite openers Rainy Summers etc. we hear Reel\u2019s wife Julieanne who takes the change of the singing second. Anyway, in their natural but yet larger soundscape is more than enough space for improvisation and variety, which we can hear clearly on their new album. What Ben has settled with this successor is impressing. In 11 songs the band knows to create an oppressing atmosphere, which gets enlightened only now and then. Rasping and grating, then again with deceptive lovely acoustic guitars, then with thin guitarsounds and spacious violin, the listener is taking to a voyage through the Deep South of the mind, which only can turn out bad. It is oppressing, dark, stirring and especially very beautiful. Roots, pop and folk are going hand in hand with now and then an experimental strain. The point is that Ben Reel makes magnificent music. Music that mixes influences from alt-country with the atmospheric and darkness the music from Ireland so often charcterizes. Music that attracts attention by the variety and the highstanding music, because they really can play. Ben Reel searches, with his new album, joining with the greatness of the alt-country, but takes here at the same time surrender. Time to get real is just a good patterncard of the ability of the Ben Reel Band. Everything sounds beautiful, clear and especially respectable. The sharp ends are removed expertly and almost everything is produced in a way that it has to be specially accessed for the singersongwriter radiosize.

There's lots to inspire and Ben Reel has absorbed those influences and let them inform his particular style of travelling blues. \"Time To Get Real\" isn't a classic troubadour album, but it is deep hearted blues packed with characters, places and just a wee bit of drinking. The songs are strong through out, all could standalone without being thought of as filler. Time to step up from being a solid support to being the headliner. BELGUIM http://www.ctrlaltcountry.be/Pagina1.htm#BenReel BEN REEL \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d (Ben Reel) (3,5****) Ireland has long been enjoying a good reputation, where the singer-songwriters are concerned. And with Ben Reel has another one to be proud of. With \"Time To Get Real\" the man has just delivered his fifth album in ten years time, and that is a very beautiful album. Reel is gifted with a warm, a little soulful vocal style, shows himself a truly excellent song smith and professional manner together in genres like rock, pop, folk, Americana and blues into his songs. He calls himself Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young as inspiration, but there really is not much sign of that. Reel sounds like a particularly original. Someone with a vision of his own writing and placing songs. Someone with an own sound. And it would absolutely not surprise us if he behave the songs on \"Time To Get Real\" soon break on larger scale. He fully deserves it already! Songs like it a little reminiscent of Neil Young \"Rainy Night\", the beautifully subdued piano and harmonica work on-going rootspopdeuntje \"Summer's Always Here\", the soulful rockin 'Feel Alive', the bluesy bounce \"Keep On Drivin '\", the summer, somewhere between pop, folk and country resident \"Old & Wise\" is simply magnificent. (Ben Reel is doing these days also Netherlands and Belgium for some gigs. On November 13 he is as such in McCormack's Irish Pub in Turnhout. And De Sport in Geel On Monday 9th http://www.ilpopolodelblues.com/rev/novembre09/recensione/ben-reel.html Ben Reel is part of the wide array of successful songwriters born and raised in Ireland. More precisely, the North and administratively part of the English crown. Yet in his music are heard echoes of Neil Young or Bruce Springsteen rather than those of the island's musical tradition. Twenty years ago Ben Reel Trim The Velvet founded the group while her debut album This is the Movie goes back to 1999. Among his collaborations Jools Holland, Alabana 3 and the Cranberries.

I can see the clouds are clearing, I can see the clear blue skies, I can feel my fear is fading, Blowin away your seeds of doubt, just cast them out ... from the title track \"Time To Get Real\" and the closing track \"Old Bog Road\" I do strongly think that living legend Steve Young and Ben Reel immediately implies that for a while doing good is cruel! (SWA) REAL ROOTS CAF\u00c9 Netherlands Dutch to English translation Very recently came from Time to get real, the fifth full-time CD of Irish singer-songwriter Ben Reel. For me a great unknown, but already 20 years active in music since he was a teenager in 1989 founded his first band, \"Trim the Velvet '. After the breakup of this band eight years later, Ben's solo tour in 1999 and came from his solo CD's available. With five number one so he just scored an average of two years each. Ben's music is best described as Irish mid-tempo alt-country, the songs are nice sound and treat a number of pressing issues for Ben. He describes one part of his life and Rainy Night Time just slips away, do proclaim his feelings, especially love, respect, in four songs and shares his thoughts with us and future expectations in another four songs. He concludes (No. 11 is) a kind of summary of this in Old Bog Road: Seasons change as people come and go, life and death is the endless flow. Want to find the answers, because the story to be told, is not gonna quit the mining for gold. Want to find a reason before I go. Before they take my body, down that old bog road. Heavy thoughts for a guy who has several years of the 40 removed. But we are not all looking for the deeper meaning of life? Incidentally, after more than six minutes of the final number is still nearly six minutes a lasting valve closure, which Ben totally in style and tempo rocking (leading to a sodden organ) announces yet another time by a wish to: (I 'll) keep on driving, a live concert recording and a perfect valve. Always funny, some unexpected hidden track. Ben's band was great response and are in addition to Ben's acoustic guitar (and occasional harmonica) bass, drums and electric guitar. A few songs do keyboards and violin along. Ben has a somewhat gritty but pleasant voice. His wife Julianne sings along to eight songs, four songs is half Bloch (e, you never know with those Irish first names) to hear. I think it's a good CD, especially through the expressiveness of the songs both lyrically and in terms of melody (Fred Schmale) Put simply and aptly, New Horizon is all killer, no filler! Rarely have I heard an album so complete and so fully realised. From the brilliance of the playing and arranging to the magnificence of Reel's voice, this is heaven all the way. A superb album by an artist good enough to hold his own in rock\u2019s premiere league. Andrew Hobbs, Hi Fi + magazine When it comes to making classy albums, Ben Reel's your man. Year on year, Reel's songwriting is growing in stature in every department, yet he still doesn't get the wide spread recognition he richly deserves it's one of the strongest albums this year. This CD isn't just music: it's art. AllGigs.co.uk review of New Horizon, 8th October 2007 Ben Reel, a native of South Armagh, has in the words of one journalist \u2018operated under the media\u2019s radar for far too long\u2019. On the evidence of this release, his fourth album, I would have to agree. The songs and the playing are really impressive, an earthy mix of rock, roots and blues, all mixed lovingly together with soulful vocals. His song writing shows maturity and progression which comes through with repeated plays. Featuring some great slide guitar from Micky McCarney and terrific vocals from Kelie Redmond, \u201cHell In Ur Own Head\u201d is a standout, closely followed by the semi spoken \u201cWhen Will Be Ever Be Free\u201d. \u201cFor U And I\u201d shows the band at their best with a lovely rock/soul groove that you wish would go on longer. All in all this is an impressive album from a major talent who needs further investigation.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "Pub Party Fridays brought to you by Flora Hall Brewing.

Gods Of Violence lives and breathes!\n\nAs is often the case, it all started with a good idea. KREATOR mastermind Mille Petrozza had followed the latest news with growing concern. Especially the November 2015 Paris attacks made him realize that there had to be a continuum of human malevolence, running like a thread through the ages, from ancient times up to the present day. These thoughts led Petrozza to interlocking current events with tales from Greek mythology, eventuating in the song Gods Of Violence that was consequently chosen as the album\u2018s name giver. \u201cCurrently, religion has regained a level of importance that I would have never considered possible 20 years ago,\u201d Mille states. \u201cAn extremely dangerous polarization is taking place, giving rise to growing hate among us all. That\u2018s what I wanted to write about.\u201d\n\nLike this, a key note of the album was found that is also reflected in the sheer brutality of \u201cWorld War Now\u201d, among others. The song\u2018s deriving from the observation that we\u2018re in the middle of a World War III of sorts, but not in the way we\u2018ve always feared: A-bomb dropped, humanity wiped out. \u201cThese days, our weapons of mass destruction are called hatred and religious delusion,\u201d says Petrozza.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Friday I will transport my viewers into the past where they will feel as thought they are sitting behind the recording console at Motown's Hitsville recording studio.

The multi-faceted Renaissance man proves it on his upcoming new studio album, aptly titled A Whole Lot More To Me, a record that furthers Morgan's reputation as one of the genre's most commanding vocalists.\n\nWhile his singing on such hits as the multi-week Number One \"That\u2019s What I Love About Sunday,\" \"International Harvester,\" \"Bonfire,\" \"This Ole Boy\" and \"Wake Up Lovin' You\" was exemplary, Morgan has somehow found a new level and vocal range in the studio. On his forthcoming LP, his third with label home Black River Entertainment, he's making the most relevant, authentic and moving music of his career. It's a point that \"When I'm Gone\" drives home, as Morgan sings about living life with no regrets.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a renewed energy with this record,\" he says emphatically. \"In fact, I'm at the pinnacle of my career \u2014 producing, singing and touring. And this song epitomizes that. It's about living to the fullest, and when people hear it, I know they'll relate it to their own lives.\"\n\nHis newest single, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon,\u201d is an epic love song and one of many radio-ready hits on Morgan's highly anticipated project. He's written nearly half of the album's dozen tracks, and makes all of them his own. \"I'm That Country\" exudes Southern charm; \"Remind Me Why I'm Crazy\" showcases Morgan the crooner; \"I Can't Wait to Stay\" exults the joys of a small-town life; and \"A Whole Lot More to Me\" is a musical autobiography. The collection\u2019s \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone,\u201d has already met critical acclaim with Music Row calling it a \u201cpowerhouse performance of a pile-driving song.\u201d Each highlights his artistic renaissance.\n\nMorgan laughs at that word, however: \"artistic.\"\n\n\"I have friends who are very artistic people, sometimes oddly so, and I never wanted to be that guy, to be so artistic that I'm odd,\" he says smiling. \"But it's good to know that I've evolved musically and, with this new record, I've created something with longevity.\"\n\nIndeed, Morgan's A Whole Lot More To Me, co-produced with Byron Gallimore (Tim McGraw, Sugarland, Faith Hill) and released via Black River Entertainment, is a timeless recording. As was their goal, Morgan and Gallimore, with whom he worked for the first time, succeeded in making music that will sound fresh a decade or more from now. These are songs that define a man.\n\nMorgan uses the honesty of the concert stage as an analogy for how he assembled what will be his seventh studio album. \"It would look funny if you went to one of my concerts and I stood out there in skinny jeans. I'm not 21 years old, and I shouldn't pretend to be,\" he says. \"But I also know this music will fit right in on country radio today. I'm singing music that is real and believable and at the same time relatable to all types of fans. That's hard to do, but you can do it if you stay true to who you are.\"\n\nAnd Craig Morgan knows exactly who he is, a man with many sides. Along with being an entertainer, he's an adventure junkie and hosts the popular Outdoor Channel series Craig Morgan: All Access Outdoors, entering its seventh season this summer. He's also a 17-year Army and Army Reserves veteran, a passionate champion of the military, a philanthropist and a celebrated motivational speaker.\n\nHe\u2019s a busy man with a knack for attention to detail. Carefully choosing each lyric on this album is no exception. There is not a single wasted verse \u2014 let alone word \u2014 on the follow-up to 2012's This Ole Boy. \"Every word is valid and relevant on this album,\" he says. \"It's a quality continuation of what I've done in the past.\"\n\nThe most obvious bridge to Morgan's back catalog is the spiritually minded \"Country Side of Heaven.\" The song is inspirational country at its finest, with a soaring chorus that at once elevates both listener and artist.\n\n\"It has a very charismatic, inspirational vibe about it \u2014 but not preachy,\" Morgan says. \"The energy feels spiritual by the time you get to the end and there is an emotional attachment within you that makes you want to hear it again and again.\"\n\nMorgan says the song, as well as album tracks like the emotionally charged \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon\u201d and the empowered-woman tale \"All Cried Out,\" act as a through-line, a path for fans to connect the dots of his career: \"You develop a fan base and they get acquainted with a certain thing from you, and they want that. This album is full of those.\"\n\nAnother standout on the project is \u201cHearts I Leave Behind,\u201d which features Morgan\u2019s gritty and poignant vocals with the soulful Christian rock band Third Day\u2019s lead singer, Mac Powell.\n\nThe hard-touring artist has already been testing out the songs on the road, to stellar results. \"When I'm Gone\" becomes a call to action; \"Country Side of Heaven\" is an audience sing-along; and \"Nowhere Without You,\" written by Michael McDonald, stands as an epic power ballad.\n\n\"It's such an emotional song, one that I can see being played at weddings for a long time,\" he says. \"I feel something in my chest when I hear it. It moves me \u2014 and that's what music is supposed to do.\"\n\nEspecially in the hands of an artist as gifted as Morgan, who can effortlessly toggle between the breezy fun of radio staple \"Redneck Yacht Club\" and the poignancy of \"That's What I Love About Sunday.\" He mixes both approaches in the album's standout track, \"A Whole Lot More to Me.\" A smoldering, jazz-influenced love song with an everyman attitude, it shines a light on a different side of the artist, and country fans in general \u2014 one that likes a fine Cabernet as much as a cold beer, and indulges in sushi by candlelight as regularly as barbecue by the bonfire.\n\n\"As a country singer, we sometimes get stereotyped as nothing but trucks and tailgates, but that doesn't mean that's all there is to us,\" he says, summing up the album. \"I want people to hear this record and go, 'Wow, there is a whole lot more to these country folks.'\"\n\nAnd in Morgan, those folks have no better messenger.", "otherInfo": "Fridays at Four Live Series"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ward Hayden & The Outliers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8813059.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alt-country, Country, Rockabilly, Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Their love for early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, true country, raw blues and pretty much any kind of authentic American music branded them quickly as anomalous \u2014 and electrifying.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dixie Jade ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8996625.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Rock, Pop, Country", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With their own brand of Country Pop Rock, Dixie Jade blend their love for classic country and vintage soul with in-your-face pop radio production.

It was tough, but it built character for sure.\u201d\n\nCiting his parents as the main reason he got into music, John credits them for their influence. \u201cThey are the only reason why music was introduced at an early age.\u201d John\u2019s musical tastes were formed early on by the southern rock sounds of Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and The Black Crowes. As country music took a huge leap forward in the 1990s, John found himself in awe of one of country music\u2019s greatest entertainers, Garth Brooks.\n\nWhen it comes to the fans, the bar is set high according to John. \u201cI love the way Garth treats his fans like royalty\u2026I wanna be like that\u2026 If you\u2019ve made a long career in country music it\u2019s because your fans love you.\u201d As King puts it, \u201cEntertaining a crowd, meeting the fans, hearing their stories, seeing them have the time of their lives\u2026that is what God put me here to do\u2026that\u2019s my passion.\u201d\n\nJohn took serious interest in guitar when he realized he could figure out how to play his favorite songs, but then went on to modify them. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that I could write my own music. I started by playing familiar melodies and turning them into funny songs with lyrics about my friends.\u201d Once John settled into the position of lead singer, his voice began to change the sound of the band. \u201cOur early bands were rock bands but my voice was country. I grew up country, I talked country, and I wrote country songs.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating high school, John decided to arm himself with a music degree and went to study at the University of Georgia. It was during his time at UGA that the formation of John\u2019s musical footprint would really take shape. John\u2019s music career was in full developmental swing during his time at Georgia. \u201cMy time at UGA helped me tremendously,\u201d John said with a very serious tone. \u201cIt made me realize I could make a career out of doing what I love.\u201d\n\nHis dedication and tenacity paid off in opening slots for nationally recognized, award-winning artists-a feat that is virtually unheard of for a young, unsigned artist. This tenacity caught the attention of world renowned booking agent Kevin Neal (Jason Aldean, FGL, Cole Swindell) in 2013.\n\nIn a short time, King has been making a name for himself in Country Music. John's debut radio single, \u201cTonight Tonight,\u201d earned him his first Top 40 hit and was heard by millions of NFL fans and used to highlight CBS network\u2019s Thursday night football throughout the 2014 season.\n\nIn addition to his rising success as an artist, King is also earning national recognition as a songwriter. In early 2016, King experienced his first #1 with a song called \u201cWe Went\u201d recorded by artist Randy Houser. King co-wrote the song with friends, Matt Rogers and Justin Wilson and received a 2016 ASCAP Songwriter Award for the song's success. King has gone on to write songs for some of Country\u2019s biggest stars. King also penned the first Hootie and The Blowfish song to be released since 2005. \u201cRollin\u201d is featured on their upcoming album.\n\nJohn continues touring countless dates building his fanbase and in late 2016, signed his first management deal with Narvel Blackstock and Starstruck Entertainment. Narvel has been instrumental in the rise of Superstars like Reba, Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson. In late 2017, King released the single \"I Still Pick Up\" from his latest project. The song debuted Top 5 on the Apple Music Hot Chart and has already gained over 1 million streams. The music video recently debuted on CMT and was voted Top 10 on the countdown.\n\nKing\u2019s releases \u201cHeat Wave\u201d and \u201cNever Wanna Be\u201d both debuted on Spotify\u2019s \u201cNew Boots\u201d playlist and gained over 3 million cumulative streams. In April of 2018, King signed a major publishing deal with Sony/ATV Nashville. He is currently on tour.\n\nKing\u2019s current single, \u201cTry Saying Goodbye\u201d pulls from his storytelling prowess. It has already garnered more than 15 million streams and 30 major market radio adds including Atlanta, Boston and Seattle. It was described by Tom Roland, of Billboard Magazine, as \u201ca de facto ear worm that continues to connect.\u201d CMT stated \u201cWith fresh melodies and lyrics mixed with old school believability, John King is a serious new artist you need to have on your playlists\u201d. It was named one of Rolling Stone\u2019s Top 10 Country Songs, earning features from , Amazon, Whiskey Riff, Taste of Country and more. It was also featured on Apple Music\u2019s \u201cBest of the Week\u201d, \u201cA-List\u201d, \u201cBreaking Country\u201d and \u201cBroken Down\u201d Playlists.

The new album mixes traditional Irish music with modern influences, creating a sound that's as wide-ranging as the band's own audience.\n\nFrom bluegrass fans and country cowboys to Deadheads, rock & rollers and Celtic fanatics, Gaelic Storm has built one of the most diverse fan bases in modern music. Matching Sweaters helps explain the broad appeal. Rooted in the songwriting of founding members Patrick Murphy and Steve Twigger, the album moves from drinking songs (\"Another Stupid Drinking Song\") to energetic instrumentals (\"The Narwhaling Cheesehead\") to rootsy pop/rockers (\"Whiskeyed Up and Womaned Out\"), gluing everything together with the spark and spirit of a band that's spent close to 20 years on the road.\n\n\"We're a touring band,\" says percussionist Ryan Lacey, who joined the lineup in 2003. \"That's how this band works.Matching Sweaters is one of the most complete albums we've done so far, because it taps into every facet of our live show.\"\n\nThose live shows date all the way back to the mid-1990s, when Gaelic Storm kicked off its career as a pub band in Santa Monica, California. By the end of the decade, the musicians had appeared in the blockbuster film \"Titanic\" (where they performed \"Irish Party in Third Class\") and laid the groundwork for a career that would eventually find them topping the Billboard World Chart five times, making appearances at mainstream music festivals such as Summerfest, Telluride and The Rock Boat Cruise, and regularly headlining the largest Irish Festivals across the country, all the while gaining a reputation as a genre-bending Irish band whose songs mix Celtic traditions with something new and unexpected. Now, with the band's 20th anniversary on the horizon, they're putting even more emphasis on those newer directions.\n\n\"We'll push the envelope, then reel it back in, then push it again,\" says Murphy. \"There's a lot of variety here, and that's why we can play country festivals, bluegrass festivals and rock festivals, and still fit in perfectly with each one. We wanted Matching Sweaters to reflect that range, so people could buy the CD and hear everything we're able to do in concert.\"\n\nWhen it came time to write Matching Sweaters' 12 songs, Murphy and Twigger teamed up with longtime friend and co-writer Steve Wehmeyer. Together, the three found inspiration in everything from old Irish newspapers (\"The Rustling Goat Gang,\" whose details were gleaned from an article about a vanishing goat herd from Waterford) to bits of conversation overheard in local pubs (\"Paddy's Rubber Arm\").\n\nIn addition to writing new songs, the musicians have continued to play new markets every year, taking the chance to stretch their boundaries \u2014 and widen their audience \u2014 whenever possible. It helps keep them on their toes.\n\n\"Playing for a new crowd is great,\" says Twigger. \"It takes you back to those early days, where you've got something to prove. We could just do Irish festivals, but why not play a crossover show where 90% of the audience doesn't know you, and you have to make them know you? That's what makes your band good.\"\n\nMatching Sweaters follows in that hard-working tradition, dishing up all the ingredients fans have come to expect from Gaelic Storm \u2014 the drinking songs, sea shanties, furiously-strummed instrumentals and sing-along melodies \u2014 while spiking the mix with newer flavors. Eat it up, but make sure to save some room!

We were standing among guitar amps, drum stands, cymbals, pedals and cases that had been drenched from a faulty ceiling. We saw a heads up penny at the edge of the door and decided to do the best we could to keep our heads up and our spirits high.\nWe have been together for three years since then. In that time we\u2019ve been paying our dues. It\u2019s undoubtedly been work but we\u2019ve had a great time nonetheless. Playing cover shows week in and week out has given us the opportunity to hone our skills as musicians, learn how to run a business and figure out who we are and what we want out of this dream.\nThere\u2019s often a stigma that comes along with being in a cover band. It can be viewed as selling out. In our experience, a cover band can be an effectual incubator for something wildly original. For instance, if you\u2019re a chef, you\u2019re most likely cooking someone else's recipe. If you\u2019re a salesman, you\u2019re most likely selling someone else\u2019s product. If you're a musician (who's making any money), you're most likely playing someone else's music. And just like the chef who can go home and cook a meal inspired by his work and the salesman can go home and successfully convince his kid to eat broccoli, musicians can learn so much from playing other people's music. This is where we find much of the inspiration to create something of our own.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a lot. For one, it IS possible to make a living playing music - even though most won\u2019t suggest it and it\u2019s not easy or glamorous. For two, not having a boss is as good as it sounds. And for three, there\u2019s nothing else we\u2019d rather be doing.\nWe\u2019ve released two EP\u2019s of original music. \u201cWinnebago Soul\u201d came out in 2017 and \u201cOnward and Upward\u201d came out in 2018. Both EP\u2019s are available on all major streaming services. We learned a lot from the creation and production of those ten tunes. But having focused much of our time in the last three years to establish ourselves as a successful cover band, we haven\u2019t focused on original music as much as we would have liked. But now we are collectively ready for a paradigm shift. Of course, we will continue our business as a cover band with the utmost passion and professionalism, but now it is time to also devote serious attention to original music. January 2019 marks the beginning of recording our first full-length album. Our hearts are full and our faith is strong. We\u2019re excited to share our journey with you.", "otherInfo": "Heads Up Penny will be streaming to the Wild Wing Cafe official Facebook Page."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Matt Butler ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9906462.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Folk, Americana, Punk, Rock, Country", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cRedemption and hope through song sums it up when I think of Matt Butler\u201d says Kevin Lyman, the founder of the legendary Vans Warped Tour, who hosted Butler as one of the few solo acoustic acts on the Tour\u2019s final cross country run in 2018; Matt was back as a mainstage performer at the Warped Anniversary show the following year. In the time before and after, Butler\u2019s been relentlessly on the road performing at everything from stadiums to state prisons. With a rocked out electric and a heartbreaking live acoustic version being released simultaneously (February 19th), Butler\u2019s latest single \u2018Tell Lucy That I Love Her\u2019 is ripped straight from the experience of performing over 150 shows in correctional facilities across the United States. Moreover, the new single exemplifies how Butler\u2019s music shines a light into some of the darkest corners of our world. He paints vivid pictures of pain and truth while exposing the glimmers of hope that only exist in those raw moments where redemption is born.\n\nThat skillful storytelling has led Butler to some unlikely venues. Shortly after the release of his debut album Reckless Son in 2016, he wrote and performed \u2018Just One\u2019, the original song for the feature length and nationally distributed documentary Generation Found - A film about teens struggling with substance abuse and special schools supporting their path to recovery. Suddenly at the center of a growing national movement, in November of 2016 Matt was invited to play a concert for the incarcerated population \u201cbehind the walls\u201d of Albany County Jail. Following a glowing response, word of the show quickly spread and requests to perform at other facilities culminated in an entire \u2018Behind the Walls\u2019 Tour of state prisons across Ohio. Afterwards, he was named a \u20182017 Leader In Mental Health Awareness\u2019 by The National Alliance On Mental Illness (NAMI). Deeply inspired by these experiences, Butler established the Just One Foundation(501c3) in 2018 which brings art with a mission and a message into underserved communities.\n\nMatt kicked off 2020 by releasing the David Bendeth (Paramore, Bruce Hornsby) produced anthem \u2018Like A River\u2019 - a track inspired by the chance to be of service that exists in each moment of everyday life. As he continues to record, Butler\u2019s new music draws heavily on the stories of people he\u2019s met on the road and behind the walls. With accessible writing and relatable characters, upcoming singles like \u2018Justice or Mercy\u2019 and \u2018Been Gone So Long\u2019 can\u2019t help but stir compassion in a listener. Each song has a transcendent quality that shows us how universal our struggles and experiences can really be.\n\nTo date, Butler has now performed in more than 30 correctional facilities across 11 states and continues this work alongside his regular touring. He\u2019s a staple figure at New York City\u2019s famous \u2018Rockwood Music Hall\u2019 and performs in venues as diverse as local high schools, yoga centers and spiritual retreats. He\u2019s also gained recognition as a sought after keynote speaker (with guitar in hand, of course).", "otherInfo": "We\u2019re bringing American Folk Art Museum's acclaimed music series to you!\n\nJoin us for performances by Taylor Plas, Matt Butler, and Miwa Gemini."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jon McLaughlin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9119296.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Classical Pop, Easy Pop, Pop, Rock, Pop Rock, Easy Listening", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Everything in Jon McLaughlin\u2019s life makes its way into his music, whether he\u2019s conscious of it or not.

Studio album No.6 - \u2018WAX\u2019 - the 2nd in a trilogy, out now.\n\nSince scoring a worldwide smash with her debut album \u2018Eye To The Telescope\u2019 in 2004, which went on to sell over 5 million copies, KT Tunstall has remained at the forefront of UK singer- songwriter talent. Over the next decade, three further critically acclaimed albums followed; \u2018Drastic Fantastic\u2019, \u2018Tiger Suit\u2019 and \u2018Invisible Empire//Crescent Moon\u2019 in 2007, 2010 and 2013 respectively, keeping the platinum sales rolling and cementing the Scottish singer-songwriter\u2019s reputation as a major recording talent, as well as a mesmerising live artist.\n\nTunstall has toured the world many times over. She outsold every other female artist in the UK in 2005, won the 2006 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, won the Ivor Novello Best Song award for her huge, self-penned hit 'Suddenly I See\u2019, and a Q award for Track of the Year. She also landed a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and lent her tunes to a host of movies and TV shows ('Suddenly I See', used in the iconic opening scene of Meryl Streep flick 'The Devil Wears Prada').\n\n2012 and the years that followed saw a seismic shift in outlook - the loss of her father, a divorce, and a relocation to Venice Beach, California.\n\nAfter a period of healing, soul-searching, and a change of scenery, 2016 hailed the arrival of the first of a trilogy of albums, the critically acclaimed UK top 10 album - 'KIN'. The trilogy evokes, separately and in sequence, spirit, body and mind. With 'KIN' being her phoenix- from-the-ashes 'spirit' album, 2018 marked the second offering of that trilogy, the \u2018body\u2019 album \u2018WAX\u2019 - released October 5th.\n\nSpeaking about her 6th studio album, Tunstall says of \u2018WAX\u2019 \u201cI knew before I started writing that I wanted it to be an electric guitar record. It had to be visceral, about the physical, and the weight of that, and the obstacles of that. It\u2019s a record about human-ness, which we so often just write off as \u2018flaws\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe title a nod to the viscous pungency of one of the body\u2019s natural substances. \u201cWax evokes colonies of bees, candlelight, the material that the first long-playing records were made of\u201d, she explains, \u201cbut more than that, wax is produced inside your own head. You unconsciously create it, and then weirdly that same basic substance has been used for centuries to make the most lifelike replicas of human beings. It has a life glow to it. It sticks to you. We have these strange, ancient connections and relationships with wax. How odd is it that the body produces all these substances from all these holes!\u201d laughs this stoutly down-to-earth singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nLead single \u201cThe River\u201d, which was released August 23rd, opens with an arresting synth hook, before Tunstall\u2019s powerful voice enters, emotionally taking centre stage. The track builds with strong rhythmic guitar textures, exploding into an anthemic chorus. Heavy guitar riffs are central to this track capturing the dirt, grit and physicality of the album. Tunstall explains, \u201cit\u2019s about wanting to escape the madness in the world, escaping bad relationships, and wanting to be washed clean - emancipation through nature\u201d. The single was named one of Rolling Stone's \u2018Songs You Need To Know\u2019. The music video, directed by Alexo Wandael, premiered on Clash Magazine and features KT performing a sensual routine with dancer Alex Thomas.\n\nKT released \u2018WAX\u2019 in October 2018 via Virgin Records (UK) / Rostrum Records/ InGrooves (US / RoW). \u201cWAX\u201d entered the UK album chart at number 15 (Tunstall\u2019s 6th Top 20 album in the UK), was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018New Music Friday\u2019 playlist in a dozen countries worldwide and received critical acclaim from both national publications and specialist music outlets in both the UK and USA.\n\nThe Sunday Times - \u201cKiller folk-rock melodies and chord progressions; lyrics rich with emotional intelligence, candour, self-awareness and bite and vocals of immediacy\u201d\n\nThe I \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment she strikes the first meaty chord of her new album, KT sounds visceral capturing the grit of her live shows\u201d\n\nThe Sun 4* \u2013 \u201cWAX provides a gritty collection of classic rock-pop\u201d\n\nSecond single, \u2018Human Being\u2019, was released in December 2018, accompanied by a self- directed video by Tunstall which was premiered on NYLON and features an 8-year-old black belt nunchuck talent Eccaia Sampson. KT says of the video: \u201cMy vision for the video was to create a mirror between a young, crazy- talented, bold little girl, and link that burgeoning energy to a band of warrioress women\u201d. The track was playlisted by BBC Radio 2.\n\nThe last few years have seen something of a creative rebirth for Tunstall. Upon relocating to the west coast of the USA, she was accepted as one of six annual fellows for the Sundance Film Institute\u2019s Composers Lab (hosted by George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch in Northern California) and has since scored music for short and feature films.\nShe has also been awarded the Inspirational Artist gong at the Women In Music Awards and was chosen as the first ever female Grand Marshal (following the likes of Sir Sean Connery) to lead April 2018\u2019s annual New York Tartan Week parade. In May 2018 she and Mike McCready, of legendary multi-million selling Pearl Jam, released a cover of Tom Petty\u2019s huge hit single \u2018I Won\u2019t Back Down\u2019 with proceeds going to Pearl Jam\u2019s Vitalogy Foundation.\n\nIn 2018, KT performed sold-out intimate headline shows across the UK and US and toured worldwide supporting acclaimed artists including Simple Minds, The Pretenders, Barenaked Ladies and Gary Barlow.\n\nSo far in 2019, KT has been on a headline tour across the UK and Europe with her all-female band, played at festivals all over the UK (including a headline set at Glastonbury and sets at Isle of Wight, HebCelt, Larmer Tree and Car Fest), toured across the US & Canada, supported Hall & Oates on their UK arena tour and played shows in Japan and China.\n\nBy the end of 2019, KT will have also played live dates in the Netherlands, Mexico and Brazil.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Shacar ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365098.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alternative R&b, Spiritual, Hip - Hop, R & B", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Shacar is a twenty-five year old Florida native who is NYC based started pursuing music a few years ago.

The Edmonton, Kentucky-based rock n\u2019 roll quartet Black Stone Cherry was raised on musical forefathers such as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and the Faces, among other 1970s staples, and, now, with its sixth album, Family Tree, BSC salutes its classic rock heritage and honors its legacy with a beast of a Southern rock n\u2019 roll album.\n\n\u201cWe caught divine intervention with this one,\u201d guitarist Ben Wells says with a good chuckle. \u201cWe hit a creative spark and tapped into a spirit and a fire we hadn\u2019t before.\u201d Drummer John Fred Young adds: \u201cFamily Tree showcases all of our collective musical influences and how we have taken those to create something that is truly our own unique Southern American Rock \u2018N Roll Sound.\u201d\n\nFor 17 years, Black Stone Cherry has put forth a new vicious breed of Southern rock, injecting youthful vitality and a myriad of fresh new influences into the beloved American rock tradition. To date, the band has released five critically acclaimed albums, and one well-received blues EP. Black Stone Cherry has also rocked 12,000-cap arena shows, topped the UK charts, and shared the stage with a diverse roster of superstars, including Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, M\u00f6torhead, and ZZ Top.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry came together in 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, eventually coalescing around the lineup of Chris Robertson, vocals and guitar; Ben Wells, guitar and vocals; Jon Lawhon, bass and vocals; and John Fred Young, drums. Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry.

Ever the optimist, Woody pleaded to Trump to \u201copen your doors\u201d and \u201crip out the strangling red tape\u201d that kept the apartment from embracing all races.\n\nProduced by Eliza\u2019s son Cisco Ryder Gilliland, the recording features artists from Eliza\u2019s regular band of beloved Austin musicians: Mike Hardwick (Jon Dee Graham, Jerry Jeff Walker, Charlie Sexton) on pedal steel, slide and various guitars, Chris Maresh (Eric Johnson) on bass, Bukka Allen (Alejandro Escovedo, Joe Ely, Terry Allen) on piano and keyboards, Warren Hood on fiddle, mandolinist Kym Warner (Green Cards) and producer Cisco Ryder Gilliland on drums, with cameo appearances by rising star Jaimee Harris, folksinger BettySoo and the WEWIM choir of Austin, a group co-founded by Eliza and singer Charlie Faye that supports up-and-coming female musicians in the community.\n\n-------------------\n\nEliza Gilkyson is a politically minded, poetically gifted singer-songwriter who has become one of the most respected musicians in folk and Americana music circles. The daughter of legendary songwriter Terry Gilkyson, Eliza entered the music world as a teenager, recording demos for her father. Since then she has released 20 recordings of her own, and her songs have been covered by such notables as Joan Baez, Bob Geldof, Tom Rush and Rosanne Cash.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated songwriter has appeared on NPR, Austin City Limits, Mountain Stage, eTown, XM Radio, Air America Radio and has toured worldwide as a solo artist and in support of Richard Thompson, Patty Griffin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Dan Fogelberg, as well as with the Woody Guthrie review, Ribbon of Highway-Endless Skyway, alongside the Guthrie Family, Jimmy Lafave, Slaid Cleaves, and special guests Pete Seeger, Jackson Browne and Kris Kristofferson. She has been inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame alongside such legends as Willie Nelson, Townes Van Zandt and Nanci Griffith and is an ongoing winner of the Austin Chronicle\u2019s various music awards, as well as Folk Alliance awards for Best Artist, Best Songwriter and Record of the Year.\n\nHer CD Land of Milk and Honey was nominated for a GRAMMY for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Eliza\u2019s meditative \u201cRequiem,\u201d written as a prayer for those who lost their lives in the devastating tsunami in Southeast Asia, was recorded by the nationally recognized choral group Conspirare, whose version was nominated for a Grammy and won the prestigious Edison Award in Europe. The song has become a standard in choir repertory the world over. Two of her songs appeared on Joan Baez\u2019s Grammy-nominated CD, Day After Tomorrow. In addition to touring in support of her previous release, Roses at the End of Time, in 2011 and 2012 Eliza and label-mates John Gorka and Lucy Kaplansky performed as \u201cFolk Super Trio\u201d Red Horse, a side project whose CD stayed for months at the top of the Folk Music Charts.

Eliza is currently touring her new album in the virtual fashion of the day - online - streaming a weekly show on Friday nights.\n\nGilkyson\u2019s music, in the classic folk music tradition, has always offered a vivid reflection of the times we live in with each song a window into a world of struggle and beauty in a culture she feels is \u201ccaught somewhere between collapse and reinvention.\u201d\n\nEliza is an active member of the Austin music and political community, including the environmental organization Save Our Springs (www.sosalliance.org),and she is a co-founder of www.5604manor.org, an Austin-based activist resource center that promotes political activism and community involvement around issues of race, patriarchy and global injustice.\n\nPraise for 2020\n\n\"The singer exudes a poetic wisdom few songwriters achieve, and a timeless quality to the album's secular hymns hearkens Leonard Cohen.\" \u2013 Austin Chronicle\n\nEliza Gilkyson is still creating music of richness and depth.\" \u2013 Spirituality & Health Magazine\n\nGilkyson manages to articulate what has remained -- to most of us -- inexpressible, hidden by our fear of forever, and has done so by willing vulnerability and accountability to become her gritty resolve.\" \u2013 All Music", "otherInfo": "Eliza's weekly Friday shows continue!

USA TODAY once said of Owen, \u201cHe developed a reputation for a singer willing to sacrifice technical perfection for a moment of authentic emotion.\u201d Each song in his catalogue is a glimpse into who Owen is as a person, and a testament to the joy that can only come from being yourself.\n\nHis newest single, \u201cHonesty,\u201d will be released in April 2020; it will be the first song from his forthcoming EP, Las Virginia, which he recently wrapped recording. \u201cI feel like with this new EP I am redefining who I am and showing the world that I\u2019m not just a singer, but an artist and songwriter with a perspective and story to tell.\u201d\n\nLas Virginia reflects Owen\u2019s journey of growth, as well as the combination of where he came from with who he is now. \u201cIt\u2019s all about my internal yin and yang, growing up in the east but now living in the west, and the battle of who I was taught to be versus who I am becoming.\u201d Owen has also coyly said, \u201cWhat happens in Las Virginia . . . ended up on this EP,\u201d in reference to a troubled romantic situation from his past. \u201cI\u2019m proud that I can freely sing about what I\u2019ve been through now. All of the lyrics on my last EP seemed like they were about a girl . . . but they definitely weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAuthenticity is a common theme within the native Virginian's music; past EPs delved deeply into themes of personal authenticity, self-confidence, and love. It took awhile to get there, however.\n\nFollowing his journey as a Season 14 Top 4 finalist on American Idol, Owen embarked on a 38-city tour as part of American Idols LIVE! He had garnered national recognition but felt like he was \u201cliving a lie.\u201d After finding himself in a serious relationship with a man, Owen made the brave decision to come out\u2014through his music, of course.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day in 2015, Owen released the music video for his first post-Idol single, \u201cCan't Fight It,\u201d along with an exclusive Billboard interview that publicly shared Owen's story as a gay man. In spite of some negative backlash, \u201cCan't Fight It\u201d went on to have over 1 million YouTube views and over half a million Spotify streams. Later that same year, after releasing his EP Air, he also earned the moniker of L.A. Music Award\u2019s \u201cRising Star.\u201d\n\nOwen\u2019s glowing collection of pop gems\u2014layered with textures of soul, R&B, and incandescent synth\u2014have earned attention from the likes of People Magazine, Huffington Post, USA Today, and Billboard. Recent singles have included: \u201cFlexin\u2019 My Vibe,\u201d with a feature appearance from the \u201cSelfie Kid,\u201d Ryan McKenna; \u201cTonight\u201d with a feature from Matillo; \u201cLike a Storm;\u201d and \u201cX,\u201d which Owen credits for inspiring the vibe of Las Virginia.\n\nOnstage, Owen has appeared with some of the most prolific and prominent recording artists, including Jamie Foxx, Ricky Martin, Boy George, and Frankie Grande. He toured with Postmodern Jukebox all over the United Kingdom, Ireland, and South America, and has sung the National Anthem for several major sporting events, including at games for the San Francisco 49ers, San Diego Chargers, Carolina Panthers, Arizona Cardinals, Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Clippers, and Phoenix Suns.\n\nAdditionally, Owen is honored to have performed at over sixty colleges nationwide and has been a featured performer at LGBT Pride Festivals in Columbus, Ohio, Richmond, Virginia, Louisville, Kentucky, and Los Angeles, California\u2014a particular honor for him. \u201cPeople experience and hear countless negative things every day. I think you can get really down when you\u2019re only hearing negative things about what people are saying about you, or what people are doing to you. I think that the best thing you can do is to be yourself and I hope that people find that message through my music.\u201d\n\nOther significant appearances and accolades have included being Elvis Duran's \u201cArtist of the Month\u201d (Jan/Feb 2018); performing his single \u201cGold\u201d on the TODAY Show; winning the \u201cRising Star\u201d award at the 2015 L.A. Music Awards; having \u201cGold\u201d featured as Nylon Magazine's \u201cBest Releases of the Week\u201d (Jan 2018); and receiving nearly 3 million YouTube views combined of his covers of \u201cIgnition\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Down\u201d with Postmodern Jukebox.\n\nWhether onstage, in the studio, or deep into the songwriting process, Rayvon Owen strives to entertain his listeners, while also creating an immersive and inspirational experience. \u201cI love singing about love, life experiences, and my journey growing up to be the person I am today.\u201d", "otherInfo": "American Songwriter presents: \u201cBehind The Mic\u201d with Rayvon Owen \u2014 a live-streaming performance & discussion live on Facebook\n\nfacebook.com/AmericanSongwriterMagazine"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gryphon Trio ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/urgntmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Shalewa Sharpe ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "THIS IS AN ONLINE EVENT"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jack Ingram ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6398564.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Around the time Jack Ingram started writing songs and performing, he was studying psychology at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \"Music and psychology come from the same place,\" he says. \"It's about studying why people tick.

Using moody electric guitars, horns, accordion, pedal steel and drums, Bridge 19 presents riffs that bend and blend genres. Touches of Americana, lively pop, vintage Nashville, Motown, singer-songwriter, and even disco float from song to song. You\u2019ll want to dance and sing along.\n\u201cIn the Afterglow\u201d is the third full-length album for a five-person band that has been entertaining live audiences and garnering critical acclaim since 2007, when Lucas and Cecil first began performing together.\n\nBridge 19 has shared stages with Brandi Carlile, Dr. Dog, Langhorn Slim, Sarah McLachlan, Asleep at the Wheel, Richard Thompson and more. The band has been booked at major music festivals, including MidPoint, RiverRoots, FreeFall, Lilith Fair and the International Folk Festival.\n\nBridge 19 has also been featured on nationally syndicated NPR and was ranked No. 1 in Thrillist\u2019s \u201cTop Louisville Bands You Need to Hear.\u201d \u201cRiding on a Wire,\u201d the band\u2019s last full-length release, was ranked No. 14 in Louisville AAA station WFPK\u2019s 100 Best Albums of 2015, and Bridge 19 was a finalist for Folk Artist of the Year at the 2015 Louisville Music Awards.\n\nLucas and Cecil\u2019s vocal harmonies have always been a cornerstone of Bridge 19, and they guide song after song on \u201cIn the Afterglow.\u201d Lucas and Cecil\u2019s soulful singing is reminiscent of female Americana duos like the Secret Sisters and the Watson Twins. Bridge 19\u2019s leaders aren\u2019t related by blood, though their effortless melodies might make you think they are.\n\nIn fact, Lucas and Cecil have been close friends for most of their lives, and that trust and comfort enables them to push past vulnerabilities and dig deep. Together, they craft songs that explore love, loss, addiction, heartache, anxiety, fear, joy and desire.\n\n\u201cWe know what each other is thinking or means at all times,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to write music with somebody, but I don\u2019t find it challenging to write with Audrey because we know each other so well.\u201d\nLong before they were band mates, Lucas and Cecil were teammates \u2013 beginning as 10-year-olds and continuing through high school on a traveling youth softball club.\n\nThey lost touch somewhat when they went to different colleges to play ball, but unbeknownst to each other at the time, they took parallel paths in becoming self-taught musicians, learning to play guitar and write songs. They discovered each other\u2019s work on MySpace \u2013 music\u2019s go-to digital platform at the time. After Cecil invited Lucas to practice with a band she was in, they hit it off and began performing as a duo.\n\nThey became Bridge 19 and have added band members over the years; the current lineup has been in place since 2014. In addition to Cecil on lead guitar and Lucas on rhythm guitar or handheld percussion, Bridge 19 features Joey Thieman (horns, accordion), Meg Samples (drums), Jeff Faith (bass). Over the years, they\u2019ve reached a new height in their art, a reckoning with self and society that can only come with age and experience.\n\nThe new album\u2019s first track and first single is #MeToo-inspired \u201cThe One,\u201d arguably Bridge 19\u2019s most overt social commentary. Lucas and Cecil wrote it after hearing the courageous courtroom statements of the survivors of serial sexual predator Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor. \u201cThe One\u201d contains haunting lyrics while using a pedal steel guitar and catchy drumbeat to combine sounds of Americana, vintage Nashville and pop.

R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out. I feel blessed to be able to write as much as I do. It gives me an opportunity to share some of myself with the fans.\u201d By Andrew Miller, Nashville Music Guide", "otherInfo": "Herrman & Herrman presents Curbside Live\n\nBrewster Street Ice House - South Side\n\nHerrman & Herrman, PLLC presents Curbside Live Music Series every Friday night!\n\nLive Music in the beer garden every Friday from 6-9 PM\n\nMay 8th - J.R.

Symphonic compositions flow from her fingertips effortlessly, with sound ranging from transcendental folk-pop to virtuosic instrumentals. Christie is often described as \u2018Michael Hedges meets Joni Mitchell and Dave Matthews,\u201d integrating melodic pop lyricism with catchy hooks and percussive, harmonic textures. As an Official Showcase Artist at Folk Alliance International consistently logging a number of major festivals, events, opera houses and theaters nationwide, Christie Len\u00e9e performs with radiant joy that awes crowds and inspires fellow musicians. She recently told Digital Journal that \"years ago, I set my intention to be an inspirational songwriter, though over time I've come to realize that inspiration comes in many forms. Talking about the dark and the light, the beauty and moments of pain are all forms of inspiration.\"\n\nChristie has shared stages with Tommy Emmanuel, Tim Reynolds (Dave Matthews Band), Andy McKee, and Amy Ray (Indigo Girls) to name a few, who have all raved about her talents (see below). Her first place victory in the acclaimed 2017 International Fingerstyle Guitar Championship has earned her featured coverage in Guitar Player Magazine, Acoustic Guitar Magazine, and Premier Guitar. She has released five albums, with \u201cSTAY\u201d one of three finalists for \u201cBest CD of 2016\u201d (Indie Acoustic Project Awards).

In 2018 Christie released an arrangement of Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d which garnered media attention across several Digital Publications. AXS.com's Jim Wood noted \"through the use of harmonics and tapping, Len\u00e9e's infectious style utilizes all parts of the guitar and combines elements of folk, rock and pop into one tasty and eclectic musical stew.\"\n\nWith over 12,000 fans on Facebook and nearly half a million plays on YouTube, Christie continues to spread the love of music through live performance, radio airplay and appearances on multiple television stations.

It\u2019s an effort philosopher Maurice Blanchot described as the anguish of writing: \u201cYou have to cross an abyss, and if you do not jump, you do not comprehend.\u201d Morris takes that leap to find universal truth by navigating sometimes opposing perspectives within moments that change lives. Morris beautifully warns us not to succumb to the fear of missing out that stands in the way of contentment on the album\u2019s defining moment, \u201cCheating Life, Living Death.\u201d Every dream is an invitation/ To leave your love up on the shelf/ When you walk out every evening/ Cheating life and living death.\"\n\nFor the sessions, Morris made the familiar pilgrimage to Adam Landry\u2019s home studio in Nashville. The longtime collaborators took their time and gave each song the opportunity to grow unaffected by outside influence except the magic that happens when two friends lock themselves in a smoky shed to make music, and a few pals stop by.\n\nWithin 11 powerful songs, the Athens rocker reveals scars and shares lessons from an indie-rock odyssey that has taken him around the world and back home to find himself a little older and closer to something like enlightenment.\n\nAnd just in time for a new journey to begin.", "otherInfo": "THIS FRIDAY 5/8, Georgia Theatre is collaborating with Creature Comforts and Tweed Recording to host a special \"Live From Over There\" event to benefit Nu\u00e7i's Space Garrie Vereen Memorial Emergency Relief Fund.\n\nThe live-stream will feature special performances by Futurebirds, Faye Webster and T.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899.

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra.\n\n\"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section.\n\nOne of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring. In the early \u201880s he began working in John Scofield\u2019s Quartet and a bass-less trio with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell. Steeped in the tradition of Ornette Coleman, Motian\u2019s recordings show off Lovano\u2019s avant-garde abilities. Scofield\u2019s Quartet straddled the line between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d. These recordings feature some of Lovano\u2019s best work.\n\nLovano has enduring musical partnerships with John Scofield and Paul Motian, having participated in some of their most noteworthy projects over the years.\n\nHe is currently a jazz artist on the international level. His live work, specifically Quarterts at the Village Vanguard, garnered a Down Beat \"Jazz Album of the Year\" award.

USA TODAY once said of Owen, \u201cHe developed a reputation for a singer willing to sacrifice technical perfection for a moment of authentic emotion.\u201d Each song in his catalogue is a glimpse into who Owen is as a person, and a testament to the joy that can only come from being yourself.\n\nHis newest single, \u201cHonesty,\u201d will be released in April 2020; it will be the first song from his forthcoming EP, Las Virginia, which he recently wrapped recording. \u201cI feel like with this new EP I am redefining who I am and showing the world that I\u2019m not just a singer, but an artist and songwriter with a perspective and story to tell.\u201d\n\nLas Virginia reflects Owen\u2019s journey of growth, as well as the combination of where he came from with who he is now. \u201cIt\u2019s all about my internal yin and yang, growing up in the east but now living in the west, and the battle of who I was taught to be versus who I am becoming.\u201d Owen has also coyly said, \u201cWhat happens in Las Virginia . . . ended up on this EP,\u201d in reference to a troubled romantic situation from his past. \u201cI\u2019m proud that I can freely sing about what I\u2019ve been through now. All of the lyrics on my last EP seemed like they were about a girl . . . but they definitely weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAuthenticity is a common theme within the native Virginian's music; past EPs delved deeply into themes of personal authenticity, self-confidence, and love. It took awhile to get there, however.\n\nFollowing his journey as a Season 14 Top 4 finalist on American Idol, Owen embarked on a 38-city tour as part of American Idols LIVE! He had garnered national recognition but felt like he was \u201cliving a lie.\u201d After finding himself in a serious relationship with a man, Owen made the brave decision to come out\u2014through his music, of course.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day in 2015, Owen released the music video for his first post-Idol single, \u201cCan't Fight It,\u201d along with an exclusive Billboard interview that publicly shared Owen's story as a gay man. In spite of some negative backlash, \u201cCan't Fight It\u201d went on to have over 1 million YouTube views and over half a million Spotify streams. Later that same year, after releasing his EP Air, he also earned the moniker of L.A. Music Award\u2019s \u201cRising Star.\u201d\n\nOwen\u2019s glowing collection of pop gems\u2014layered with textures of soul, R&B, and incandescent synth\u2014have earned attention from the likes of People Magazine, Huffington Post, USA Today, and Billboard. Recent singles have included: \u201cFlexin\u2019 My Vibe,\u201d with a feature appearance from the \u201cSelfie Kid,\u201d Ryan McKenna; \u201cTonight\u201d with a feature from Matillo; \u201cLike a Storm;\u201d and \u201cX,\u201d which Owen credits for inspiring the vibe of Las Virginia.\n\nOnstage, Owen has appeared with some of the most prolific and prominent recording artists, including Jamie Foxx, Ricky Martin, Boy George, and Frankie Grande. He toured with Postmodern Jukebox all over the United Kingdom, Ireland, and South America, and has sung the National Anthem for several major sporting events, including at games for the San Francisco 49ers, San Diego Chargers, Carolina Panthers, Arizona Cardinals, Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Clippers, and Phoenix Suns.\n\nAdditionally, Owen is honored to have performed at over sixty colleges nationwide and has been a featured performer at LGBT Pride Festivals in Columbus, Ohio, Richmond, Virginia, Louisville, Kentucky, and Los Angeles, California\u2014a particular honor for him. \u201cPeople experience and hear countless negative things every day. I think you can get really down when you\u2019re only hearing negative things about what people are saying about you, or what people are doing to you. I think that the best thing you can do is to be yourself and I hope that people find that message through my music.\u201d\n\nOther significant appearances and accolades have included being Elvis Duran's \u201cArtist of the Month\u201d (Jan/Feb 2018); performing his single \u201cGold\u201d on the TODAY Show; winning the \u201cRising Star\u201d award at the 2015 L.A.

It is a pure country voice through and through. Blessed with a Johnny Cash baritone and the wit of Jerry Reed, Ray displays both over the 11 songs on his fourth album, the self-titled Ray Scott. A mix of roadhouse foot-stompers, stone-cold country ballads and the sing-speak songs for which he\u2019s become known, Ray Scott flashes with the energy and verve that defined Ray\u2019s earlier hits \u201cMy Kind of Music\u201d and \u201cThose Jeans.\u201d\nBut the album is also a reintroduction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reboot\u2014or a Ray-boot, if you will,\u201d quips Ray, who dubbed his last album Rayality. \u201cIt is an evolution, but I think people will hear it and know it\u2019s the same guy from \u2018My Kind of Music\u2019 and \u2018Those Jeans.\u2019 Lyrically, I tend to say things a certain way. You can always tell it\u2019s me.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s good reason for that, aside from that rumbling voice. Save for a few trusted cowriters here and there, like Mark Stephen Jones, Tony Mullins and Brandy Clark, Ray prefers to write solo. In this era of five-plus writers collaborating on a single song, Ray is a true lone wolf.\n\u201cCollaboration is fun and some of my favorite things have been written with other people, but at the same time, if you can write by yourself, you should,\u201d Ray says. \u201cThere was a time in Nashville when people wrote alone. Some of my favorite old writers, the people who got me interested in doing this in the first place\u2014Harlan Howard and Bob McDill\u2014wrote alone.\u201d\nThe results of such a writing style are pure, unfiltered songs, the undiluted vision of the artist.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always recorded my own material because it\u2019s almost impossible for me to sell a song that someone else wrote. I was more or less made to tell stories through my own window\u2014and the window\u2019s pretty smudged sometimes,\u201d Ray laughs. \u201cBut if I can entertain myself, I feel like other people might be entertained as well.\u201d\nThe tracks on Ray Scott are certainly entertaining. These are story songs that, instead of just repeating a catch phrase over and over, actually go somewhere. \u201cPapa n Mama,\u201d a loping blues number, is the tale of a son who stops his father\u2014 permanently\u2014from abusing his mother, landing himself in the pen. \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Gonna Be You\u201d is a defiant kiss-off to a cheating lover, promising she\u2019ll never break this guy\u2019s heart again. The cinematic \u201cLeave This World,\u201d however, is the polar opposite: a love song of devotion elevated by Ray\u2019s Male Vocalist of the Year-worthy performance, proof that Ray\u2019s bread and butter isn\u2019t just in the spoken word.\nStill, there is magic in those recitation numbers, especially in \u201cTijuana Buzzkill.\u201d A true tale of a disastrous, if humorous, south-of-the-border adventure that ended with Ray and his buddy in jail, the track exemplifies Ray\u2019s gift for wry storytelling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just as much an art to recitation as there is singing. It\u2019s all in how you emote, your emphasis and how you tell a story,\u201d he says. And it helps if you have comic timing, which Ray does in spades. In songs like the hazy bonus track \u201cWhat Works for Willie\u201d and the take-one-for-the-team anthem \u201cThe Ugly One,\u201d he delivers the pay-off lines with the cadence of a comedian.\n\u201cThe songs end up being a little on the polarizing side,\u201d Ray admits. \u201cBut I love that. Everything I\u2019ve ever had any luck with was a song that made people turn their head and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s different\u2019 or \u2018That pisses me off.\u2019\u201d\nProduced by Dave Brainard (Brandy Clark\u2019s 12 Stories, Jerrod Niemann\u2019s Free the Music), Ray Scott excels in the details\u2014the swampy harmonica of lead-off track \u201cCookin\u2019\u201d; the mariachi horns of \u201cTijuana Buzzkill\u201d; and the hypnotic rhythm of the white-trash nursery rhyme \u201cWheels on the House.\u201d In the end, no two songs sound alike, and Ray cements himself as a deft performer, able to toggle between those funny tunes and serious fare like the staggering \u201cI Miss the Days.\u201d\nA bittersweet ballad about being young, \u201cI Miss the Days\u201d is a slice of nostalgia, both in subject matter and production. Sonically, it recalls the 1970s and \u201980s sound of country music.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we were going for. If you listen to an old Waylon Jennings record or something from that time period, a lot of those songs had a \u2018Luckenbach\u2019 vibe to them,\u201d says Ray, who agrees that today\u2019s country music frequently borrows some of the bombast of late \u201980s hard rock. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little more Waylon and a little less Warrant.\u201d\nIn the end, Ray Scott furthers Ray\u2019s identity as a modern day outlaw, not in image, but in his approach to the music industry.\n\u201cAfter all these years in Nashville I\u2019ve never been willing to compromise my artistic vision as far as writing goes or the way things are recorded and produced. I don\u2019t chase trends, which is not necessarily your quickest road to riches by any means,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to walk outside my trailer, look up at the sun and say, \u2018I did it the way I wanted.\u2019\u201d Ray stops to laugh. \u201cWhen the cops come to serve the warrant, at least I\u2019ll have my integrity\u2014integrity and a beer.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Yall join us for another mancave Jam this Friday on the Official Ray Scott Facebook page at 7:30PM cst!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The April Verch Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9057098.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fiddler, singer, and stepdancer April Verch knows how relevant an old tune can be. She was raised surrounded by living, breathing roots music\u2014her father\u2019s country band rehearsing; the lively music at church and at community dances; the tunes she rocked out to win fiddle competitions. She thought every little girl learned to stepdance at the age of three and fiddle at the age of six. She knew nothing else and decided early on that she wanted to be a professional musician.\n\nShe took that leap, and for over two decades has been recording and captivating audiences worldwide, exploring new and nuanced places each step of the way. On April 12, 2019, Verch will release her twelfth recording, Once A Day, via Slab Town Records. A followup to her 2017 career-\u00ad\u2010 spanning release The April Verch Anthology, this new album is a heartfelt homage to 1950s and 60s classic country.\n\nRecorded in Nashville by Bil VornDick and produced by Doug Cox, Once A Day features the talents of country veterans including steel guitarist Al Perkins (Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris), guitarist Redd Volkaert (Merle Haggard) and fiddler Kenny Sears (Mel Tillis, Grand Ole Opry). From the title track, a hit debut single for Connie Smith, to Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Woman Enough,\u201d and Webb Pierce\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Not Mine Anymore,\u201d the album is a dynamic crash course in one of Country Music\u2019s most influential time periods. Her admiration for these musicians and this iconic era is evident from start to finish. Void of contemporary gimmicks and over-\u00ad\u2010production, Verch revels in the history and lets the music speak for itself.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, making this album was not a choice. It was something I felt I had to do. It has been more daunting than any other project I\u2019ve embarked on, because these songs, these artists, the history of this music matters to me on the deepest level. It is a love letter and a thank you letter in one, to the artists, songwriters, musicians, and industry professionals who created, perhaps in some cases without even realizing it, an era of music that speaks to me in a way that no other music does. If someone hears a song on this album and that prompts them to look up and love the original that will be the highest compliment I could receive,\u201d explains Verch.\n\nWhile Verch is perhaps best known for playing traditional fiddle styles from her native Ottawa Valley, Canada, her performances extend into old-\u00ad\u2010time American and Appalachian styles and far beyond, for a well-\u00ad\u2010rounded tour-\u00ad\u2010de-\u00ad\u2010force of North Americana sounds. Verch and her fellow trio members pare down their arrangements, highlighting the simple pleasures of upright bass, guitar, clawhammer banjo, voices, fiddle, and stepping in intimate conversation. At the heart lie Verch\u2019s delicate voice, energetic footwork, and stunning playing. Sometimes she sings, steps and fiddles all at once, with apparent ease and precision. Verch is -\u00ad\u2010 as they say -\u00ad\u2010 a triple threat in performance, her live show a beautiful companion to her music: versatile, robust, and masterfully executed.\n\nVerch began her full time touring career in 2000 and has performed around the world, including festival, theatre and performing arts centre appearances in Canada, USA, China, Australia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Spain, Czech Republic and the United Arab Emirates. She also presents workshops, master classes, and lectures as part of her tours and at selected music camps.\n\nVerch won\u2019t be the one to tell you about her championship titles, nominations, and awards, or the fact that she was one of 6 fiddlers who represented the Canadian fiddle tradition to the world at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, as part of a segment called \"Fiddle Nation\u201d. Instead, in speaking with her, you\u2019ll hear about how passionate she is about sharing her music; in small gatherings in remote communities in Iqaluit, to large prestigious concert halls like Mozartsal in Vienna.\n\nEven as she plays with the tradition she inherited, Verch keeps the community-\u00ad\u2010fired celebratory side of her music at the forefront, honing a keen awareness of how to engage contemporary listeners. It\u2019s why Rolling Stone cited her \u201cOne of the 12 best things we saw at MerleFest in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as contemporary bluegrass has Alison Krauss as an ambassador, the Ottawa Valley has April Verch,\u201d said NPR\u2019s Marco Werman on \u201cThe World.\u201d And Verch never forgets the roots of her music, that connection to the people out there in the audience, on the dance floor, to the community sparked by a good song. \u201cIt\u2019s about joining together to celebrate everyday life, through music.

The EP, \u201cMaybe More,\u201d is the result of taking her personal stories and writing experience and adding in some of the top songwriters and producers in the business.\n\nA few years after creating \u201cMaybe More\u201d and the EP landing multiple nominations for the Hollywood Music and Media Awards and various other competitions, more stars aligned and after several trips back and forth from Nashville and many hours writing and recording, she finished her first full album, which includes the songs off of the \u201cMaybe More\u201d EP as well as seven new songs created with the help of the incredible Jeff Pardo (Lady Antebellum, Matthew West, Colton Dixon). Since its release, the album has received great reviews and has also received numerous award nominations.\n\nCurrently, Bethany is touring around Texas with her first band and showing her art to anyone who will listen. In the past few years she has performed hundreds of shows including a tour with High School Nation and \u201cDrake and Josh\u201d star Drake Bell, Six Flags Over Texas, Rodeo Austin, Goorin SXSW, Grapefest, and Berges Fest among others.

In between shows and appearances, she is working towards her Bachelor\u2019s Degree from Berklee School of Music Online.\n\nCurrently, Bethany is nominated for three Josie Music Awards.\n\nBethany works hard to make her music relatable, not just to other 20-year-old girls but to people of all ages and all walks of life. In addition to being relatable, it\u2019s important to her that no parent ever feels like they have to cover their child\u2019s ears at one of her shows.

The accomplished singer/songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist\u2014a true quadruple threat\u2014released her impactful and emotional debut album Symptoms last year, and it's only the beginning of her journey with a new single and more new music on the way.\n\nBorn and raised in Hawaii, the Los Angeles-based Crowe was practically brought into the world with music in her life: she started playing violin at the young age of three years old, and her father was a concert pianist alongside his career as an astronomer. \"My parents were very musical\u2014they met performing theater together,\" she explains. \"Music was a huge part of our family and my upbringing.\"\n\nAfter teaching herself how to sing while listening to Broadway musical recordings, Crowe eventually got accustomed to performing locally and accrued the confidence and motivation to try her hand at songwriting and music production, with formative influences that included Jewel and Alanis Morrissette. \"They had strong, empowering lyrics,\" she states. \"Jewel had this beautiful voice\u2014all she had to do is grab a guitar and tell her stories. That was mesmerizing to me. Alanis was all about raw, unapologetic emotion and power, and her lyrics were very dynamic while still retaining introspection.\"\n\nIn 2018, Crowe won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest for her song \"Breaking Things,\" which was co-written and co-produced with her partner and first songwriting collaborator Josh Anderson; a year later, she released her debut album Symptoms, the result of two and a half years of work with Anderson in Los Angeles on songs she'd originally written in her bedroom. \"It was my first chapter as a writer, producer, and artist,\" she states while discussing the album's origins. \"It was such a journey to have people around me and a team who could help guide me in this city.\"\n\nA deeply felt and expressive pop album, Symptoms was inspired by Lady Gaga's own approach to production and songwriting: \"She's a powerhouse performer. A lot of my production is inspired by her, along with songwriters like Sia and Taylor Swift\u2014strong women that are powerful, dynamic, and cathartic above all else.\"\n\nSymptoms' title track\u2014as well as the album as a whole\u2014draws from an abusive experience that took place before moving to the West Coast. \"After I went through that experience, my body went into shock and I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety,\" she recalls. \"It was about telling myself that everything was going to be okay\u2014and a musical diary that revealed the ways I was coping with what I'd been through.\"\n\nThe transformative \u201cChess Game,\u201d co-written by Kailey Shaffer, zeroes in on the struggles that young women in the music industry often face, as well as how to transcend and evolve amidst such struggles. As young women in our industry, we felt like we were tired of playing everyone else\u2019s games,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were inspired to write something uplifting\u2014an infectiously driven and empowering anthem in the face of adversity. The symbolism of the lyrics represents transformation, realizing your inner strength and having the courage to take back and own your true power.\u201d The song was an anthem and debuted in the Billboard Dance Charts.\n\n\"Each song is a different piece of a puzzle\u2014a symptom of who I am,\" Crowe continues. \"I took my traumatic experiences and turned them into these fun pop songs to help me get through what I've experienced.\" The latest single from Symptoms, \"Sky Is Falling,\" is particularly close to Crowe's heart; the epic, wide-open ballad finds her drawing from the pain and perseverance of her father's passing. \"It's my most personal song\u2014it encompasses all the things at the core of what I've gone through,\" she explains. I never had the chance to get any closure with him about what had happened to me, and I never got to say goodbye. All my anxiety turned into depression when he died. Because he studied the stars, the title itself is a double meaning. My world was crashing down around me, but I also wanted to make sure the song was uplifting and hopeful.\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for the single is next up, and in Crowe's words, the space-themed clip focuses on \"Finding a connection with that feeling after you experience loss\u2014with that person who may not even be there in the physical form anymore.\" What's next? More new music, starting with a duet with frequent collaborator Nick Mair, \"Can't Find Love\"\u2014as well as continuing to live through the highs and lows of existing, and helping her listeners do the same. \"A lot of things are hard to talk about that we go through, but we can all laugh and cry about it,\" she states. \"It's about letting yourself feel those emotions and coming out stronger from it\u2014feeling more self-assured about who you are.\"", "otherInfo": "Friday May 8th at 6pm Pacific\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ISRROCKSLIVE\n\nYou can help Indie Star Radio by becoming a Patron!

Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "jose madero ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617872.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Basler ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10305069.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock, Alternative", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Basler is the melding of the styles of Gritty Grunge, Slithering Shred, Glitzy Glam and Psychedelic Pop.

A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008. Features tracks with Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Saigon, amongst others.", "otherInfo": "Live on The Roots Youtube"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Todd Park Mohr ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6196005.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Todd Park Mohr is the lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter for the rock band Big Head Todd and the Monsters. Founded in Colorado in 1986, Big Head Todd and the Monsters (BHTM) catapulted out of the mountain states and into the national spotlight. With chart-topping singles and engaging live shows, BHTM has sold over three million albums and packed major venues worldwide, including selling out their home state's historic Red Rocks Amphitheatre seven times, most recently in 2012. Most importantly, they've done it the old-fashioned way: with excellent songwriting, scorching guitar and fearless genre melding. The band's last release was 2011's \"100 Years Of Robert Johnson.\" Joined by special guests including B.B. King, Charlie Musselwhite, Hubert Sumlin, David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards and more, BHTM paid tribute to the blues legend both in the studio and on the road. The band recently recorded a new studio album in Chicago, set for release in 2014, with producer Steve Jordan (Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens) and engineer Niko Bolas (Neil Young, Warren Zevon). On 2012's \"Last Summer on Earth Tour,\" BHTM played some of the nation's biggest arenas alongside Barenaked Ladies and Blues Traveler. In August 2012, the band presented its inaugural Ride Festival in Telluride, CO. The lineup included Ben Harper, Lucinda Williams and The Lumineers, among others. At the 2nd Annual Ride Festival in July the lineup featured David Byrne and St. Vincent, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Cake and more. BHTM are giving their fans exactly what they want in 2013: cross-country stops at intimate theaters, and two full sets every night. This summer BHTM is headlining the inaugural LP Tour which recently included a show at the baseball stadium Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins. The longevity of BHTM's career is a testament to the quality of the music. More than a quarter of a century later, fans are still convinced that the best is yet to come.
