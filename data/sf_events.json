Mystic shaman, protest singer, revolutionary hero, everyday metalhead, furious consumer of heavy music of all shades, husband, father, leader, songwriter\u2026 Cavalera reigns as the adoptive tribal chief of a generation of fans, stretching from the roughest slums of South America to the coldest confines of Russia. Anywhere that people are disenfranchised, the songs of SOULFLY serve as their anthems.\n\n\n\nArmed with Cavalera\u2019s four-stringed guitars, unmistakable growl and instantly recognizable riffage, the muddy tones and constant rhythmic bounce of SOULFLY has retained its gritty edge while pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in metal. \u00bbSavages\u00ab represents a career-defining moment, solidifying the lineup with longtime lead guitarist Marc Rizzo (who has been in SOULFLY almost as long as Max was in SEPULTURA), bassist Tony Campos (Static X, Ministry, Prong) and Max\u2019s 21 year-old Zyon, who splits his time between drumming in LODY KONG and now SOULFLY.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of the things that make SOULFLY killer are combined in Savages,\u201d Max declares.\n\n\n\n\u00bbSavages\u00ab melds the most brutal, the heaviest and overall the most vibrant components that made up each record in SOULFLY\u2019s diverse catalog. By Max\u2019s own account, \u00bbSavages\u00ab is possessed of the tribal groove of the first two SOULFLY albums, particularly in songs like \u2018Bloodshed\u2019, \u2018Ayatollah of Rock \u2018N\u2019 Rolla\u2019 and \u2018Master of Savagery\u2019. But there\u2019s also the thrash metal that was found on DARK AGES and OMEN; whereas the CAVALERA CONSPIRACY records contain short, punky bursts, the new SOULFLY record gets into the epic length territory of early METALLICA. The death metal vibe of SOULFLY\u2019s \u00bbEnslaved\u00ab emerges in songs like \u2018Fallen\u2019 and \u2018Cannibal Holocaust\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cI really like the name \u00bbSavages\u00ab. I like single words that sound powerful, like \u2018Primitive\u2019, \u2018Roots\u2019, \u2018Arise\u2019,\u201d Max explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about the human condition right now. We have the Internet and we\u2019re working on missions to Mars, but we are still decapitating each other and blowing up marathons. We\u2019re still savages. Even with technology and how far we\u2019ve come in the world, our spirit is still that of a savage.\u201d\n\n\n\nA trailblazing pioneer and musician with millions of albums sold who nevertheless retains boundless street cred due to his grimy, raw and undeniable authenticity; Max Cavalera is one of the most prolific artists the realm of heavy music has ever known. There\u2019s CAVALERA CONSPIRACY, which reunited Max with his brother and former bandmate, Igor Cavalera. There was the brutal attack of NAILBOMB, Max\u2019s collaboration with Alex Newport from FUDGE TUNNEL, which included members of DEAD KENNEDYS, FRONT LINE ASSEMBLY, BIOHAZARD and NEUROSIS on-stage. There\u2019s his forthcoming band with members of THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN, MASTODON and THE MARS VOLTA. Of course, there\u2019s Max\u2019s unassailable work as SEPULTURA\u2019s founder, leading the Brazilian band from their badass lo-fi beginnings, through their era of sophisticated thrash classics, up through the cultural landmark that is \u2018Roots\u2019.\n\n\n\nSOULFLY began almost instantaneously after his departure from the band he founded. The eponymously titled debut \u00bbSoulfly\u00ab sold over 500,000 copies in the United States alone, further expanding upon the tribal foundation of \u2018Roots\u2019 with percussive instrumentation, forays into esoteric sounds and multiple guest performers. Across the seven albums and never-ending tours that followed, Max worked with a who\u2019s-who of the heavy music scene as band mates, guest musicians and touring members, including guys from SLIPKNOT, SLAYER, MEGADETH, DEFTONES, RADIOHEAD, STONE SOUR, CYPRESS HILL, MACHINE HEAD, DEVILDRIVER, FEAR FACTORY, MORBID ANGEL, THROWDOWN, S.O.D., SKINDRED, BORKNAGAR, WILL HAVEN and CATTLE DECAPITATION, among others.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Max\u2019s own self-production, a number of important producers have lent their skills to SOULFLY, including \u00bbRoots\u00ab producer Ross Robinson (KORN, AT THE DRIVE-IN), Toby Wright (Ozzy Osbourne, SLAYER), Andy Sneap (MEGADETH, KILLSWITCH ENGAGE), ex-SOULFLY guitarist Logan Mader (FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH, GORJIA) and Zeuss (HATEBREED, SUICIDE SILENCE) and Terry Date (PANTERA, DEFTONES).\n\n\n\nCavalera asked Date, who had mixed for SOULFLY in the past, to produce the new album. Once studio time with the legendary producer was on the calendar, Max kicked into high gear with the material. Max and Zyon worked on the songs that would comprise \u00bbSavages\u00ab at home. \u201cZyon came up to me and said, \u2018Give me a shot. I\u2019ll play on the record for you. I won\u2019t let you down,\u201d explains the elder Cavalera. \u201cI went into a room with him to jam and it felt great. So I said, \u2018Fuck yeah, let\u2019s do it!\u201d\n\n\n\nGenerally on a SOULFLY album, the drummers would learn the songs in the studio, based on demo recordings from Max. This time, Max had the luxury of working out the songs at home with Zyon. \u201cWe jammed every single day for a month. He knew 90% of the material already when we got into the studio. It reminded me of recording the old Sepultura stuff, like Arise and Chaos A.D., Igor knew exactly what he was going to do before we went into the studio. This was very similar.\u201d\n\n\n\nCavalera says he must\u2019ve written at least 1,000 riffs specifically for \u00bbSavages\u00ab. \u201cThe killer riff is what hooks the whole song together,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me the writing process is about finding the most killer riffs possible. It's a battle; sometimes I struggle with the guitar for hours. You have to throw it down on the floor and take a break. Come back a few hours later. \u2018Let\u2019s try this again, motherfucker!\u2019 Grab it again and go to battle, go to war with the guitar until you get the right riffs.\u201d\n\n\n\nMax points to BLACK SABBATH\u2019s \u2018Symptom of the Universe\u2019 as one of the penultimate riffs of all time, citing SABBATH\u2019s Tony Iommi and METALLICA frontman James Hetfield as among the riff-masters he most admires. \u201cI think of riff making as an art-form. I take it really seriously. I think it deserves more attention. It has such value.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking of riffs, Rizzo came into the band a decade ago and his love of thrash metal, death metal and collaborative spirit has energized Max ever since. \u201cWhen Marc entered Soulfly, it was a drastic change. He's the guitar player I've been looking for my whole life. Andreas [Kisser] and I really clicked when we worked together. I never had that again after that. We had other guys that were cool, but it was never 100% there. When Marc came in, I found it! We\u2019ve developed a great bond since.\u201d Rizzo particularly shines on the opening track on Savages, \u2018Bloodshed.\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s stuff all over the song \u2013 clean guitars, feedback \u2013 he just makes the song better.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampos has a lengthy resume in the world of metal and Max says they bonded over their shared Latino heritage, among other things. \u201cI had this idea about this guy Vargas, a Venezuelan cannibal, they call him \u2018El Comegente.\u2019 He\u2019s the Hannibal Lecter of the Andes. We both read about it. Tony sings some of it in Spanish and I sing in Portuguese. He\u2019s a great bass player too, fucking amazing. Killer bass tones, distortion, all balls-out metal. He keeps this shit real heavy, great tone. It\u2019s great recording with guys who know what they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t have to ask if they know.\u201d\n\n\n\nMax acknowledges the inherent risk in putting a 21 year-old behind the kit for such an important record, but it was a risk he absolutely wanted to take. \u201cTo have my son drumming on the album, that's killer. I like risks. I like to start shit up and see what happens. Even if I fail, at least I knew I tried. Rather than knowing I didn't try at all. To me, that's the bigger failure. It took a little bit of courage to put my son on it. I came to the studio and told Terry there was a young drummer who doesn\u2019t play to a click. Terry knew what to do and Zyon did great. The drums sound amazing.\u201d\n\n\n\nLike all things Max Cavalera, does SOULFLY\u2019s \u00bbSavages is a family affair. Not only does it mark Zyon\u2019s recorded debut with the band, but one of Max\u2019s other kids throws down some vocals in the opening track, \u2018Bloodshed\u2019. \u201cMy son Igor has a killer punk rock voice that reminds me of the old CORROSION OF CONFORMITY days,\u201d Max says. \u201cThe chorus has this old punk style riff, almost like a MISFITS type riff. His voice is killer.\u201d\n\n\n\nLike every SOULFLY album, \u00bbSavages\u00ab contains an impressive guest list comprised of veterans and up-and-comers. CLUTCH\u2019s Neil Fallon turns up on \u2018Ayatollah of Rock \u2018N\u2019 Rolla\u2019, the title of which was inspired by Mel Gibson\u2019s classic Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior movie. Jamie Hanks from I DECLARE WAR brought his high and low deathcore vocals to \u2018Fallen\u2019, a death metal oriented song Max says is in the vein of CANNIBAL CORPSE.\n\n\n\nMitch Harris from NAPALM DEATH contributed vocals to \u2018K.C.S.\u2019 Harris has been around the Cavaleras long enough that there are videos of him changing Zyon\u2019s diapers when SOULFLY\u2019s new drummer was just one month old. \u201cMitch came to the studio just to hang out during a day off from tour,\u201d Max explains. \u201cI'm like, \u2018You ready to sing some shit on this record?\u2019 I put him on the spot. He's like, \u2018Right now?\u2019 I said, \u2018Fuck yeah, let's do it!\u2019 There was one point where we were recording together where he did a scream and I saw his eyeball popping out of his face like a cartoon. I was like, \u2018Dude that was the most metal thing I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nMax continues to consume new music from bands like NAILS, MAN MUST DIE, TRIGGER THE BLOODSHED and I DECLARE WAR, even as he revisits seminal material from METALLICA, SLAYER, C.O.C. and the like, and indulges his penchant for world music, and gets his hands in his other projects and collaborations. It all adds up to a singular, distinct, straightforward and riff-heavy machine known as SOULFLY.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Mike Annuzzi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6867067.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Songwriter, Adult Contemporary, Singer", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "If you spent just a few minutes with Mike Annuzzi, you would become aware that his positivity towards life is contagious.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE.

He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Even with a few hits in the bag, the search takes time, and it might be a few laps around the sun before things get dialed in \u2013 but when that happens it\u2019s like a switch is flipped.\nHeading into his second album for Big Loud Records, aptly titled Laps Around the Sun, that quest for self discovery was heavy on Chris Lane\u2019s mind. Two whirlwind years of chart toppers and jam-packed shows had gone by for the breakout country talent, but the North Carolina native still felt restless. He found himself looking back to his early days, and back to the reasons he fell in love with music in the first place.\n\u201cI had a moment where I played a show with Kenny Chesney,\u201d the lifelong country fan explains. \u201cIt was a festival right on the beach, and I watched him do his thing and I watched the crowd, and there was just something special about that night. I hadn\u2019t seen him in a long time, and the way people connected to what he was doing ... I had one of those moments like \u2018Man, I really want my music to do that.\u2019\u201d\nWith Girl Problems, the 2016 album that launched Lane as one of Nashville\u2019s most exciting new artists, the singer-songwriter got a taste of that connection. Its red hot romantic edge led to back-to- back, Gold-certified singles (\u201cFix\u201d and \u201cFor Her\u201d) and the first Country Radio #1 of his career, propelling the set to a Top 10 debut and sending Lane on tour with superstars like Florida Georgia Line, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill \u2013 all while helping him rack up 400 million digital streams worldwide, network TV appearances, and more.\nBut with Laps Around the Sun, this rising star had a bigger, bolder picture in mind, aiming for tunes \u201ceverybody can love, and everybody can feel.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain vibe to this album,\u201d Lane says, describing the serene confidence behind his new brand of modern country. Romance is still a big part of the equation, but now his stories dig deeper \u2013 somehow feeling both personal and universal at the same time. And instead of being lit by streetlights and neon, each song basks in the golden rays of a summer afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a change for me this time around,\u201d Lane says. \u201cBut this is what I truly love.\u201d\nProduced once again by studio ace Joey Moi (FGL), Laps Around the Sun feels more organic, building off the sandy arrangements of artists like Chesney and Billy Currington with an added touch of new- school cool. Lane and Moi recorded with a live band for the first time, fleshed out melodies on guitars rather than computer screens, and eased Lane\u2019s vocal into its timeless natural register.\nFourteen tracks written by hitmakers like Rhett Akins, Ashley Gorley, Hillary Lindsey and The Warren Brothers made the cut \u2013 and in an important lesson learned while Lane put his \u201claps\u201d in on tour, they were all chosen based on meaning and personal connection, not purely on energy or feel.\nThe album\u2019s first single, \u201cTake Back Home Girl\u201d (featuring Tori Kelly) marks Lane\u2019s coming of age. It builds on the sultry swagger of Girl Problems, but he and the Grammy-nominee aren\u2019t singing about a steamy downtown hookup. Instead, the track reveals who Lane really is \u2013 a true country boy with deeply rooted family values \u2013 becoming Lane\u2019s third Gold-certified single in a row.\nThe patient \u201cI Don\u2019t Know About You\u201d charts a similar course \u2013 a hard-crushing, swollen-hearts anthem sure to inspire stadium wide sing alongs \u2013 while \u201cNumber One\u201d takes a soulful look at regret, and \u201cWithout You\u201d adds Danielle Bradbery for some sun-kissed romantic harmony.\nOn \u201cDrunk People,\u201d Lane\u2019s good-natured sense of humor shines bright. The grinning mid-tempo is just smooth enough to not aggravate a hangover headache, but edgy enough to admit that drunk people do dumb things ... like get back together. \u201cThat song is me to a \u2018T,\u2019\u201d Lane says with a laugh. \u201cEvery time I have one to many tequila drinks, I think I\u2019ve gotta FaceTime every girlfriend I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nHe throws some sunny shade on \u201cNew Phone, Who\u2019s This,\u201d a sly, smile-inducing strutter. And likewise, \u201cFishin\u2019\u201d feels as fun and refreshing as a secret honey hole on a hot day. Country to the core, its lyrics recall the innocence of young love \u2013 and the nostalgia of the genre\u2019s most iconic hits. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a great little summer song,\u201d Lane says. \u201cAnd for some reason, it lives in that same place that \u2018Mayberry\u2019 by Rascal Flatts does for me.\u201d\nMeanwhile, \u201cHero\u201d reveals the man Lane has always been, and the artist he\u2019s become. A slow, heartfelt ballad with an openly religious theme of personal conviction, Lane says he knew recording it could be risky, \u201cbut at the same time, there has never been a song that is more true to me.\u201d\n\u201cI really prayed that I would get the song,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if it will ever be a single or anything like that, but it speaks to my heart.\u201d\nStill, Lane named the album Laps Around the Sun for a reason, and the title track reflects how he feels about his journey to the here and now. Supremely relaxed, soulful, and full of mature optimism, it describes a hand-in-hand adventure which could be about Lane and the girl of his dreams ... or it could be about Lane and country fans. Either way, he promises to keep on moving forward, together.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know we\u2019ll never be done / Taking laps around the sun,\u201d goes the chorus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d Lane admits. \u201cWith my first record, I was trying to figure out exactly what kind of sound I wanted to have, and now I know. I know what I truly love and what kind of artist I want to be. My goal was to make sure anyone who hears this album finds a song they can relate to.

Now \u201cSpyboy\u201d ups the ante by digging deeper into the sound of New Orleans culture and giving it a modern twist. The disc\u2019s largely original material takes advantage of the band\u2019s new horn section to highlight the musicians\u2019 personal ties to the street music of their hometown. \u201cWe wanted to take the roots of what we love about New Orleans brass band music and Mardi Gras Indian music and then voice it in our own way,\u201d says the group\u2019s drummer and founder, Joe Gelini.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition began when African-American men first marched in Native American dress through the streets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras day. The tradition, which includes a host of songs shared among the various tribes, has been kept alive for over a century and today is as vital as ever. Mardi Gras Indians have influenced the biggest names in New Orleans music: The Meters, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, the Neville Brothers, Trombone Shorty and others. The most prominent Mardi Gras Indian today is Monk Boudreaux, the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe, and his grandson J\u2019Wan Boudreaux (who holds the position of Spyboy in the tribe) is stepping up with Cha Wa to propel their culture forward.\n\nJ\u2019Wan joined the group when he was still in high school. At the time, Gelini, then a recent Berklee School of Music grad, had been playing drums for Boudreaux\u2019s grandfather, having learned the traditional Mardi Gras Indian beats from original Wild Magnolias bass drummer Norwood \u201cGeechie\u201d Johnson at Sunday night Indian practices in Uptown New Orleans. As the band evolved, J\u2019Wan emerged as the front man. On \u201cSpyboy,\u201d Boudreaux\u2019s vocals (with support from Thaddeus \u201cPeanut\u201d Ramsey\u2019s smooth-voiced Indian style), the booming, funked-up sound of the band\u2019s new four-part horn section, and Gelini\u2019s mix of second line grooves and soulful Indian rhythms have all combined to kindle a new fire in Cha Wa\u2019s ever-developing sound.\n\nAlthough \u201ccha wa\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re comin\u2019 for ya\u201d in Indian vernacular, Boudreaux says the album \u201cSpyboy\u201d is \u201cCha Wa all around\u201d for a different reason. With songwriting contributions to \u201cSpyboy\u201d from band members Joe Maize, Thaddeus \u2018Peanut\u2019 Ramsey, Ari Teitel and Clifton \u2018Spug\u2019 Smith, along with J\u2019Wan and Gelini, Cha Wa ignites an entire new generation with contemporary anthems set ablaze by its high-flying ensemble. Says Boudreaux, \u201cEveryone put their minds together to make this music. Everyone had input on at least one song. And the whole band has a different type of connection these days. Everybody\u2019s bonded now. Everybody\u2019s just having fun\u201d.\n\n\nThe track \u201cGet On Out the Way\u201d -- with its loose, \u201870s funk rhythm, tight horn parts and deep, bouncing sousaphone -- brings that celebratory vibe to life by spiking a traditional Indian phrase with a fast-moving brass band twist.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more serious, social message at work in Cha Wa\u2019s music. Gelini and Monk wrote \u201cVisible Means Of Support\u201d about Monk\u2019s experience with the \u201850s-era Jim Crow vagrancy law used primarily to arrest African-American men. On the J\u2019Wan-penned, big beat-centric \u201cChapters,\u201d the singer tackles more contemporary issues, in this case, the internal struggles he faced while being raised by a single mom.\n\nThe mellow, piano and vocals-only \u201cJ\u2019Wan\u2019s story\u201d sees him taking a different approach to bridging the gap between beauty and harsh reality in New Orleans when he explains, spoken word-style, the basics about how and why Mardi Gras Indian culture developed.\n\n\u201cWe dress up in the Indian suits to pay homage to the Native American Indians, because around the time of slavery, they were the first ones to take us in,\u201d he says, elaborating on the song. \u201cEverything on our suits is handmade -- the beads, the patterns, we sew together pieces of fabric and make the panels, we make the boots -- everything.\u201d\n\nNot that you need a firm understanding of Indian or brass band culture to feel the dance-ready vibrations of Cha Wa\u2019s new music. \u201cIt\u2019s dance music so I think people are attracted to it. Even if people have no idea what the history is, it\u2019s automatically infectious,\u201d Gelini explains. \u201cJ\u2019wan\u2019s the next generation,\u201d the drummer adds. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping this flame lit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "476 1st St E, Sonoma, CA 95476", "Artist": "Isabella Rossellini", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9830326.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.456434, 38.292238], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sebastiani Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Pier 23 The Embarcadero, San Francisco, CA 94111", "Artist": "WE ARE THE KIND BAND", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9303945.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.39661, 37.797878], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Folk, Blues, Bluegrass, Rock, Alt-Country, Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Pier 23 Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "WE ARE THE KIND is an Indie Folk band from the historic North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, California...We play local shows every week around the City & broader Bay Area....Also got a chance recently to play on the radio in Nashville at the legendary 3rd & Lindsley club this summer as part of the WMOT \u201cFinally Friday\u201d series showcasing original Roots & Americana music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "476 1st St E, Sonoma, CA 95476", "Artist": "Isabella Rossellini", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9830326.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.456434, 38.292238], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sebastiani Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2636 San Bruno Ave, San Francisco, CA 94134", "Artist": "Matt Jaffe", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8945081.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.404158, 37.728262], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Rock, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Ferment Drink Repeat Brewing Co.", "moreBioInfo": "Matt Jaffe is a 24 year old rock & roll singer/songwriter from San Francisco.

It\u2019s a boundary-breaking, multicolored genre of his very own \u2014 which draws upon the rawness and storytelling abilities of his two biggest musical influences, Johnny Cash and Outkast. His debut EP, Blanco Brown, showcases the full range of its creator, who juggles multiple roles as the project\u2019s songwriter, producer, vocalist, visionary, and multi-instrumentalist.\n\nYears before he rose up the ranks as a Grammy-nominated engineer and major-label solo artist, and one of Billboard\u2019s \u201c7 Country Acts to Watch in 2019\u201d Blanco\u2014 grew up in two very different worlds, both in the state of Georgia, splitting his time between the city projects and the rural countryside. During the school year, he\u2019d spend his months in Atlanta, where the crime that filled his neighborhood was offset by the love and musical connection shared by his family. Every summer, he\u2019d head out of town temporarily moving in with relatives in the small rural town of Butler, GA.\n\nDuring those summers in Butler, the soundtrack that had filled his days back home in Atlanta \u2014 the R&B harmonies he\u2019d sing with his brothers; the rap he\u2019d hear blasting from the cassette players in passing cars; the gospel music he\u2019d howl every Sunday morning in church \u2014 gave way to the laidback, rootsy sounds of Johnny Cash songs and Bobby Blue Bland records. It was there, far away from city life, that Blanco became a fan of Country music. As each summer drew to an end, though, he\u2019d head back to the city, leaving behind the twangy sounds of Butler and returning once again to the projects of Atlanta.\n\nThose two worlds come together with Blanco Brown, an EP that strikes a balance between Blanco\u2019s contrasting backgrounds. A mix of countrified influences and street-smart lingo, the EP finds Blanco dressing up his rapid-fire lyrics and melodic hooks with layers of lap steel, thumping kick drum, harmonica, spoons, tambourine, banjo, synthesizers, 808 percussion, guitar, and plenty of vocal harmonies. The result is a debut EP that\u2019s both urban and rural, blending the sounds of Blanco\u2019s diverse upbringing into the world\u2019s very first trailer-trap project.\n\nBlanco Brown also represents a triumph over adversity. A childhood outcast who spent most of his youth in the hood, Blanco learned to channel his emotions into art at a young age. He drew. He sang. He wrote songs. Years later, he still sees colors whenever he makes music. The songs on Blanco Brown represent a mix of darkness and light, balancing the aggressive, hard-edged narratives of songs like \u201cCountry Time\u201d with upbeat, dance-ready songs like \u201cThe Git Up.\u201d It\u2019s a vivid, vibrant sound \u2014 one that shines a light on Blanco\u2019s loving personality, challenging upbringing, and boundless creativity.\n\nGluing the mix together in Blanco\u2019s voice and detailed storytelling, with each song spinning true-life tales of poverty, relationships, the hood, and the journey to overcome whatever obstacles stand between you and your dream. Although most of those stories come from Blanco\u2019s own experience, they help weave a more universal picture.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think of the sound as being genre-breaking,\u201d he says. \u201cI think of it as being culture-bonding. If you listen to the messages of these songs, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s about the things we go all through as humans, not about race.\u201d\n\nLike many of his songs, \u201cCountry Time,\u201d with its hard-hitting hip-hop bounce and bluegrass-inspired outro, was tracked on Blanco\u2019s laptop, while \u201cDon\u2019t Love Her\u201d was built upon a voice memo that originated on his cell phone. Other songs were created in more traditional studios \u2014 the kind of place that Blanco already knew well, given the years he\u2019d spent working with musicians from across the spectrum. Blanco Brown may be Blanco\u2019s first release as a solo artist in his own right, but he\u2019s no newcomer. Instead, he\u2019s a well-rounded veteran of the recording studio, with his eyes now set on the stage. Over the years Blanco worked as a vocal producer with top name artists like Fergie, Childish Gambino, Chris Brown and Kane Brown to name a few. He also wrote songs for big names like Monica in addition to working as a background singer.\n\n\u201cThis album accentuates one side of what I went through, I can\u2019t forget the hood,\u201d says Blanco, who writes compellingly about his youth on songs like \u201cGhett Ol Memories.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t start out trying to make Country music, but these are the sounds I love\u2014and always keep coming back to time and time again. I don\u2019t believe in people being trailer trash, either, so I want to put a good connotation on that word. Making trailer-trap music really feels liberating to me, because I want to bring people together. That\u2019s what this music stands for: unity. It\u2019s multiple influences and sounds and styles, all coming together.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "853 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Carpool Tunnel", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9735636.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421068, 37.759319], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Modern Indie Surf Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Amnesia", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1500 Jefferson St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Jack Pollard", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8832271.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.292528, 38.301454], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz Blues and R&B", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Napa Senior Center", "moreBioInfo": "As an entertainer and a showman, Jack brings a lifetime of experience to the stage.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 7 PM SHOW: 7:30 PM\nPremier Seating + Meet and Greet Available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Junior Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Ryan Pollie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9056317.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Alternative", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club Crystal Cavern", "moreBioInfo": "Music by Ryan Pollie\nhttps://twitter.com/LAPDmusic\nhttps://soundcloud.com/LAPDmusic", "otherInfo": "Doors 7pm\nTickets $12\nRyan Pollie with Stephen Steinbrink, Half Stack, and Meernaa (solo)"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Ren Geisick, Vocalist", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8301505.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Americana", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SOMA Airbnb Experience", "moreBioInfo": "Bay Area-based vocalist Ren Geisick sings with radiant energy and a passion for storytelling.

The band consisted of lead vocalist/guitarist Julia Shapiro, bassist Annie Truscott, drummer Gretchen Grimm, and guitarist Lydia Lund. The group quickly integrated irreverent humor into its seemingly serious musical presence. Apart from witty and cutting lyrical content, the band named its first locally circulated demo recordings Fuck Chastity Belt and later shot press photos that portrayed Shapiro wearing a chastity belt made out of a raw steak. They continued this trend when releasing their proper debut, No Regerts, in 2013, subtly but intentionally misspelling \"No Regrets\" as one might on a horribly, ironically botched tattoo. The band toured heavily in support of No Regerts, and returned in early 2015 with sophomore album Time to Go Home on their new label home of Hardly Art Records. Chastity Belt traveled to Portland, Oregon to record fresh material with producer Matthew Simms in the summer of 2016.

Now \u201cSpyboy\u201d ups the ante by digging deeper into the sound of New Orleans culture and giving it a modern twist. The disc\u2019s largely original material takes advantage of the band\u2019s new horn section to highlight the musicians\u2019 personal ties to the street music of their hometown. \u201cWe wanted to take the roots of what we love about New Orleans brass band music and Mardi Gras Indian music and then voice it in our own way,\u201d says the group\u2019s drummer and founder, Joe Gelini.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition began when African-American men first marched in Native American dress through the streets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras day. The tradition, which includes a host of songs shared among the various tribes, has been kept alive for over a century and today is as vital as ever. Mardi Gras Indians have influenced the biggest names in New Orleans music: The Meters, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, the Neville Brothers, Trombone Shorty and others. The most prominent Mardi Gras Indian today is Monk Boudreaux, the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe, and his grandson J\u2019Wan Boudreaux (who holds the position of Spyboy in the tribe) is stepping up with Cha Wa to propel their culture forward.\n\nJ\u2019Wan joined the group when he was still in high school. At the time, Gelini, then a recent Berklee School of Music grad, had been playing drums for Boudreaux\u2019s grandfather, having learned the traditional Mardi Gras Indian beats from original Wild Magnolias bass drummer Norwood \u201cGeechie\u201d Johnson at Sunday night Indian practices in Uptown New Orleans. As the band evolved, J\u2019Wan emerged as the front man. On \u201cSpyboy,\u201d Boudreaux\u2019s vocals (with support from Thaddeus \u201cPeanut\u201d Ramsey\u2019s smooth-voiced Indian style), the booming, funked-up sound of the band\u2019s new four-part horn section, and Gelini\u2019s mix of second line grooves and soulful Indian rhythms have all combined to kindle a new fire in Cha Wa\u2019s ever-developing sound.\n\nAlthough \u201ccha wa\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re comin\u2019 for ya\u201d in Indian vernacular, Boudreaux says the album \u201cSpyboy\u201d is \u201cCha Wa all around\u201d for a different reason. With songwriting contributions to \u201cSpyboy\u201d from band members Joe Maize, Thaddeus \u2018Peanut\u2019 Ramsey, Ari Teitel and Clifton \u2018Spug\u2019 Smith, along with J\u2019Wan and Gelini, Cha Wa ignites an entire new generation with contemporary anthems set ablaze by its high-flying ensemble. Says Boudreaux, \u201cEveryone put their minds together to make this music. Everyone had input on at least one song. And the whole band has a different type of connection these days. Everybody\u2019s bonded now. Everybody\u2019s just having fun\u201d.\n\n\nThe track \u201cGet On Out the Way\u201d -- with its loose, \u201870s funk rhythm, tight horn parts and deep, bouncing sousaphone -- brings that celebratory vibe to life by spiking a traditional Indian phrase with a fast-moving brass band twist.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more serious, social message at work in Cha Wa\u2019s music. Gelini and Monk wrote \u201cVisible Means Of Support\u201d about Monk\u2019s experience with the \u201850s-era Jim Crow vagrancy law used primarily to arrest African-American men. On the J\u2019Wan-penned, big beat-centric \u201cChapters,\u201d the singer tackles more contemporary issues, in this case, the internal struggles he faced while being raised by a single mom.\n\nThe mellow, piano and vocals-only \u201cJ\u2019Wan\u2019s story\u201d sees him taking a different approach to bridging the gap between beauty and harsh reality in New Orleans when he explains, spoken word-style, the basics about how and why Mardi Gras Indian culture developed.\n\n\u201cWe dress up in the Indian suits to pay homage to the Native American Indians, because around the time of slavery, they were the first ones to take us in,\u201d he says, elaborating on the song. \u201cEverything on our suits is handmade -- the beads, the patterns, we sew together pieces of fabric and make the panels, we make the boots -- everything.\u201d\n\nNot that you need a firm understanding of Indian or brass band culture to feel the dance-ready vibrations of Cha Wa\u2019s new music. \u201cIt\u2019s dance music so I think people are attracted to it. Even if people have no idea what the history is, it\u2019s automatically infectious,\u201d Gelini explains. \u201cJ\u2019wan\u2019s the next generation,\u201d the drummer adds. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping this flame lit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "This Will Destroy You", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8809303.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Instrumental, Post-Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "Formed in the early \u201800s, THIS WILL DESTROY YOU has spent the last decade and a half touring the planet relentlessly between recording studio albums and core members Jeremy Galindo and Chris King scoring various films, television, culinary, and other creative entertainment projects in their relative downtime.\n\nThe band initially broke in the United Kingdom in spite of their home base at the time being almost five-thousand miles away. 2006\u2019s debut album Young Mountain was proclaimed \u201cAlbum Of The Year\u201d in Rock Sound by (then) editor Darren Taylor, igniting curiosity, interest, and touring opportunities unimaginable to that point. It was also during this time that the band\u2019s label stateside began lining up synchronization opportunities that sowed the seeds for what was to come.\n\n2008\u2019s self-titled album ushered in an era where the band truly grew a global fanbase, as the record remains their top-grossing title to date and the band was able to graduate to headliner status in large venues everywhere. Toward the end of the album\u2019s initial cycle, Hollywood and the entertainment world at large came calling in a major way, largely sparked by Brad Pitt and director Bennett Miller\u2019s passionate enthusiasm for the band. The duo initially paired THIS WILL DESTROY YOU\u2019s \u201cThe Mighty Rio Grande\u201d to five crucial acts in 2011\u2019s Moneyball, with Villa Del Refugio then going into Pitt\u2019s subsequent World War Z and Miller\u2019s next film Foxcatcher. The licensing landscape exploded from there, as the band and the first two albums were represented across all major sporting events (Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup, Wimbledon, ESPYS, et al), cultural shifts (the UFC\u2019s rollout package for Ronda Rousey), Hollywood\u2019s biggest night (see: Tom Cruise introducing the nominees and awarding \u201cBest Picture\u201d over \u201cThe Mighty Rio Grande\u201d at the 2012 Oscars), and numerous Emmy-award winning dramas on television.\n\n2011 saw a change in rhythm section and an experiment in the darker capacities of the band. Tunnel Blanket features the most raw and visceral material in the band\u2019s catalog. The band stayed on the road (including a meaningful run in direct support of Deftones), issued a triple live album (2013\u2019s Live In Reykjavik, Iceland), and began formulating what would become 2014\u2019s Another Language album, an exemplar of the band and producer John Congleton\u2019s studio prowess.\n\nFrom 2016-2018, the band was able to successfully stage special tenth anniversary shows and tours celebrating Young Mountain and self-titled at high-capacity, sold out gigs around the globe, punctuated by being hand-picked by The Cure to perform in front of tens of thousands at the band\u2019s fortieth anniversary concert in London\u2019s historic Hyde Park. On the front end of that cycle, Galindo and King also managed to successfully pull off writing and recording the ambitious score to the most talked-about new restaurant of 2018, Los Angeles, Calfornia\u2019s Vespertine.\n\nTHIS WILL DESTROY YOU will return to stages this fall on a North American headlining tour. Slated to commence on October 16th in Phoenix, Arizona, the trek will wind its way through over two dozen cities, coming to a close November 17th in San Diego, California. See all confirmed dates below.

She can purr, but she\u2019d rather growl and tell you the truth you\u2019ve always known, but tried to hide from yourself. Masha is a rippling stream, an unexpected riptide, a woman who can go with the flow or create her own tsunami. She can illuminate the stage with the force of her personality, or quietly draw you in to her confidence with a soft confession that will touch your heart and make you misty. Masha is a singer and a songwriter, a woman who was born to perform. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t sing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was little, I sang along with the radio. People like Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston, and Christine Aguilera attracted me, strong women who could really belt it out.\u201d Masha took piano lessons as a child, but by the time she was a teen, she was playing guitar, writing songs and playing open mikes. Masha\u2019s father supported his daughter\u2019s musical ambitions. When the family lived in Latvia, he was lead guitarist in the band of Latvian superstar Laima Vaikule. He helped his daughter put together a demo of cover tunes and she was soon hanging out in recording studios and honing her sound. \"I had a double life that I hid from my friends,\" she says. \"As soon as my classes were over, I\u2019d take the bus into the city and work on my music until late in the morning. They wanted to know why I didn\u2019t want to hang at the football games, but I was driven by the music.\u201d \u201cMy style is hard to pin down,\u201d Masha says. \u201cIt\u2019s dirty and grungy and full of contradictions. I like angry, crazy rockers, happy country songs and folk ballads, anything with real emotion.\" While working on her debut album, slated for release later this year, Masha posted cover videos on YouTube, which generated millions of views and established a genuine fanbase. Those numbers will grow with the release of her first single, \"Mr. Presley,\" an homage to the King of Rock & Roll. \"Sure, at first listen, the song is obviously about Elvis,\" she says. \"But it's also a cry of frustration, trying to find that Prince Charming and wondering if he truly exists. I'm a hopeless romantic who believes in happily ever after, but living in a world where people only care about themselves you start to panic that maybe you'll just die alone, and that perfect man that you envision in your head just doesn't exist. I'm putting Elvis on a pedestal and comparing every man to him. Everything about him, his voice, his looks, he was the King. They just don't make men like that anymore.\" The track, and the rest of Masha's upcoming album was co-penned and produced by Claude Kelly and Chuck Harmony, better known as Louis York. The duo, known for their work with artists such as Bruno Mars, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Mary J. Blige, to name but a few, not only worked on Masha's music, they also signed her to their new label Weirdo Workshop. \u201cI\u2019ve known both Claude and Chuck for years, so being able to finally work with both of them at the same time have literally been the best days of my life,\u201d says Masha. \u201cThey\u2019re so much fun. They bring out the artist I was always meant to be. They both know me so well and are the best friends I could ever have, so it\u2019s perfect. And I\u2019m so excited to be on Weirdo Workshop, a company where dreams really do come true. You have a dozen people there with the intention of making your vision a reality. Everyone has your back and no one fights you for creative control. Artistic integrity is always at the forefront. It really is the perfect scenario for an artist.\u201d As for the future, Masha says, \u201cI can't wait to get out on the road. My goal is to tour forever, to sing in front of people every day and make them happy. Music is about singing live with a real band and showing people your passion. That\u2019s all I ever wanted to do.\u201d Mr. Presley out now! http://smarturl.it/mrpresley", "otherInfo": "A collaboration spanning several timezones between London club The Glove That Fits & Public Works in San Francisco featuring Tornado Wallace"}, {"Address": "148 E.

When people see me play, they just intuitively get it.\u201d\n\nThat 1 Guy will launch his spring concert tour at Seattle\u2019s Crocodile Club, with West Coast dates then moving on to festivals throughout the summer. The shows will coincide with the June 26th release of his second album, The Moon is Disgusting, the follow-up to his critically acclaimed Righteous Babe debut, Songs in the Key of Beotch.\n\nThe album was recorded over the summer of \u201906 with veteran Bay Area engineer Karl Derfler, who has previously worked with such eccentrics as Tom Waits, Roky Erickson and Daniel Johnston. \u201cThe album was originally conceived as the soundtrack to an animated film I wanted to make,\u201d he explains. \u201cI love music that takes you on a trip, a journey.\u201d\n\nSilverman has gone on his own world voyage as That 1 Guy, with performances around the globe, Edinburgh, Scotland\u2019s prestigious Fringe Festival, receiving the Tapwater Award for Best Musical Act, as well as Istanbul and Australia, where he is a revered folk hero, regularly selling out venues. \u201cSo much of my music has an indigenous, tribal rhythm feel to it,\u201d he says, explaining his popularity Down Under, where The Magic Pipe is often compared to the Aussie didgeridoo. \u201cAnd there\u2019s this sort of tubular, pipe-shaped vibe that seems to make perfect sense there.\u201d\n\nHis audiences range from psychedelic warriors to families of all ages. Last year, he embarked on a five-week jaunt with Guns N\u2019 Roses guitarist Buckethead in which the two collaborated nightly. \u201cWe really got out there and had a good time,\u201d says Silverman. \u201cHe brought things out of me musically I don\u2019t bring out of myself.\u201d A That 1 Guy concert is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, like taking a trip around the world without leaving your seat.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Justin", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7092652.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Acoustic, Hip Hop", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "Singer/songwriter from Northwest Georgia.

It's generously warm and inviting, built atop her open, searching voice, but it doesn't shy away from tough emotional truths. Like Lomelda's secular hymns and Hop Along's energetic kiss-offs, Vick's songs survey the damage that can come from loving other people with curiosity and grace. Her new album, Free Company (ANTI-), is her most vital and incisive work yet, a stunningly tuneful rumination on heartbreak and loss that is always galloping toward the horizon.\n\nRaised in California's Central Valley on country music and The Carpenters, Vick picked up her first guitar in fourth grade. She started writing her own songs not long after, inspired by acoustic guitar-wielding radio icons like the Dixie Chicks and Michelle Branch. When her brother got a four-track cassette recorder, Vick started laying her music to tape. She uploaded a few demos to Myspace, back when the early social media platform was a repository for millions of DIY songs. As the internet moved, so did she, migrating to Soundcloud and then to Bandcamp. She learned to play the drums and the bass, rounding out the rhythm of her songs. Once she had put together a sizable number of tracks, she started releasing records on her friends' DIY tape labels.\n\nFor Vick, writing and recording songs is a little like journaling, a way to make sense of the present and shuttle it off into the past. But her intimate compositions soon attracted a strong following of listeners. She may have been writing for herself, but she struck a far-reaching chord. Vick started playing shows around California, opening for bands like Soccer Mommy, Palehound, and Vagabon. In March of 2019, she played her first SXSW.\n\nHer tightest and most cohesive collection of songs, Vick recorded Free Company in a tiny studio her friend Stephen Steinbrink set up inside a rented shipping container--a unique spot that ended up being perfect for her. \"It's a windowless little room, but that made me feel really comfortable,\" she says. \"We did it in the comfort of a weird, atypical recording space.\" Steinbrink plays drums, synth, and bass throughout the record in addition to singing backup. It was the first time Vick had opened up her recording process to someone besides herself, and the inclusion of her friends (Rose Droll, Nikolas Soelter, and Chase Kamp also contributed to the album) helped her polish Boy Scouts' indie pop sound to a sparkle.\n\nWritten in the wake of a breakup, Free Company confronts the pain of loss head-on beneath its weightlessly catchy melodies. It may be an album about \"good old classic heartbreak,\" as Vick puts it, but it relishes the process of healing just as much as it carefully weighs the grief. With sunny vocal harmonies, bright electric guitars, and shuffling up-tempo drums, Free Company doesn't show its hand right away. It asks you to look past its sheen and take in Vick's deeply contemplative lyrics, which add dimension to her sun-soaked arrangements.\n\nOn the album opener \"Get Well Soon,\" Vick reckons with the difficult epiphany that comes when you've worked overtime to help someone you love, only to realize they won't meet you in the middle and help themselves. \"It's a hard thing to say. You're hoping somebody will eventually feel better, but there's also this weird new distance between you. You can't do anything else, but you still really hope that they're OK,\" she says.\n\nOne of the highlights of Free Company with its jangly electric guitar chords and sky-high vocal melodies, \"Expiration Date\" tackles that universal human quandary of impermanence. \"Everything changes all the time. Nothing will last forever,\" says Vick. \"It's such a hard concept to grasp because we just get so attached to things and people and situations. But stuff can't stay how it is forever. That's also to be said about bad stuff that happens. It won't weigh you down forever.\"\n\nWith a keen ear for melody and a palpable sense of empathy, Vick picks apart all the confusing and contradictory ways that people glance off of each other while moving through their lives. Her music is an invitation to shake off the weight that's been dragging you down, to lighten your step and keep moving forward no matter what lies ahead.", "otherInfo": "Chastity Belt"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Ismail Lumanovski", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "KAFANA BALKAN w/ Ismail Lumanovski & Inspector Gadje\nAxon Orchestra\nJill Parker & Little Egypt\n9 pm\n$18 adv / $20 door"}, {"Address": "95 S.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3140 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Maelo Ruiz", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620572.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419282, 37.747238], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Latin, Salsa", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Roccapulco", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Maelo Ruiz & Orquesta Adolocentes"}, {"Address": "99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Rodg", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9005063.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.417316, 37.778083], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Dance -, Trance, Progressive, Trance and more, Progressive Electronic, Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "In a world jam-packed with one-hit wonders, extremely consistent producers of dance music have always been sought-after.

Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren. Seeing his in-studio diligence pay off, Rodg released his debut album in mid-2016 and grabbed early support from Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery and Above & Beyond, all the while riding the US airwaves with title track \u2018High On Life\u2019, which accumulated over two million streams on Spotify to date.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t stop there. After countless collaborations with long-time friend and production partner Ruben de Ronde, on came a collaborative effort that dropped jaws and pushed their sound to an even higher level. With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more.

Creating riffs and tempos that infect the mind, Kinetik creates a sound of unique metal symphony. They have been described as a cross between Meshuggah and Animals as Leaders. Kinetik\u2019s origins can be traced to the late spring of 2007, when drummer Andrew Bailey connected with guitarist Chris Lee. Their early jam sessions began the technical metal sound that is completely Kinetik. Recruiting bassist Eric Tampier, a jazz bassist, further molded and refined the Kinetik sound. Late in the summer of 2007, Robert Anderson added his distinguishing voice to the band, and established Kinetik as an intense force in the San Francisco Bay Area metal scene. Kinetik debuted their first single Approaching Infinity in late 2009, which later was released on their EP, Stoppage Time in 2010. Kinetik went back in the studio in August of 2012 to record their first full-length album at Castle Ultimate Studios with Zack Orhen (All Shall Perish, Warbringer, Decrepit Birth, and Suffocation). The new album was released worldwide, April 16th, 2013, and the band will follow with a strong touring schedule to support the new album, Heavier Elements. Kinetik has just completed the Back from The Dead Tour with Casket of Cassandra and Betrayed by Weakness in August 2013, after the Spring Meltdown Festival. Kinetik is planning a tour that will include South By Southwest shows in March 2014, as well as a full US Tour in Summer 2014 ----------------------------------------------------------- Online/Mobile Press Kit: https://presskit.to/kinetik ----------------------------------------------------------- PRESS: \"Man was I caught by surprise on this one; not only is the playing terrific (as you might expect from a tech-metal band), but there is also a whole groove-infused, percussive thing going on, (think Meshuggah), that really sucks you in. \"Closer Than Contact\" absolutely stands on its own though and is a great metal offering.\" - PureGrainAudio.com \u201cFuckin Oath it\u2019s Badass!\u201d- Dave \u201cHiggo\u201d Higgins | Triple M Distortion \u201cHaving listened to Kinetik a few times now, I am still stunned by the sheer amount of power they\u2019ve managed to contain on their album, but equally am blown away by the sheer level of ability on display from start to finish. All too often bands seem to go through the motions of making an album without putting the effort into turning it into a masterpiece, yet Kinetik seem to have done the opposite, stepping up with an album that\u2019s intricate, powerful, raw, emotional, and quite simple masterful from start to finish.\u201d \u2013 Dave, Loud-Stuff.com ----------------------------------------------------------- Links: http://www.facebook.com/kinetikmetal http://www.twitter.com/kinetikmetal http://www.instagram.com/kinetikmetal http://www.youtube.com/user/kinetikmusic http://www.reverbnation.com/kinetik http://www.soundcloud.com/kinetikmetal Join Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/ws8P9 Get music: http://www.kinetikmetal.bandcamp.com https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/heavier-elements/id635961534 http://amzn.com/B00CDX1O4S Kinetik", "otherInfo": "PLUR Alliance & Shelter SF present\nFALLOUT: EVOL INTENT\nAbove DNA:\nEvol Intent\nCorrine\nKinetik\nDuchess\nShadow Spirit\nDazzle Room:\nSoulr\nGrumpylilshit\nLunar\nTechnopagan -vs- LD-50\nCold Turkey\nShelter.

In one sense they\u2019re a band from another, sturdier era: a band that releases consistently quality material on a consistent basis, a band that doesn\u2019t sacrifice creative drive for commercial interest, a band that grows and evolves with each successive release. From the beautiful madcap mess of debut LP Piecechow to the more refined yet still quite surrealistic jams on Hot Lungs to a cool, polished psych-rock sheen on 2014\u2019s Wink EP, Battlehooch has proven itself as a band built to last. They may possess an old-school mindset, but their music is diverse and daring enough to fit perfectly into this wild new century.\n\n\nFormed in San Francisco \u2013 the birthplace of psychedelia \u2013 it\u2019s fitting that the six-piece collective echoes the city\u2019s tie-dyed past in its own compositions. However, the group isn\u2019t content with becoming a mere tribute to a time period they never lived through. Instead, Battlehooch updates the sound of psychedelia for a new generation, one that can now access dozens of genres and millions of songs with a few clicks of an iPhone. Battlehooch reflects this modern trend of manic music consumption: on any of their many releases, the listener will be treated to a sonic smorgasbord, bouncing from hard rock to dance-pop to mind-warping head trips to flirtations with electronica and jazz and Afrobeat and everything in between within the span of a few minutes, sometimes even seconds.", "otherInfo": "Battlehooch w/ Van Goat, Locus Pocus"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Lloyd Cole", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8119323.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: Singer/songwriter, Folk", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "Posted by LC.

Formed by lead guitarist Aquiles \u201cLito\u201d Maga\u00f1a along with his brother Gus Maga\u00f1a on drums. These two would come to share their passion and love for this era of music and become the driving core for the group. Influenced by the greats such as James Brown, Fred Wesley and the J.B.\u2019s, Parliament Funkadelic, the Meters, and WAR.\n\nThe word Mestizo means the mix and blend of cultural heritage; you cannot find a better word to describe the blending of music, environment, and roots that takes place in Los Angeles, which is one of the most diverse regions in the world. The band members come from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds that enrich the music created and performed.\n\nWhat is one to expect from a live performance of Mestizo Beat?

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 9 PM SHOW: 9:30 PM\nNO meet and greet available"}, {"Address": "3248 22nd St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Brazil Vox", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419552, 37.755527], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Revolution Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "BrazilVox at Revolution Cafe: The walls of this breezy Mission District cafe display a continuously changing exhibition of local visual art, and Papa Toby's diverse music calendar follows suit.

He has been described as \u2018a man who lives, breathes and emanates everything that is beautiful about deep house music and classic garage.\u2019 David is considered a \u2018rising star\u2019 within the dance community.\u2019 With influences varying from Barry White and the Love Unlimited Orchestra, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, Quincy Jones, the Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder, Parliament Funkadelic, the Isley Brothers and First Choice, among others it's easy to see why funk and soul have always been strong elements in his sound. In 1990, David began DJ\u2019ing at the After Dark in his hometown of Monterey, California. As his popularity grew past the boundaries of Monterey, he was invited to establish a residency at Tilt and the Sound Factory in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\n1994, David opened and DJ\u2019ed at the popular club Lift at Club Dv8 (today known as Temple) in San Francisco. His success as a club DJ led to a DJ spot on commercial radio. David joined the popular radio show Your Mama\u2019s House on the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s number one radio station 106KMEL FM. Your Mama\u2019s House was the only \u2018true\u2019 house mix show on any major radio station in Northern California. As part of the Your Mama\u2019s House crew, David played a key role in exposing the masses to House Music in the San Francisco Bay Area till 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n1995 David kicked off a seven year residency at San Francisco \u2018s legendary Club Universe \u2014 San Francisco\u2019s hottest Saturday night party.

This innovative CD, recorded live from Club Universe, reflects San Francisco\u2019s unique \u2018sound\u2019 and introduced the world to David Harness. Recognizing his talent, Twisted America quickly signed him to produce his first single, \u2018Get It Together\u2019, for a Twisted America compilation entitled \u2018A Little Bit of the Old, A Lot of the New\u2019. In 1999, David started Taboo in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District.

Under these aliases you\u2019ll find sweeping emotive cuts, verdant dancefloor workouts and discerning dips into jungle and breaks. Releases have come on respected labels including Meda Fury, Ectotherm, UN.T.O and Lobster Fury: the collaborative label from Lobster Theremin and Meda Fury begun for the explicit purpose of releasing his tracks.\n\nDJ Seinfeld\u2019s beats are ultimately guided by an idea of authenticity, true to the spirit of the early house pioneers and the unabashed rawness the confines of their equipment demanded. A lot\u2019s been made of this lo-fi fuzz, with many clamoring to declare it a scene, but he won\u2019t be put into a box. His path is his own. A microphone picks up the tension and release of a singer: charged with emotion, the machine can\u2019t handle it. The rough edges of his productions emit the same sensibility.\nFootage of his gigs or their post-show reaction exemplifies the reception he gets as a DJ. Biographies often claim a DJ regularly \u2018sends crowds into rapture\u2019 or \u2018lays waste to the floor,\u2019 but in DJ Seinfeld\u2019s case pandemonium is the default. Mixes show his deft control of build-up and feel in the booth, while his mini series for legendary London station Rinse FM in May \u2018DJ Seinfeld presents...\u2019, was a master class in the kind of wonky left-field house he peppers his sets with.\n\nArmand began making music in Edinburgh at the suggestion of a respected friend. Time spent experimenting with music and exploring the possibilities contained within his laptop was cathartic relief from the grind of finishing his studies. Later returning to his hometown of Malmo, his interest in making music would intensify thanks to encouragement from his old school friends and a the looming spectre of a 9-5 lifestyle. A move to Barcelona and the end of a relationship resulted in extended sessions watching the classic American sitcom and the music made to reflect that appeared under the name DJ Seinfeld.\n\nRimbaudian already had traction and DJ Seinfeld was really intended as a side-project to exorcise emotions felt at that time. At first, tracks appeared on music-sharing groups online but he didn\u2019t claim ownership, despite the growing buzz. When his friend Courtesy\u2019s label Ectotherm began asking who the mysterious producer was, he began to take note. Then before long, Lobster Theremin and Meda Fury followed suit.\n\nThe point of no return though came one evening spent with Ableton and a few beers. The track \u2018U\u2019 was uploaded to Soundcloud, and the internet went into overdrive. Sampling Bob Geldoff\u2019s account of his split with his wife, amid soaring chants and keys wrought in heartache, \u2018U\u2019 is almost voyeuristic in its honesty.

From here on, the Perfect Stranger sound had it\u2019s distinctive soundscape and a genre within it\u2019s own. Now that Yuli had everyone\u2019s attention, he took another big step forward with the album \u201cLeap of Faith\u201d in 2012, and marked yet another huge milestone in the Perfect Stranger story, unleashing a long list of epic tunes with timeless soundscapes and perfect groove.https://www.facebook.com/perfectlystrange/https://soundcloud.com/perfect-stranger---------------------------------------------"}, {"Address": "316 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Darnel Christoph", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9967743.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413792, 37.771362], "Date": "Sat Feb 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-08", "Genre": "Genres: House, Tech House, Deep House, Techno, Minimal Techno", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Audio Nightclub", "moreBioInfo": "Darnel Chrsitoph has plans to taking his music to another level of inspiration.

Although their backgrounds and professional training differs, their common desire to release new productions and contribute to the international club scene is equivalent. Together, they combine their previous experiences and endeavors to launch a fresh and innovative musical journey!\n\nRoberto Intrallazzi began his musical career in the latter part of the 80\u2019s and beginning of the 90\u2019s as part of one of the most successful projects of the \u2018made in Italy\u2019 dance era, F.P.I. Project. Their track \u2018Rich in Paradise\u2019 received worldwide acclaim and was one of the first house music releases to come out of Italy. Over the 90\u2019s decade, his sound evolved into more like \u2018house\u2019 of today with influences from electro of the 80\u2019s. The combination of the strong energy and search for new rhythms typical of the 80\u2019s along with the contemporary minimal-electronic sound further assisted with the development of Roberto\u2019s style.\n\nIn 2000, Roberto Intrallazzi met the DJ and producer, Luca Provera who matched Roberto\u2019s knowledge of music and technology. Luca got involved with music at a very young age by building his own recording studio and becoming familiar with the technicalities of making music. Luca utilized computers, mixers, samplers, and keyboards to launch his career as a producer and sound designer; employing both digital and analog equipment.\n\nLuca later went on to produce a private Italian radio show and together with the artist Intrallazzi produced the album \u2018The Pleasure is All Mine\u2019 by Kym Mazelle. His radio and recording studio know-how led him to quickly gain familiarity with both the software and hardware necessary to produce quality house music. He isn\u2019t just a quality producer however he is also a well-known DJ who plays frequently in alternative venues in Italy and all over the world.\n\n\nDJING:\n\n1 mixer... and 4 hands... playing Back 2 Back!\n\nThe Cube Guys know how to make the dancefloor go wild spawning miraculous moments.

Taking part in some of the most eminent and influential parties and clubs globally, The Cube Guys have managed to disassociate themselves from the masses.\n\n\nPRODUCTIONS AND REMIXES:\n\n\nThe Cube Guys sound has traveled all around the globe with recognition from Mark Knight, Pete Tong, Bob Sinclar, Roger Sanchez, Chus & Ceballos, Prok & Fitch, Mike Vale, David Penn, Atfc, Ralph Falcon, Oscar G, Erick Morillo, Dj Boris, David Morales, Hector Romero, and many other big names.\n\nThe Cube Guys' have managed to chart every single on of their releases and have been selected and licensed by the most important international record companies.

Their introduction to folk music came later, when a close friend--who died young due to a tragic misdiagnosis--entrusted to them her collection of 1960s folk albums and her guitar (which has since been featured on all of their albums). Inspired by the grit and true-to-life experiences she heard in these traditional ballads, Hall was inspired to write the lyrics that later became her first songs, aided by Anderson\u2019s flair for musical arrangement. Soon afterwards, Hall released two solo albums, Sings! (1999) and Sunday Afternoon (2002), both produced by Anderson. In the winter of 2003, the duo quit their boring desk jobs, moved to the green hills of Vermont, and decided to pursue a full-time career as touring musicians.\n\n\n\nThey released their first CD, Hungrytown, in 2008; Any Forgotten Thing in 2011; and Further West in 2015.

No Depression christened her \u201cEqual parts June Carter Cash, Nick Cave and Murder By Death.\u201d From Under the Basement magazine summed her up by saying, \u201cImagine Bill Monroe and Sid Vicious having kids together.\u201d Common Folk Music went a step further, suggesting a sound equivalent to \u201cthe glint of a switchblade held to your throat.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while Emch chose to dub her latest project the Secret Emchy Society, the truth is she\u2019s always remained clear and concise when it comes to her convictions. A singer, songwriter, author, poet, radio host and outspoken advocate for causes affecting the LGBTQ community, she\u2019s pursued both cause and craft since first opting to become a performer from the time she was a child, while singing classic cabaret songs with her mother. At age 14, she picked up her first guitar and learned to play via the Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen songbooks. Since then, her career has blossomed, thanks to time with her bands Vagabondage, Feral, Sinners Tonic, and her bluegrass band, convincingly titled Rhubarb Whiskey, whose offshoot Oakland Wine Drinkers Union, Local 88 helped broaden her musical palette. At the same time, she found herself sharing stages with other Bay Area favorites, including T Sisters, 5 Cent Coffee, Mark Growden, Pony Hunt, Foxtail Brigade, and more.\n\nAfter a succession of albums, EPs and guest appearances with such standout artists as Juno-nominated singer Carolyn Mark, the band Unwoman, and longtime collaborator Sean Malroy, Emch expanded her ambitions and founded the aforementioned Secret Emchy Society, a loose collective that features a revolving group of like-minded musicians who hop on her bandwagon during various stops along the tour. The cast currently includes Emch on vocals, guitar and accordion, Hans Winold on bass, Dillie Dauley on viola, and Eric \u201cScratch\u201d Ingerson on drums.\n\nDespite the contributions of her talented co-conspirators, the band\u2019s first offering, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville qualifies as Emch\u2019s official solo debut after years of playing and songwriting with others. She describes it as \u201can album of hard earned heartbreakers and foot stompers about good friends and hard times.\" Emch wrote all the material either in whole or with occasional input from her collaborators, making for a series of songs that rejoice and reflect, ruminate and reminisce about times both good and bad, and especially the importance of being true to one\u2019s own ideas and identity. The music celebrates a variety of vintage styles, from rowdy barn-burners and old time honky tonk, to tears-in- your beer ballads, zydeco rave-ups, and brassy collusions of country and cabaret, aiming to strike its appeal with both the mainstream and the marginalized.\n\nAs her collaborator Carolyn Mark said of Emch\u2019s music \u201cIt pairs well with whisky and hitting the streets.\u201d\n\nBased on initial impressions, the critics seem to agree. \u201cFrom the very first listen I loved this album, after which I loved it more and more with every listen...\" said Mike Morrison of AmericanRootsUK.com. \"The songs on The Stars Fall Shooting are pretty and gritty, sexy and sad,\u201d writes Jessie Lynn McMains aka Rust Belt Jessie, Racine, Wisconsin\u2019s Poet Laureate. \u201cThe music is a mix of everything from honky tonk to alt-country, to jazz and zydeco and punk, and it slides into your ears like a good blend of rye whiskies sliding down your throat. Sweet and warm, with just enough of a burn.\"\n\nNone of this ought to come as any surprise considering that Emch\u2019s literary endeavors have closely paralleled her musical output. A well recognized writer and poet, she has published five chapbooks, founded / hosted / curated the Queer Open Mic for five years, and featured at dozens of spoken word showcases including Sister Spit, the Radar Reading series, K'vetch, Writers With Drinks, as well as co-hosted a queer radio show with Lynn Breedlove. She has been interviewed on PirateCat Radio, FCC Free Radio, Revelator Radio, OutsiderWriters.com, ReadThisMagazine.co.uk, Drinks with Tony (Radio Valencia) and on NPR for her writing, her music, and, she claims, \u201cher propensity for being in car accidents that are not her fault.\u201d Notably too, she has also been featured in the Accordion Babes Calendar and was notoriously Francis Bean Cobain\u2019s favorite \u2018babe\u2019 of that year.\n\nNevertheless, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was borne from less than assuring circumstances. After burning out from years of day-job overtime, the loss of friends and family members and watching her own health decline due to the stress, Emch found herself sitting in a haunted bar in New Orleans, her spiritual second home. There she met a \u201cgrizzled and gorgeous\u201d old woman who told her, \u201cCome on honey, this is New Orleans. You gotta shake your ass!\u201d The musician took the women\u2019s admonition as a sign \u2013 it was time to get down to her real work as a musical artist.\n\nThe Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was recorded at Lucky Mouse Studios in Victoria, British Columbia, with the help of vocalist/guitarist/producer Tolan McNeil and singer/pianist Carolyn Mark who trades vocals with Emch on \u201cHad Enough.\u201d \u201cShe was the first person to put me solo on a stage with a guitar in my hands,\u201d Emch recalls. In fact, it was Mark\u2019s decision to enlist Emch as her opening act for a show at the Epicurean Connection in Sonoma, California that launched the Secret Emchy Society\u2019s first official performance. Mark also recruited members of her own band, bassist Dennis Siemens and drummer/guitarist Joel Fernandes, to assist on Secret Emchy Society\u2019s debut. Other contributors include Grayson Walker on piano and accordion, back-up vocalist J. McLaughlan and Olivier Clements on brass.\n\n\u201cI flew from Oakland to Victoria and spent four days teaching the band the songs, laying down the core tracks, and making sure we were all on the same page,\u201d Emch recalls. \u201cWhat we came up with was an impressive array of harmonies, accordion, piano, upright bass, horns, drums, a whole passel of guitars, and a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEmch, who cites Hank Williams, Hazel Dickens, Shovels & Rope, Johnny Paycheck, Charles Mingus, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Bob Wills, and the Corn Sisters as key influences, went all out when it came to gathering material for the album. \u201cThere are scraps and orphans of songs that made it onto this record that were years and years old,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are songs on this record that were less than two weeks old when they were recorded. All I know is that I threw every bit of myself into it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder then that the results are both highly personal and wholly contagious.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to offer the world is music, stories, and finding ways that I can throw the most powerful parts of myself into a few muddled chords and some danger,\u201d Emch insists.\n\nGiven those efforts, it\u2019s also clear that she\u2019s succeeded.\n\nFor more information and track by track descriptions, go to http://www.emchy.com", "otherInfo": "Dot's Sunday Hoedown Featuring Thee Old Country, Secret Emchy Society, Beckylin & Her Druthers and a special SECRET GUEST who happens to be one of the founding members of The Corn Sisters!\n\nMonthly Sunday Hoedown with the best country, americana, rockabilly, alt-rock bands in the bay.

Her experience growing up far left-of-center in the conservative wilds of fly-over America keeps her rooted in tradition while her stints in New Orleans, San Francisco & Oakland have imbued her material with a sense of adventure & a sympathetic view of the sinners, the gamblers, the rogues, the good-time girls & the losers that populate her songs.\n\nHer songs pour forth in a voice that is 49% heartbreak and 51% fury yet is never devoid of humor & self-awareness.\n\nBeckylin & Her Druthers\nhttps://www.facebook.com/beckylin.country\nBeckylin & Her Druthers are based out of the Bay Area, California, and play classic Wig Country with a catalog spanning the late 1940s through the early 1980s with a few originals thrown in for good measure.

Now \u201cSpyboy\u201d ups the ante by digging deeper into the sound of New Orleans culture and giving it a modern twist. The disc\u2019s largely original material takes advantage of the band\u2019s new horn section to highlight the musicians\u2019 personal ties to the street music of their hometown. \u201cWe wanted to take the roots of what we love about New Orleans brass band music and Mardi Gras Indian music and then voice it in our own way,\u201d says the group\u2019s drummer and founder, Joe Gelini.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition began when African-American men first marched in Native American dress through the streets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras day. The tradition, which includes a host of songs shared among the various tribes, has been kept alive for over a century and today is as vital as ever. Mardi Gras Indians have influenced the biggest names in New Orleans music: The Meters, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, the Neville Brothers, Trombone Shorty and others. The most prominent Mardi Gras Indian today is Monk Boudreaux, the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe, and his grandson J\u2019Wan Boudreaux (who holds the position of Spyboy in the tribe) is stepping up with Cha Wa to propel their culture forward.\n\nJ\u2019Wan joined the group when he was still in high school. At the time, Gelini, then a recent Berklee School of Music grad, had been playing drums for Boudreaux\u2019s grandfather, having learned the traditional Mardi Gras Indian beats from original Wild Magnolias bass drummer Norwood \u201cGeechie\u201d Johnson at Sunday night Indian practices in Uptown New Orleans. As the band evolved, J\u2019Wan emerged as the front man. On \u201cSpyboy,\u201d Boudreaux\u2019s vocals (with support from Thaddeus \u201cPeanut\u201d Ramsey\u2019s smooth-voiced Indian style), the booming, funked-up sound of the band\u2019s new four-part horn section, and Gelini\u2019s mix of second line grooves and soulful Indian rhythms have all combined to kindle a new fire in Cha Wa\u2019s ever-developing sound.\n\nAlthough \u201ccha wa\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re comin\u2019 for ya\u201d in Indian vernacular, Boudreaux says the album \u201cSpyboy\u201d is \u201cCha Wa all around\u201d for a different reason. With songwriting contributions to \u201cSpyboy\u201d from band members Joe Maize, Thaddeus \u2018Peanut\u2019 Ramsey, Ari Teitel and Clifton \u2018Spug\u2019 Smith, along with J\u2019Wan and Gelini, Cha Wa ignites an entire new generation with contemporary anthems set ablaze by its high-flying ensemble. Says Boudreaux, \u201cEveryone put their minds together to make this music. Everyone had input on at least one song. And the whole band has a different type of connection these days. Everybody\u2019s bonded now. Everybody\u2019s just having fun\u201d.\n\n\nThe track \u201cGet On Out the Way\u201d -- with its loose, \u201870s funk rhythm, tight horn parts and deep, bouncing sousaphone -- brings that celebratory vibe to life by spiking a traditional Indian phrase with a fast-moving brass band twist.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more serious, social message at work in Cha Wa\u2019s music. Gelini and Monk wrote \u201cVisible Means Of Support\u201d about Monk\u2019s experience with the \u201850s-era Jim Crow vagrancy law used primarily to arrest African-American men. On the J\u2019Wan-penned, big beat-centric \u201cChapters,\u201d the singer tackles more contemporary issues, in this case, the internal struggles he faced while being raised by a single mom.\n\nThe mellow, piano and vocals-only \u201cJ\u2019Wan\u2019s story\u201d sees him taking a different approach to bridging the gap between beauty and harsh reality in New Orleans when he explains, spoken word-style, the basics about how and why Mardi Gras Indian culture developed.\n\n\u201cWe dress up in the Indian suits to pay homage to the Native American Indians, because around the time of slavery, they were the first ones to take us in,\u201d he says, elaborating on the song. \u201cEverything on our suits is handmade -- the beads, the patterns, we sew together pieces of fabric and make the panels, we make the boots -- everything.\u201d\n\nNot that you need a firm understanding of Indian or brass band culture to feel the dance-ready vibrations of Cha Wa\u2019s new music. \u201cIt\u2019s dance music so I think people are attracted to it. Even if people have no idea what the history is, it\u2019s automatically infectious,\u201d Gelini explains. \u201cJ\u2019wan\u2019s the next generation,\u201d the drummer adds. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping this flame lit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "iLL B", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Afton presents\nLOCAL SHOWCASE\nAbove DNA:\nVal J San Francisco\nDoll Parts\nShae-Nitty\nLewnatic\nWolfman Von\nAfmblo\nChanell J.

They have each worked for many years in the jam band/Americana scene, sharing the stage with prominent artists including Bob Weir (Grateful Dead), Phil Lesh (Grateful Dead), and Warren Haynes (Allman Brothers Band). Now they have joined forces to create original music that they have dubbed \"Acid Americana.\u201d Their music melds vintage rock, blues, country, folk, and California psychedelia into a melodic dreamscape of sound that is sparking a buzz in the jam band community.\nAfter spending the summer as the official entertainment for the Dead & Company Pre-show VIP Lounge, Katie & Andrea have put together a rapidly growing catalogue of original music with influences including Southern rock & soul, 60\u2019s psychedelia, Delta blues, outlaw country, and 70\u2019s California folk. Their arrangements feature various combinations of instrumentation, including electric, acoustic and resonator guitars, pedal steel, fiddle, viola, and mandolin, all composed, arranged, and performed by Katie & Andrea.\nKatie & Andrea is just the latest collaboration for the two musicians. Katie has spent years as a bandleader and songwriter for various groups, from jam-band supergroup California Kind to southern rock and blues groups that draw heavily on her roots from the Southeast. Andrea tours extensively internationally with Zucchero and was a member of Shania Twain\u2019s band for her Las Vegas residency. She has recorded and performed with Kamasi Washington and performed on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s albums \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d and \u201cDamn.\u201d\nThe duo is in the midst of recording their debut EP, Adventures in Acid Americana, and are spending the fall playing shows in support of their upcoming releases.

While she\u2019s covered a lot of musical and literal ground since her formative performative days with that fearless Mid-Atlantic theater troupe, the Baltimore native\u2019s latest venture, Yours Truly, Michele, may best capture the heady mix of influences and experiences she can bring to any party simply by showing up. With a sound infused with 60s pop, shadowy torch songs, and touched by Americana Roots-Rock, it is truly Michele Kappel\u2019s own brand of music.\n\nAfter her time with Impossible Industrial Action, Kappel followed her muse across the United States to California, co-founding the Garage-Pop Alt Rock band The Kirby Grips (Sympathy For The Record Industry), performing behind the drum kit on national stages including at Noise Pop and CMJ. When The Kirby Grips paused for an indefinite amount of time, Kappel picked up the ukulele and guitar, and started writing her own melody-rich songs, inspired by influences as diverse as Squeeze, Ray Price, and the Spector Wall of Sound. Soon, she was performing as the ukulele-toting folk pop artist Tippy Canoe, who channeled not a little of Patsy Cline and Billie Holiday. More recently, Kappel incarnated as one-half of the close-harmony, country-tinged, impeccably decked out duo, Heartache Sisters and was behind the drum kit with classic country band Laura Benitez & the Heartache.\n\nYTM, however, puts Kappel\u2019s style, substance and well-honed musical sensibilities front and center. \u201cNo matter your mood, you\u2019ll walk away with a smile. It\u2019s cheaper than therapy.\" Tony DuShane at The San Francisco Chronicle wrote of a Kappel-Stone performance, which by turns can evoke Debbie Harry, Erin McKeown, and the aforementioned Cline.\n\nNow based in Oakland, readying her first YTM recording project while organizing shows for The California Roots Union and booking one of San Francisco\u2019s best listening rooms, The Lost Church, her finger isn\u2019t just on the musical pulse, it\u2019s an integral part of the heart that keeps the pulse beating.\n\nIf her career thus far has prepared her for anything, it\u2019s fun and adventure.

During his years as lead singer of Toad the Wet Sprocket, the band\u2019s elegant folk/pop sound and his honest, introspective lyrics helped them forge a close bond with their fans. Since starting his solo career, Phillips has pared his music down to its emotional core, concentrating on the simple truths of love and relationships, with a profound spiritual understanding.\nSwallowed by the New takes on life\u2019s difficult transitions and delivers some of the Phillips' most vulnerable songs. \u201cI made this album during the dissolution of a 23 year marriage, Phillips says. \u201cA major chapter of my life was coming to a close, and I discovered early on that I had to work hard to get through the transition with compassion and clarity. These songs were a big part of that process.\u201d\n\nThe album was recorded in May of 2015 with producer/bass player Paul Bryan (Aimee Mann, Lucinda Williams), Jay Bellerose (drums), Chris Bruce (guitar), Jebin Bruni (keys) and Ruby Amanfu (vocals). The sparse arrangements are centered on Phillips\u2019 vocals and acoustic guitar.\n\nShimmering electric guitar accents drift through a curtain of sighing strings on Go, a ballad that bids a poignant farewell to a lover at the end of a relationship.\n\n\u201cAnd though I want you close / This light can only glow / To\nwarn you far away from shore / Saying I love you, now go,\u201d\nLeaving Oldtown has the feel of a classic pop ballad, with a string section and piano supporting a poignant vocal, as Phillips describes a man, \u201chollow as a sparrow bone,\u201d packing up his belongings as winter approaches.\n\nThe Easy Ones focuses on the importance of staying present when it\u2019s not easy or simple, but necessary. Joined in harmony with his 13-year daughter, Phillips says: \u201cYou can\u2019t just love the easy ones / You\u2019ve got to let them in / When you\u2019d rather just run.\u201d\n\nAmnesty is a gentle rocker, with twang-heavy guitars, a funky back beat and elegant string accents, it chronicles a\nlong journey of searching for understanding and safe harbor.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to catch some kind of spark / In every face I see / And offer amnesty.\u201d\n\nHeld Up suggests a gospel tune being chanted by a chain gang. The stomping drumbeat and jubilant handclaps support a vocal that faces the scales of judgment; in balance between self-recrimination and salvation. \u201cBrother you ain\u2019t so broken / Sister you ain\u2019t so small / Everybody goes together / Or nobody goes at all.\u201d\n\nThe folk hymn Grief and Praise was inspired by writer Martin Prechtel who maintains that \u201cgrief is praising those things we love and have lost, and praise is grieving those things we love and will lose\u201d. It sums up the philosophy of the record in no uncertain terms: \u201cFor all that you love will be taken some day / By the angel of death or the servants of change / In a floodwater tide without rancor or rage / So sing loud while you're able / In grief and in praise\u201d\n\nSwallowed by the New is full of the inviting melodies that\nhave always marked Phillips\u2019 work, while his singing reaches a new degree of intimacy and immediacy. The arrangements hint at country, soul, folk, rock and classic pop, without ever sounding derivative. The emotions may be raw, but they are guided by Phillips\u2019 steady vocals towards healing and renewal.\n\nPhillips started Toad the Wet Sprocket in 1986, when he was still in high school. He was as surprised as anyone when their low-key folk rock landed them on the pop charts. When the band members decided to go their separate ways, Phillips began a solo career with Abulum followed by Winter Pays for Summer, Mr. Lemons and Secrets of the New Explorers. Always open to new projects and unlikely collaborations, he\u2019s toured and recorded with Works Progress Administration, a band that included members of Nickel Creek, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Elvis Costello\u2019s Attractions; Mutual Admiration Society with Nickel Creek; Remote Tree Children, an experimental project with John Askew and Plover, with Neilson Hubbard and Garrison Starr.\n\nHis acoustic duo tour to support Swallowed by the New starts in October and will continue through the spring of 2017. \u201cI enjoy the spontaneity of acoustic performance, where I can take the show wherever it needs to go and follow the lead of an audience instead of following a set list. There\u2019s more talking, more stories, and more of a loose feel. The subject matter is on the serious side, but I feel like the perspective is ultimately positive. Life is about changes, no matter how we may try and pretend otherwise. This album is all about learning how to face change.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Glen Phillips (Toad the Wet Sprocket) + Chris Pureka"}, {"Address": "2174 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "CUP (Feat.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 6:30 PM SHOW: 7 PM\nPremier Seating + Meet and Greet Available"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "THE WLDLFE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9147972.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Indie Pop, Alternative, Pop, Pop Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "THE WLDLFE, from Indianapolis, IN, is an indie-alt outfit for fans of acts such as Maroon 5, Twenty One Pilots, and Jon Bellion.

Now \u201cSpyboy\u201d ups the ante by digging deeper into the sound of New Orleans culture and giving it a modern twist. The disc\u2019s largely original material takes advantage of the band\u2019s new horn section to highlight the musicians\u2019 personal ties to the street music of their hometown. \u201cWe wanted to take the roots of what we love about New Orleans brass band music and Mardi Gras Indian music and then voice it in our own way,\u201d says the group\u2019s drummer and founder, Joe Gelini.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition began when African-American men first marched in Native American dress through the streets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras day. The tradition, which includes a host of songs shared among the various tribes, has been kept alive for over a century and today is as vital as ever. Mardi Gras Indians have influenced the biggest names in New Orleans music: The Meters, Dr. John, the Marsalis family, the Neville Brothers, Trombone Shorty and others. The most prominent Mardi Gras Indian today is Monk Boudreaux, the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe, and his grandson J\u2019Wan Boudreaux (who holds the position of Spyboy in the tribe) is stepping up with Cha Wa to propel their culture forward.\n\nJ\u2019Wan joined the group when he was still in high school. At the time, Gelini, then a recent Berklee School of Music grad, had been playing drums for Boudreaux\u2019s grandfather, having learned the traditional Mardi Gras Indian beats from original Wild Magnolias bass drummer Norwood \u201cGeechie\u201d Johnson at Sunday night Indian practices in Uptown New Orleans. As the band evolved, J\u2019Wan emerged as the front man. On \u201cSpyboy,\u201d Boudreaux\u2019s vocals (with support from Thaddeus \u201cPeanut\u201d Ramsey\u2019s smooth-voiced Indian style), the booming, funked-up sound of the band\u2019s new four-part horn section, and Gelini\u2019s mix of second line grooves and soulful Indian rhythms have all combined to kindle a new fire in Cha Wa\u2019s ever-developing sound.\n\nAlthough \u201ccha wa\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re comin\u2019 for ya\u201d in Indian vernacular, Boudreaux says the album \u201cSpyboy\u201d is \u201cCha Wa all around\u201d for a different reason. With songwriting contributions to \u201cSpyboy\u201d from band members Joe Maize, Thaddeus \u2018Peanut\u2019 Ramsey, Ari Teitel and Clifton \u2018Spug\u2019 Smith, along with J\u2019Wan and Gelini, Cha Wa ignites an entire new generation with contemporary anthems set ablaze by its high-flying ensemble. Says Boudreaux, \u201cEveryone put their minds together to make this music. Everyone had input on at least one song. And the whole band has a different type of connection these days. Everybody\u2019s bonded now. Everybody\u2019s just having fun\u201d.\n\n\nThe track \u201cGet On Out the Way\u201d -- with its loose, \u201870s funk rhythm, tight horn parts and deep, bouncing sousaphone -- brings that celebratory vibe to life by spiking a traditional Indian phrase with a fast-moving brass band twist.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more serious, social message at work in Cha Wa\u2019s music. Gelini and Monk wrote \u201cVisible Means Of Support\u201d about Monk\u2019s experience with the \u201850s-era Jim Crow vagrancy law used primarily to arrest African-American men. On the J\u2019Wan-penned, big beat-centric \u201cChapters,\u201d the singer tackles more contemporary issues, in this case, the internal struggles he faced while being raised by a single mom.\n\nThe mellow, piano and vocals-only \u201cJ\u2019Wan\u2019s story\u201d sees him taking a different approach to bridging the gap between beauty and harsh reality in New Orleans when he explains, spoken word-style, the basics about how and why Mardi Gras Indian culture developed.\n\n\u201cWe dress up in the Indian suits to pay homage to the Native American Indians, because around the time of slavery, they were the first ones to take us in,\u201d he says, elaborating on the song. \u201cEverything on our suits is handmade -- the beads, the patterns, we sew together pieces of fabric and make the panels, we make the boots -- everything.\u201d\n\nNot that you need a firm understanding of Indian or brass band culture to feel the dance-ready vibrations of Cha Wa\u2019s new music. \u201cIt\u2019s dance music so I think people are attracted to it. Even if people have no idea what the history is, it\u2019s automatically infectious,\u201d Gelini explains. \u201cJ\u2019wan\u2019s the next generation,\u201d the drummer adds. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping this flame lit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1638 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94703", "Artist": "Bob Hillman", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9742359.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.278843, 37.870516], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Americana, Folk Rock, Acoustic", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Monkey House", "moreBioInfo": "Bob Hillman, a San Francisco singer/songwriter, is well into the second act of a career that began in the late 1990s, flourished in the early 00s, survived ten years of \u201creal jobs,\u201d and resumed in 2016 with the Peter Case- produced Lost Soul.

In between is Marigold, an urgent, multivalent meditation\u2014and an expanded take on the blend of alt-country, indie rock and cerebral humanism that\u2019s inspired the band\u2019s ardent fan community. This marks their Rough Trade Records debut, offering what songwriter Evan Stephens Hall calls a \u201cheart-first\u201d perspective.\nThose familiar with Pinegrove will recognize signature elements of the band\u2019s sound: literary yet conversational lyrics, geometrically interlocking guitars, the dynamic shifting shadows of rhythm and structure. But this effort marks the most spacious, bold, and well defined iteration of the project yet\n\n\nFormed in 2010 by childhood friends Evan and drummer Zack Levine, Pinegrove have released three previous albums \u2014 Everything So Far (2015), Cardinal (2016), and Skylight (2018)\u2014to massive critical acclaim, garnering them a widespread and devoted listenership.

Eric Ben\u00e9t may have changed his look, but one thing has remained consistent: his dedication to crafting authentic music that engages the soul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing any current whatevers,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t, a four-time Grammy Award nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s about music that gives me goose bumps and touches my soul. That\u2019s always been a good barometer for me.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the singer-songwriter\u2019s latest top 5 Urban AC single, \u201cSunshine.\u201d The pure soul/R&B track provides the perfect backdrop for Ben\u00e9t\u2019s heartfelt reflections on a relationship that has lost its spark. The hit has since sparked a remix version featuring Tamia\u2014the singer\u2019s memorable duet partner on his career breakthrough hit, 1999\u2019s \u201cSpend My Life with You.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Spend\u2019 is almost like the national anthem vocally,\u201d notes Ben\u00e9t. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have so much in your arsenal to successfully sing it. Not many singers can do that. But Tamia is all that and more. So it was such a joy to reunite with her on the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 remix.\u201d\n\nBoth tracks are featured on Ben\u00e9t\u2019s eighth studio album. The self-titled, 13-song project, available on Jordan House/Primary Wave Music, once again showcases the depth of the singer-songwriter\u2019s musical scope. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s almost like artists pick a color and stay with that for most of an album,\u201d says Ben\u00e9t. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do one-note albums.\u201d\n\nThus, fans are in store for another aural treat from Ben\u00e9t and his longtime collaborator Demonte Posey. There\u2019s the unadulterated, unfiltered sex appeal of the \u201880s-vibed \u201cInsane,\u201d which is already being ramped up as the follow-up to first single \u201cSunshine.\u201d From there the album veers into a combination of Cameo and Minneapolis funk on \u201cCold Trigger\u201d before rap icon and longtime friend MC Lyte joins in on the fun \u201cHolding On.\u201d Famed jazz musician Arturo Sandoval lends his talents to the Afro Cuban-spiced \u201cRun to Me,\u201d a sonorous ride that Ben\u00e9t describes as \u201cLatin meets soul.\u201d\n\nAdds the singer, whose smooth tenor-to-falsetto range still rings crystal clear, \u201cWhen you listen to my songs, they start off with nice intros and builds. Then they slowly bring you back down to earth. I wanted to do that with this album too: take people on a journey, get their hearts jumping and feet moving before getting down to the intimate and lovely side of things.\u201d\n\nThat musical M.O. dates back to the Milwaukee native\u2019s early days, first as the singer for a pop group called Gerard in the late \u201880s. Later, as a founding member of the band Ben\u00e9t with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash in the early \u201890s, Ben\u00e9t began experimenting with all the voices he was hearing in his head.\n\n\u201cBack then I was discovering who I was artistically,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was so influenced by Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Chaka Khan, the Beatles, Queen. It was just this hodgepodge of where do I go with all of this?\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t ultimately went straight to Warner Bros., who signed him as a solo artist in 1994. His 1996 solo debut True to Myself put both music fans and the industry on notice. But it was the 1999 sophomore set A Day in the Life, featuring \u201cGeorgy Porgy\u201d as well as his first No. 1 R&B single, \u201cSpend My Life with You\u201d featuring Tamia, that hit home. What doubled as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s career breakthrough became a gold record that later notched his first Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Since then the singer has released five more studio albums, scored more hits including \u201cYou\u2019re the Only One\u201d and \u201cSometimes I Cry\u201d and added three more Grammy nods\u2014the most recent in 2012 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \u201cSometimes I Cry.\u201d\n\nBeyond music, Ben\u00e9t is heavily involved in two charitable organizations. Mission Save Her (http://missionsaveher.org), co-founded by him and actor/singer Reggie Benjamin, fights against the human trafficking, slavery and sexual abuse of women and girls around the world. In a Perfect World (www.iapw.org.), established by Ben\u00e9t\u2019s wife Manuela Testolini, pushes to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy in economically poor countries like Haiti, Nicaragua and Senegal. Now in its 10th year, the organization has just built its 30th school and, in the process, benefited more than 30,000 children and teens around the world.\n\nCurrently celebrating the 20th anniversary of his solo debut, Ben\u00e9t believes one thing accounts for his ongoing success.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister and I recorded our first album as Ben\u00e9t,\u201d recalls the singer, \u201cwe had some control creatively but not all. The label put out a single and then dropped us right away. I told myself then that if I ever got the chance to do another record, I was going to have complete autonomy. That I was just going to do music that made me fall in love with music.\u201d\n\nIn Spring 2016, Eric joined fellow contemporary R&B standard-bearers Anthony Hamilton and Lalah Hathaway for a 16-date tour. Ben\u00e9t relished the opportunity to keep paying it forward. \u201cThe conversation that happens between me and the audience while I\u2019m performing compares to almost nothing. At the end of the day, my heart lives in R&B/soul. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d", "otherInfo": "DOORS: 845 PM SHOW: 9:00 PM\nNO meet and greet available"}, {"Address": "101 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "WERD", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8520003.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "Born in OC, raised into LA\u2019s DnB community.

His upbringing at the Maxfield Home orphanage in Kingston and being albino in Jamaica were two obstacles the he overcame and went on to be (at one time) the biggest reggae artist since Bob Marley.\n\nAfter winning a talent contest at Tastee Patties in Kingston, Yellow went on to excite reggae crowds all over Jamaica and the rest of the world with his boastful and sometimes bodacious lyrics. His ability to ride rhythm and excite a crowd made Yellow an instant hit in Jamaica. He also began to work with the Ace Sound System in St. Thomas and drew big crowds at his dancehall performances. Later in his career, Yellow began to spread out and work for a number of different producers, sometimes releasing as many as five albums per year. This led to a recording contract with CBS Records. Yellowman recorded one album with them before he was diagnosed with jaw cancer and was given six months to live. This was in 1986. After surgery an extended leave of absence from the record industry, Yellowman began his comeback with the song \"Blueberry Hill\", and his career was re-launched. His first album for RAS came from producer Phillip 'Fatis' Burrell and was called \"Yellow Like Cheese\". Coincidentally this was the start of a long and fruitful relationship with RAS and Yellowman and also RAS and 'Fatis' and his exterminator production. Yellowman has always been very professional to work with and always a respectful and reliable human being.

No Depression christened her \u201cEqual parts June Carter Cash, Nick Cave and Murder By Death.\u201d From Under the Basement magazine summed her up by saying, \u201cImagine Bill Monroe and Sid Vicious having kids together.\u201d Common Folk Music went a step further, suggesting a sound equivalent to \u201cthe glint of a switchblade held to your throat.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while Emch chose to dub her latest project the Secret Emchy Society, the truth is she\u2019s always remained clear and concise when it comes to her convictions. A singer, songwriter, author, poet, radio host and outspoken advocate for causes affecting the LGBTQ community, she\u2019s pursued both cause and craft since first opting to become a performer from the time she was a child, while singing classic cabaret songs with her mother. At age 14, she picked up her first guitar and learned to play via the Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen songbooks. Since then, her career has blossomed, thanks to time with her bands Vagabondage, Feral, Sinners Tonic, and her bluegrass band, convincingly titled Rhubarb Whiskey, whose offshoot Oakland Wine Drinkers Union, Local 88 helped broaden her musical palette. At the same time, she found herself sharing stages with other Bay Area favorites, including T Sisters, 5 Cent Coffee, Mark Growden, Pony Hunt, Foxtail Brigade, and more.\n\nAfter a succession of albums, EPs and guest appearances with such standout artists as Juno-nominated singer Carolyn Mark, the band Unwoman, and longtime collaborator Sean Malroy, Emch expanded her ambitions and founded the aforementioned Secret Emchy Society, a loose collective that features a revolving group of like-minded musicians who hop on her bandwagon during various stops along the tour. The cast currently includes Emch on vocals, guitar and accordion, Hans Winold on bass, Dillie Dauley on viola, and Eric \u201cScratch\u201d Ingerson on drums.\n\nDespite the contributions of her talented co-conspirators, the band\u2019s first offering, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville qualifies as Emch\u2019s official solo debut after years of playing and songwriting with others. She describes it as \u201can album of hard earned heartbreakers and foot stompers about good friends and hard times.\" Emch wrote all the material either in whole or with occasional input from her collaborators, making for a series of songs that rejoice and reflect, ruminate and reminisce about times both good and bad, and especially the importance of being true to one\u2019s own ideas and identity. The music celebrates a variety of vintage styles, from rowdy barn-burners and old time honky tonk, to tears-in- your beer ballads, zydeco rave-ups, and brassy collusions of country and cabaret, aiming to strike its appeal with both the mainstream and the marginalized.\n\nAs her collaborator Carolyn Mark said of Emch\u2019s music \u201cIt pairs well with whisky and hitting the streets.\u201d\n\nBased on initial impressions, the critics seem to agree. \u201cFrom the very first listen I loved this album, after which I loved it more and more with every listen...\" said Mike Morrison of AmericanRootsUK.com. \"The songs on The Stars Fall Shooting are pretty and gritty, sexy and sad,\u201d writes Jessie Lynn McMains aka Rust Belt Jessie, Racine, Wisconsin\u2019s Poet Laureate. \u201cThe music is a mix of everything from honky tonk to alt-country, to jazz and zydeco and punk, and it slides into your ears like a good blend of rye whiskies sliding down your throat. Sweet and warm, with just enough of a burn.\"\n\nNone of this ought to come as any surprise considering that Emch\u2019s literary endeavors have closely paralleled her musical output. A well recognized writer and poet, she has published five chapbooks, founded / hosted / curated the Queer Open Mic for five years, and featured at dozens of spoken word showcases including Sister Spit, the Radar Reading series, K'vetch, Writers With Drinks, as well as co-hosted a queer radio show with Lynn Breedlove. She has been interviewed on PirateCat Radio, FCC Free Radio, Revelator Radio, OutsiderWriters.com, ReadThisMagazine.co.uk, Drinks with Tony (Radio Valencia) and on NPR for her writing, her music, and, she claims, \u201cher propensity for being in car accidents that are not her fault.\u201d Notably too, she has also been featured in the Accordion Babes Calendar and was notoriously Francis Bean Cobain\u2019s favorite \u2018babe\u2019 of that year.\n\nNevertheless, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was borne from less than assuring circumstances. After burning out from years of day-job overtime, the loss of friends and family members and watching her own health decline due to the stress, Emch found herself sitting in a haunted bar in New Orleans, her spiritual second home. There she met a \u201cgrizzled and gorgeous\u201d old woman who told her, \u201cCome on honey, this is New Orleans. You gotta shake your ass!\u201d The musician took the women\u2019s admonition as a sign \u2013 it was time to get down to her real work as a musical artist.\n\nThe Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was recorded at Lucky Mouse Studios in Victoria, British Columbia, with the help of vocalist/guitarist/producer Tolan McNeil and singer/pianist Carolyn Mark who trades vocals with Emch on \u201cHad Enough.\u201d \u201cShe was the first person to put me solo on a stage with a guitar in my hands,\u201d Emch recalls. In fact, it was Mark\u2019s decision to enlist Emch as her opening act for a show at the Epicurean Connection in Sonoma, California that launched the Secret Emchy Society\u2019s first official performance. Mark also recruited members of her own band, bassist Dennis Siemens and drummer/guitarist Joel Fernandes, to assist on Secret Emchy Society\u2019s debut. Other contributors include Grayson Walker on piano and accordion, back-up vocalist J. McLaughlan and Olivier Clements on brass.\n\n\u201cI flew from Oakland to Victoria and spent four days teaching the band the songs, laying down the core tracks, and making sure we were all on the same page,\u201d Emch recalls. \u201cWhat we came up with was an impressive array of harmonies, accordion, piano, upright bass, horns, drums, a whole passel of guitars, and a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEmch, who cites Hank Williams, Hazel Dickens, Shovels & Rope, Johnny Paycheck, Charles Mingus, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Bob Wills, and the Corn Sisters as key influences, went all out when it came to gathering material for the album. \u201cThere are scraps and orphans of songs that made it onto this record that were years and years old,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are songs on this record that were less than two weeks old when they were recorded. All I know is that I threw every bit of myself into it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder then that the results are both highly personal and wholly contagious.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to offer the world is music, stories, and finding ways that I can throw the most powerful parts of myself into a few muddled chords and some danger,\u201d Emch insists.\n\nGiven those efforts, it\u2019s also clear that she\u2019s succeeded.\n\nFor more information and track by track descriptions, go to http://www.emchy.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "500 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Brendan Getzell", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.398131, 37.779293], "Date": "Mon Feb 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hotel Utah Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Open Mic with Brendan Getzell at Hotel Utah: The Old West and indie music come together at the Hotel Utah Saloon, where a small stage, an antique bar, and a diversely stocked jukebox set the scene.

It\u2019s a record about isolation that fosters connection, a narrative of anxiety that offers reassurance, a chronicle of despair that promises hope. Inspired by the moments that come just before sleep, when silence descends and doubt and fear and desire take over, the album is an unflinchingly honest self-examination, a courageous reckoning with darkness and depression. Along with his musical partner Dan Cobb, Cullen captures the full range of those nightly emotional rollercoasters on the album\u2014the consuming guilt, the crippling loneliness, the directionless drifting\u2014bringing them to life in a seductive blend of electronic grooves, dreamy synths, and washed out guitars.\n\nWhile the record finds the British duo pushing their songwriting to bold new heights, it also manages to preserve their unassumingly homespun roots. Teaming with producer Gianluca Buccellati (Tei Shei, Colouring), Cullen and Cobb recorded most of the collection in their respective bedrooms before adding finishing touches at London\u2019s Hackney Road Studios. The album opens with the ominous \u201cHandmade Ego,\u201d a menacing, mesmerizing track that walks a tightrope between sexual desire and self-loathing as Cullen\u2019s breathy, layered vocals build from a whisper to a snarl. On the hypnotic \u201cBottled Up,\u201d Cullen explores the emotional toll of self-isolation, while the swirling \u201cNo Devotion\u201d weighs the costs of a loveless relationship, and the epic title track channels the whirlwind of a racing mind as it spirals deeper and deeper into the reverberating darkness. As heavy as the subject matter can be, the songs often strike a tone of defiant optimism, transforming regret and pain into growth and strength, secure in the knowledge that, no matter how it may feel some nights, none of us are truly alone in this world.\n\nSince its inception, Tender has specialized in walking that artful line between the personal and the universal. The British duo\u2019s acclaimed debut, \u2018Modern Addiction,\u2019 charted the aftermath of a tumultuous breakup, earning rave reviews on both sides of the pond for its stark beauty and soul-baring candor.

But their connection was magnetic. From the corner of the room, Yael watched as Gil picked up a stray guitar and began playing. She joined him, nervously layered her softly spoken vocals over Gil\u2019s plucked melodies of \u201cJolene,\u201d and like that, Lola Marsh began.\n\nAt the start of 2016, the young duo self-released \u201cYou're Mine,\u201d an impressive debut EP that cemented Lola Marsh as collaborators of magnetic, thoughtful indie-pop. Their distinctive sound resulted in a quick rise, first online and then in person, with performances bringing the band to Europe and North America.\n\n\nThey followed with their debut record, \u201cRemember Roses,\u201d in the summer of 2017 - an effervescent collection of songs that boast a stunning juxtaposition of wistfulness and melancholy, set against an eccentrically offbeat pop backdrop. The record conjures up imagery of pastel skies and carefree summer days; and seeks to find beauty in even the most softly spoken and mundane moments of everyday life.\n\n\nThe lead single from the record, \u201cWishing Girl\u201d is a perfect example of their seamless collaborative nature; with playful whistles and an upbeat melody, set against a narrative of a failed relationship. As NPR described it; when together, Yael and Gil \u201cmount a charm offensive powerful enough to knock down some pretty sturdy defenses.\u201d\n\n\nThe record was received with critical acclaim, drawing attention from NPR, Paste Magazine, NYLON, Observer, Interview Magazine and more. Once again their music brought them Stateside, seeing the duo tour across the country, playing festivals throughout the summer of 2017.\n\n\nFrom the slower and almost Lana Del Rey-esque moments of \u201cShe\u2019s A Rainbow\u201d, to the gleeful \u201cStranger\u201d, \u201cRemember Roses\u201d is an expansive record from the duo who admit, they aren\u2019t always looking forward.\n\n\n\u201cThe song, \u2018Morning Bells' is about the beginning of Lola Marsh,\" explains Cohen, \"the way both of us struggled to fulfill our dream together while trying to survive the challenging life of being musicians.\" It's fitting, then, that the track did not emerge in one fell swoop. It began with a beat, and after some time melody and lyrics followed, but Landau and Cohen had difficulties arriving at the right chorus. \"We wanted something uplifting and strong, and tried all kinds of different parts before we found the right one,\" says Cohen.\n\n\nThe song, and the overall sound of the record, expresses the trust, nervousness, and excitement that's tied up in being creatively open without reserve - much like that first fateful rendition of \u201cJolene\u201d that brought the duo together at a house party in Tel Aviv.\n\n\nLola Marsh\u2019s debut record, \u201cRemember Roses\u201d is available now via Verve (Universal) / Barclay.", "otherInfo": "LOLA MARSH\nsupport tba\n8 pm\n$12 adv / $15 doors\nAll Ages"}, {"Address": "155 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Gaucho", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7519822.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.405592, 37.796778], "Date": "Mon Feb 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-10", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Acoustic, Swing", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Comstock Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "Gaucho is a masterful Bay Area band that combines the influence of gypsy jazz of 1930\u2019s Europe with the rhythmic drive and collective improvisation of New Orleans swing music, gutbucket blues and elements of ragtime.

Affectionately known as the \u201cIron Man of the Mask,\u201d Franc held the title of \u201cThe World\u2019s Longest-Running Phantom\u201d for more than a decade after bringing over five million theatre-goers to their feet in a 6-1/2-year run.\n\nBut that distinction only scratches the surface of an illustrious career spanning decades, including his portrayal of the opera-singing Anthony Corleone, son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton\u2019s characters in the seven-time Academy Award-nominated film Godfather III. Franc also sang the Academy Award-winning theme song \"Speak Softly Love\" for both the film and Original Motion Picture soundtrack, garnering over one million hits on YouTube. Paramount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search for the young Corleone, auditioning more than 2,000 artists over a one-year period before casting Franc in the role. He is the first and only person ever to sing Carmine Coppola\u2019s haunting Godfather theme in the film trilogy.\n\nFranc\u2019s performance of the song so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to study at Pavarotti\u2019s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously studied at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of \u201cTony\u201d in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow\u2019s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical.\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s BROADWAY: Songs from the Great White Way, and Franc D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, along with tributes to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, including NBC\u2019s \u201cBrian Boitano\u2019s Skating Spectacular\u201d and \u201cThe 2005 Tribute to Music on Ice\u201d with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc\u2019s performance of \u201cMusic of the Night,\u201d as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening\u2019s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nIn May 2018, Franc was honored to receive a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival.

A prolific composer and prodigious six-string talent, Di Meola has amassed over 20 albums as a leader while collaborating on a dozen or so others with the likes of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia, Jean-Luc Ponty and more. And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal status among hordes of frettboard aficionados who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di Meola's writing and compositions along with the soulfulness of his guitar expressions, have won him legions of fans worldwide.\n\nA pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy and 1978's Casino, the guitar great has continued to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African music throughout his long career.\n\nDi Meola\u2019s most recent release, 2013\u2019s \"All Your Life\", was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music. So their impact was pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14 familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar. All the tracks are imbued with the guitarist\u2019s signature flamenco flourishes, intricate arpeggiating and dazzling cross-picking. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the Beatles created most of their records during their heyday, \"All Your Life\" stands as a triumph in the long and illustrious career of a bona fide guitar hero. \u201cI\u2019ve come full circle with this,\u201d says Di Meola. \u201cI started out my life loving the Beatles, and I never stopped, just like a lot of so many other guitarists from my generation. In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d\n\nDi Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar.\n\"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d\n\nA native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d\n\nFollowing a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al. After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.\n\n1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause.\n\nNow in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.\n\nVisit: http://www.aldimeola.com/#!tour/c9a0\n\nAlbum recordings can be found at:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/al-di-meola/id814570\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-di-meola-mn0000600228/discography\n\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Al+Di+Meola/+albums", "otherInfo": "This is an all ages show.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1120 Merrill St, Menlo Park, CA 94025", "Artist": "The Complements", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8140915.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.182453, 37.45455], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Positive Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Off the Grid: Menlo Park", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-songwriter acoustic duo from California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "999 California St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Ricardo Scales", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.410248, 37.791405], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Top of the Mark", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ricardo Scales at Top of the Mark: This famed martini bar offers high-class wallpaper music on the weekends, including lounge piano, easy listening, classical, and some jazz combos.

The only way to survive was to try to transcend myself, to find some kind of deeper, spiritual relationship with life. Once I committed to that, all these little miracles started happening.\u201d\n\n\u2018Forever Just Beyond,\u2019 Barzelay\u2019s stunning new album under the Clem Snide moniker, may just be the most miraculous of them all. Produced by Scott Avett, the record is a work of exquisite beauty and profound questioning, a reckoning with faith and reality that rushes headlong into the unknown and the unknowable. The songs here grapple with hope and depression, identity and perception, God and the afterlife, humanizing thorny existential issues and delivering them with the intimate, understated air of a late-night conversation between old friends. Avett\u2019s production is similarly warm and inviting, and the careful, spacious arrangement of gentle guitars and spare percussion carves a wide path for Barzelay\u2019s insightful lyrics and idiosyncratic delivery.\n\n\u201cI look up to Eef with total respect and admiration,\u201d says Avett, \u201cand I hope to survive like he survives: with total love for the new and the unknown.

His upbringing at the Maxfield Home orphanage in Kingston and being albino in Jamaica were two obstacles the he overcame and went on to be (at one time) the biggest reggae artist since Bob Marley.\n\nAfter winning a talent contest at Tastee Patties in Kingston, Yellow went on to excite reggae crowds all over Jamaica and the rest of the world with his boastful and sometimes bodacious lyrics. His ability to ride rhythm and excite a crowd made Yellow an instant hit in Jamaica. He also began to work with the Ace Sound System in St. Thomas and drew big crowds at his dancehall performances. Later in his career, Yellow began to spread out and work for a number of different producers, sometimes releasing as many as five albums per year. This led to a recording contract with CBS Records. Yellowman recorded one album with them before he was diagnosed with jaw cancer and was given six months to live. This was in 1986. After surgery an extended leave of absence from the record industry, Yellowman began his comeback with the song \"Blueberry Hill\", and his career was re-launched. His first album for RAS came from producer Phillip 'Fatis' Burrell and was called \"Yellow Like Cheese\". Coincidentally this was the start of a long and fruitful relationship with RAS and Yellowman and also RAS and 'Fatis' and his exterminator production. Yellowman has always been very professional to work with and always a respectful and reliable human being. He has managed to outlive his predicted fate of death and his performances are incredibly lively as he seems to have an unlimited amount of stage energy. We can only hope for the best for Yellowman. He has continued his hard work and his devotion to his family is to be complimented.\n\nThe rudest Dancehall toaster of the 1980s, Jamaica's albino son Yellowman made as many enemies as fans with his controversial, often overtly sexist (if tongue in cheek) lyrics.

Since then, at age thirteen he moved on to become the youngest ever to be endorsed by Gibson, earning his name for his stylings on a vintage '56 Stratocaster. Lunche's newest singles are a testament to his knack for crafting rich arrangements that are not afraid to indulge in soul leanings.\n\nSimon Lunche has packed a near lifetime of musical experience into just 21 years. As the creative force behind Bay Area based indie act, The Blondies, he's written and produced the band's entire catalog and made his name as a captivating live performer. Having spent the last decade as a frontman, Lunche now delivers a solo debut that brings a powerful new depth and even more dynamic vision to his artistry.\n\nFormed when Lunche was 9 years old, The Blondies released their acclaimed album Just Another Evening in June 2016 and toured the Western US, right around the time of his high school graduation. While several of the older band members decided to focus on finishing college, Lunche opted to forego school and pursue music full time. Despite having written The Blondies four LPs on his own, Lunche quickly found that working as a solo artist added a greater degree of creative freedom and sparked an unexpected evolution in his sound.\n\nAs he settled into finding his voice as a lead guitarist, Lunche conjured up a guitar lick and composition that would make its way to multi Grammy Award winning engineer Dave Reitzas (who's previously worked with artists ranging from Barbra Streisand to The Weeknd). While working with Dave on his mixing, he met Sean Hurley (John Mayer bassist) who is currently in production with Simon on his upcoming album. At its center is Lunche's own luscious vocals, producing lustrous guitar licks along the way that help carry the tunes forward. Rounding it up is bass from Sean Hurley, drums from Aaron Sterling, and backing vocals from Tiffany Palmer (John Mayer) and Brandon Winbush (Tori Kelly), sealing the deal on a brand of music that Lunche acknowledges as \"soul pop\".\n\nSimon is known for his dynamic live performances. Audiences claim that his guitar and voice take them to another place. He has been compared to John Mayer, Jeff Buckley, James Bay, and Ed Sheeran.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Lows", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "JAMES TAUGHER & THE WHO CARES (album release show)\nSweet Lew & the Sweet and Lows\nBasi Vibe\n8 pm\n$14 adv / $17 doors"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Helen", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8378510.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Electronic, Alternative, Pop, Electro", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "Unique vocals, one of a kind melodies and ability to blend brave new age electro synths with powerful lyrics that can\u2019t be overlooked. #helen #bebrave", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Marinero", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Sessa at The Chapel"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "James Taugher & The Who Cares", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "JAMES TAUGHER & THE WHO CARES (album release show)\nSweet Lew & the Sweet and Lows\nBasi Vibe\n8 pm\n$14 adv / $17 doors"}, {"Address": "453 Cortland ave, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Rock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6643774.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.416775, 37.739269], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Rap, Hip Hop, Hip-hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lucky Horseshoe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rock and Blues Jam with Ed Ivey This classic blues & funk jam session is a popular mid-week event featuring great local blues players.

Thanks to the forward thinking programming of Laurent\u2019s local radio station and a DJ with his finger on the pulse of a golden age in the making in New York \u2013 Laurent\u2019s musical education in all things hip hop was of the highest order. An old Mac and a stack of old LPs were mere catalysts for Laurent to try and emulate the sounds from across the pond.\n\nA subsequent move to the UK introduced electronica to his broadening taste and influenced his own sound. Then followed work soundtracking short films and theater productions which added a cinematic element to his repertoire. Following a disheartening stint doing some production work for a Paris based hip hop label convinced Laurent that he should be doing things on his own terms. A self released EP led to being picked up by Illicit Recordings in London \u2013 through which \u201cMickey Mouse Operation\u201d was eventually released. This was 2006 and his debut album only made a very modest splash. Over the past 4 years it has however turned into something of a sleeper \u2018hit\u2019 \u2013 gathering fervent support in the US and slowly climbing the US iTunes electronic chart in the process.

Even fewer can create a unique style which continues to set them apart from all others by being the very first in a genre they laid the foundation for. Possessed are by definition, the creators of Death Metal.\n\nPossessed took San Francisco\u2019s metal scene by storm, playing with fellow Bay Area thrashers and friends Exodus, and other bands- many now long gone. In 1982-1983, they recorded a four song demo. One of the demo tracks, \u201cSwing of the Axe\u201d ended up on the Metal Massacre 6 compilation and later on \u201cThe Best of Metal Massacre.\u201d Released in October 1985 on Combat Records, Seven Churches set a new standard for extreme music. Combining lighting fast riffs, Becerra\u2019s raspy trademark growl and speedy bass playing, Pummeling drums and Randy Burns\u2019 production, Seven Churches created a whole new genre of music- death metal. Seven Churches went on to be one of Combat Records\u2019 best-selling albums. Not bad for a quartet of high school kids!\n\nBeyond the Gates. Released on Halloween in 1986, this album was especially well-received in Europe where they toured at the end of the year. The album that changed the landscape of heavy metal, Beyond The Gates was the highest selling Combat album that year.\n\nAfter that tour, Possessed recorded and released Eyes of Horror, a five song EP produced by Joe Satriani. Musically and lyrically advanced, the album touched on dark themes such as sin, drugs and violence and, of course, the devil. Not long after the release of the EP, LaLonde (early guitars) joined up with Les Claypool and Primus. Soon after, Mike Sus (early drums) left to continue his studies at SFSU and Torrao (early guitars) decided he no longer wanted to play in a band. Becerra continued to play and joined some side projects, but mostly took time to pursue his goals in life including his attending SFSU. In 1992, while coming home from work, tragically, Jeff was shot twice by two different gunmen who were attempting to rob him. It would be seventeen-and-a-half years before Jeff was again able to resurrect Possessed after receiving literally thousands of fan letters, emails and fan support.\n\nIn 2006, Becerra joined with Sadistic Intent to record \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d for a Possessed tribute album. Becerra and Sadistic Intent decided to do a few live shows to satisfy fans who had been clamoring for shows for decades. With such a positive response, Becerra and Sadistic Intent continued to play a number of successful shows, including Wacken 2007, Maryland Deathfest 2009, and 2010\u2019s Blackest of the Black Tour. This lineup breathed life into Sadistic Intent and Becerra, and the two parties split amicably to play their own styles of metal, with drummer Emilio Marquez staying with Becerra and Possessed.\n\nAfter making several live appearances, including Graspop 2012 & The Fallen Angel 2012 European Tour, Cursed Over Europe 2014 Tour and the Evil Over Europe Tour\n2016, Possessed is primed and finally ready for a new era. The Possessed legacy has been highly influential in the realm of extreme metal, changing the genre forever. Ready to take it further, Possessed is planning several tour dates and writing new material that will change the face of death metal once more.\n\nIn 2017, Possessed joined the Nuclear Blast family. Fans can expect POSSESSED's first a full-length release in 31 years, sometime in 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "300 College Ave, Los Gatos, CA 95030", "Artist": "Brother Spellbinder", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8749047.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.98408, 37.215301], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Indie, Folk", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Testarossa Winery", "moreBioInfo": "Brother Spellbinder plays well-crafted songs with old world ache and modern angst.

Deftly balancing atmospheric and airy instrumentation, thoughtful emotionality, and just the right amount of hard-hitting hypnosis, the Southern California quintet\u2014James DeBerg [vocals], Devin Chance [guitar], Josh Thomas [guitar], Josh Billimoria [bass], and Garrett Halvax [drums]\u2014descend into the dreamy depths of loss, love, and life reflected in art on their full-length debut, The Love You Let Too Close [Rise Records].\n\n\u201cWe aim to make songs that are heavy and fun, but you can also listen to them on a nighttime drive home through the rain when you\u2019re thinking about life,\u201d exclaims DeBerg. \u201cYou could call it post-hardcore rock, but it\u2019s more than that. We just want people to feel what we\u2019re feeling.\u201d\n\nThey first harnessed that energy in early 2016. After amicably parting ways with Outlands, the frontman quietly kept writing music. One day, Thomas presented him some demos of \u201cthese pretty sad jams,\u201d and they dove headfirst into a collaboration together. Blindwish guitarist Chance joined the fold next followed by Billmoria and Halvax as the boys hit a San Diego studio to record. Rise Records became entranced by the initial output as well as the cinematic, self-funded video for \u201cTradition\u201d and offered the band a deal. Handpicking the collaborative team, they finished recording with producer Sebastian Rizo, enlisting the mixing talents of Andreas Magnusson [Fit For A King] and Kris Crummett [Sleeping With Sirens, Issues] for mastering.\n\nOver this rich sonic backdrop, DeBerg openly explores the suicide of his best friend and its aftermath on The Love You Let Too Close.\n\n\u201cThe theme of my life\u2019s descent is central to the record,\u201d he admits. \u201cLosing my best friend flipped my whole world upside down and changed who I am as a person. I used to be happy-go-lucky. I smiled through everything in life. It wasn\u2019t the same after. The songs go through my healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms as well as the other feelings that came about during this really low and depressed period. I fell in love during a broken time, but I pushed back too. This is a chronicle of everything I noticed about myself.\u201d\n\nOn the first single \u201cNo Place Like You,\u201d solemn piano chords resound over a haze of feedback before guitars swell into a wave of emotion on the captivating chorus chant.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make that one a little bit lighter,\u201d says DeBerg. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly singing. Lyrically, it\u2019s about being so depressed that it screws up a relationship with someone you care for a lot.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the record, the opener \u201cSinking Me\u201d builds from a bombastic beat awash in lush guitar tones before snapping into a searing scream. Meanwhile, the title track encapsulates both extremes, shifting from delicate to deadly.\n\nThe Love You Let Too Close ignites Thousand Below\u2019s journey. As they tour with everyone from The Devil Wears Prada to Veil Of Maya, listeners will undoubtedly fall under their spell, because each lyric and note are unequivocally real.\n\n\u201cI enjoy writing sad music,\u201d DeBerg leaves off. \u201cIt\u2019s a very therapeutic process that helps me. I want people to take a close look at the concepts, listen to them, and read the lyrics. I imagine others have been through losing loved ones to suicide. This is an admission, \u2018It hurts. It feels dark. It\u2019s a rough time, but there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.\u2019 I want to remind everyone they\u2019re not alone, and we do make it through.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "480 Hartz Ave, Danville, CA 94526", "Artist": "The Fourth Son", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8918148.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.99835, 37.820879], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "The Vine and Spirits", "moreBioInfo": "The Fourth Son is a San Francisco based solo project created by Tim Connor.

From The Wreckage glowed with a rootsy golden tone that encompassed everything from indie-folk, to alt-country to blues-rock to Southern psychedelia. Its creators, touring musician turned songwriter and producer Dwight Baker and singer-songwriter Patty Lynn, began making music together on a lark, never dreaming anything would come of it. Baker describes it as \u201ckind of like what happens when two friends hold hands and jump in a freezing lake just to see what it feels like.\u201d Thanks to the undeniable chemistry between the pair, the music took on a life of its own and The Wind and The Wave soon found themselves with a major-label record deal, embarking on U.S. headlining tours, having their songs appear in such TV shows as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and racking up millions of plays on Spotify and Apple Music. The band also earned itself a rabid following, with fans especially enamored of Lynn\u2019s feisty vocals and brutally personal lyrics about challenging relationships with lovers and family members as well as her relationship with herself. \u201cPeople really treasure that album,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe got tons of letters from people saying it saved their life. They\u2019re people who are conflicted and searching and they connect with Patty\u2019s lyrics more than anything.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for The Wind and The Wave to make their second album, Baker says he and Lynn felt \u201csome bit of an obligation to deliver that again.\u201d The band definitely delivered on their sophomore album, Happiness Is Not A Place, and the result is the sound of a band that has stretched itself and grown. Lynn managed to dig a little deeper with her lyrics, exploring her difficult feelings on commitment, and family, while acknowledging her own frantic mind. And the band\u2019s sonic palette is nervier, thanks to the album being recorded live by producer Butch Walker. \u201cTo me, it sounds reckless with a rock and roll spirit and attitude, an \u2018I don\u2019t give a fuckedness,\u2019 if you will. I wanted it to make sense to our fans, but to feel like a step forward musically. And I think we accomplished that. It\u2019s really rough around the edges, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency and pent-up stuff that probably came from both Patty and my nervousness about making a record with an outside producer.\u201d\n\nAfter being dropped by two major labels, all expectations and second guesses went flying out the window. The band\u2019s third full length album, Human Beings Let You Down, was a record made in hotels and backstage dressing rooms across the US. \u201cGetting married was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Lynn, \u201cBut it also brought out a lot, good and bad, and therapy helped me work through it. That\u2019s what the song Neon Prayer Flags is all about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta tough to be Patty, or anyone in her life, because if something\u2019s amiss, she\u2019s going to write about it. And you\u2019re going to know it\u2019s about you, and you\u2019re going to feel weird about it,\u201d Baker says with a chuckle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in the line of fire. Patty and I are two people who, while we strive to be joyful and positive, can be very much morose and negative, and that definitely comes out in the songs.\u201d\n\nThe band is currently working on their fourth album, and will embark on a series of acoustic mini tours in 2020, called The Feelings Club.", "otherInfo": "Come be a part of The Feelings Club.

He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata.

His four beautifully crafted solo albums and two co-led releases have garnered widespread critical acclaim.\nFor Turrisi, tradition and improvisation are not different countries but two sides of the same mountain.

His brother, Andrew, is a well known concert pianist living in Boston; his brother, Bobby, lives in Paris and is a leading woodwind player in European jazz and studio scenes. His sister, Paula, is a professional singer living in New Orleans.\nRangell first played flute at the age of 15. Within months he was studying both classical and jazz music at The Interlochen Arts Academy, a national camp for gifted music students. He went on to attend The New England\nConservatory of Music in Boston. As a student he twice won Down Beat Magazine's prestigious National Student Recording Awards competition both as best jazz and best pop/rock instrumental soloist. After college he headed to New York in 1984 to pursue his career.\nThe next four years were spent \"paying dues\", sitting in, playing alongside, and gigging with some of the world's greatest contemporary jazz musicians including Hiram Bullock, Jorge Dalto, Eric Gale, Richard Tee, Jaco Pastorius, David Sanborn, Michael Brecker and many others. He also found occasional employment with the legendary Gil Evans Monday Night Orchestra and worked on many commercial jingle recording sessions. Rangell's debut album was released on Gaia/Gramavision Records, but soon thereafter he was signed by Larry Rosen and Dave Grusin at GRP Records.\nA succession of albums followed at GRP where he recorded eight CDs. His stated ambition throughout these endeavors has been \"to try to consistently grow and evolve as a player and broaden my horizons as an artist while endeavoring to make music that people will feel and relate to.\" With his musical armory encompassing flute, piccolo, alto, tenor and soprano saxophone as well as whistling, he was well equipped to fulfill this desire. He has recorded with The Rippingtons, Chuck Loeb, Patti Austin, Tom Browne, and The GRP All Star Big Band to name a few and is featured on Don Grusin's Grammy nominated CD \"The Hang.\" Though Rangell has recorded mostly in the contemporary/pop and smooth jazz formats garnering top radio play and a large audience, The Times of London also notes that \"heard live a much more robust and idiosyncratic player emerges. With his discography of now 17 CD releases Nelson Rangell continues on his musical path with 2 new and unique albums, \"Red\", a collection of dedicated saxophone recordings in the pop jazz and contemporary jazz idiom and \"Blue\" which features the flute and piccolo throughout it's highly diverse 11 tracks.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Hotplate", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "SFJazz Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Hotplate\" at SFJAZZ Center: Opened in January 2013, the new Hayes Valley home of SFJAZZ is an ambitious building that houses an auditorium, rehearsal spaces, a learning lab, cafe, and more."}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "PLS PLS ME", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9120048.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Indie Pop, Indie Folk, Indie Electronic, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "Pls Pls Me is a queer indie electro duo born in Austin, TX and coming of age in Brooklyn, NY.

It was inevitable that from the moment of his birth his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as \u201cmusician\u201d on Dweezil\u2019s birth certificate). Dweezil\u2019s early years were spent largely away from the spotlight\u2014something of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family. Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad.It wasn't until he was 12 that he began to show a serious interest in manipulating the instrument to make music. Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father's music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil \u2018s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. To gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father's band at that time, Steve Vai. Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions. Later that year he recorded his first single, \u201cMy Mother Is A Space Cadet\u201d, produced by Edward Van Halen and released on Frank Zappa\u2019s Barking Pumpkin label. In 1984, Dweezil contributed guitar solos to both \u201cStevie\u2019s Spanking\u201d and \u201cSharleena\u201d on Frank\u2019s album Them Or Us. In 1986, Dweezil made his debut in Hollywood as an actor with his role in the classic 80s film \u201cPretty In Pink.\" 1987 saw Dweezil raise his profile further with another film role alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mick Fleetwood in \"The Running Man.\" In television he worked as a guest MTV VJ. During that same period he recorded and released his first full length album, Havin\u2019 A Bad Day. This album contained the single \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d which featured Moon Zappa on vocals and found itself on regular rotation on MTV. The video featured cameo appearances from Frank Zappa, Robert Wagner, Don Johnson and Jane Fonda as well. Around this same time, Dweezil made his own cameo appearances on records for a variety of diverse artists. He played a solo on the Fat Boys \"Baby You're A Rich Man\u201d as well as on the Grammy Nominated cover of \"Wipeout\" with Herbie Hancock and Terry Bozzio from the \"Back To The Beach\" film soundtrack. He was asked to join Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bonnie Raitt in contributing guitar performances to Miami Vice star Don Johnson's solo album. While Dweezil actually played on the song \"The Last Sound Love Makes\" it was his appearance in the video for Don Johnson\u2019s single \u201cHeartbeat\" that would most notably link him to the project. 1988 saw Dweezil sign a deal with Chrysalis Records, releasing his second album My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama. More TV work followed in 1990 Dweezil and Moon Zappa starred with Laverne And Shirley legend Cindy Williams in a sitcom for CBS titled Normal Life. With the release of his third album Confessions in 1991, Dweezil began to branch out musically, blending his heavy rock approach with touches of his father\u2019s distinct compositional insignia. Guest appearances on this album pointed the way toward the future for Dweezil, including contributions from Nuno Bettencourt , Gary Cherone and Pat Badger of Extreme and legendary guitarists Warren DeMartini, Steve Lukather and Zakk Wylde as well as Frank Zappa sidemen Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes. Both Moon and Ahmet Zappa also added vocals to the album. Dweezil conceived and directed 2 videos from the album, 'Gotta Get To You' and 'Vanity' both of which featured Robert Wagner as a guest star. Robert Wagner has appeared in 4 of Dweezil's videos as well as the \"Music For Pets\" infomercial spoof. There were a handful of live shows played to support the Confessions album. That tour saw the band develop a unique set of skills and usher in the birth of a remarkable non stop medley that grew to contain 200 songs performed in 20 minutes. After completing the Confessions tour Dweezil formed a new band and project with Ahmet called Z. Armed with a mountain of material and no permanent drummer the band entered the family owned rehearsal space called Joe's Garage and rehearsed with several different drummers who ended up playing on tracks for the new album. Those drummers included Terry Bozzio, Mark Craney, Toss Panos, and Tal Bergman. Rather than move to a studio they set up for recording rehearsals. The band recorded over 3 dozen tracks at Joe's Garage. The \"Shampoohorn\" album was completed in 1992 but awaited it's release over a year later. It was eventually released with 2 different track listings. The band featured Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes and initiated it's new permanent drummer, Berklee School Of Music-trained drummerpar excellence Joe Travers before departing for a world tour. Thunes departed later in 1994 and was replaced by Bryan Beller who had attended classes at Berklee alongside Joe Travers. The band toured the US and Europe in 1995. They played original material as well as some more oddball medleys including the infamous \"Peavey Medley.\" In 1996 they released a follow-up album, Music For Pets. By the time of the album\u2019s release, both Beller and Keneally had left the band and Z gradually ceased to exist. Dweezil stayed in the public eye however with several projects including composing the theme music for the Emmy Award winning Fox television show \"The Ben Stiller Show\" and on camera TV appearances including taking the role of Ajax in the Klasky Csupo animated series Duckman and a TV series for the USA network called Happy Hour which he starred in alongside Ahmet. 2000 saw Dweezil issue his first solo album since 1991\u2019s Confessions... with the release of Automatic. By this time, Dweezil\u2019s musicianship had come full-circle as he showed off his guitar virtuosity with eclectic all guitar orchestrations of \"You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch\" and \"Hawaii 5-0.\" In 2003 More television work came about as Dweezil formed a band for the WB unconventional improvisational comedy \"On The Spot\" and performed live in each episode. He also composed the theme music for the WB series \"The Jamie Kennedy Experiment\" and composed dozens of tracks for the music library Extreme Music. Many of these track are heard on various television shows around the world. The next several years saw Dweezil preparing to take on an extremely difficult challenge\u2014bringing his father\u2019s legendary music back to the concert stage. In 2006, some indication of what could be expected surfaced with Dweezil\u2019s next solo album Go With What You Know. The Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa band's current 2014 lineup is known as the \"rocking teenage combo.\" Now a 6 piece they are firing on all cylinders propelled by the ryhthm section of Ryan Brown on drums and Kurt Morgan on bass. Boundless energy is contributed by the rest of the line up which includes original core member multi-instrumentalist Sheila Gonzalez, as well as multi-year veterans Chris Norton on keyboards and vocals as well as vocals/brass/miscellaneous from Ben Thomas. Currently Dweezil has developed his online guitar course for students. It's branded as \"DWEEZOLOGY\" and is available here on the DZW site http://www.dweezilzappaworld.com/pages/dweezology as well as on line at truefire.com. He has also participated with the likes of Jazz legends Mike Stern and Lee Ritenour in the top notch Crown Of The Continent guitar festival in Montana. 2014 marked the inaugural Frank Zappa scholarship at the festival. Dweezil plans to return to \"Montana soon...\" to participate and contribute to future COC events. 2015 marked a milestone for Dweezil's Zappa Plays Zappa project. The band has consistently played concerts around the world for the past 10 years. Racking up well over 1,000 shows. In that time Dweezil did not have a time to cultivate his own music. November 27th 2015 marks the release of Dweezil's first new album since \"Go With What You Know\" in 2006. Dweezil Zappa has returned to his musical roots with his new CD release Via Zammata'. Fusing analog tape and tube guitar amps alongside surprising instruments such as fretless guitar and the oud, Zappa draws you into his intimate, and multifarious musical world. Armed with unexpected vocal arrangements that sound like the Beach Boys procreated with the Bulgarian Women's Choir, this collection of 12 uniquely orchestrated songs represents a true metamorphosis for Dweezil Zappa the solo artist. The album was produced and arranged by Dweezil Zappa and features songwriting collaborations with Frank Zappa and venerable actor John Malkovich. Dweezil found himself in the midst of some controversy and family drama after the passing of his Mother. The Zappa Family Trust, now operated by Dweezil's 2 younger siblings, fired off a cease and desist letter to Dweezil. The letter required Dweezil to immediately stop using the name Zappa Plays Zappa. A story about this dispute was printed by the New York Times on April 29, 2016. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/business/media/whats-in-a-name-just-ask-frank-zappas-feuding-heirs.html?_r=0 In response to the letter from the ZFT, Dweezil changed the name of his band to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa and continues to tour playing his father's music for appreciative audiences worldwide. Dweezil\u2019s proudest accomplishments are as father to his two daughters Zola Frank Zappa (born 2006) and Ceylon Indira Zappa (born 2008).

As Stonefield, they\u2019ve got three albums and thousands of miles under their belts, plus plenty of perspective on what it\u2019s like to fight to make a place for themselves, and tell their own story.\n\nWritten largely on the road in America earlier this year, the songs on BENT are filled with reference and reflection--the kind that comes from months spent far from home, living on four wheels. The surreal isolation of trudging through white-out snow and snaking down deserted highways served as the perfect backdrop for the band to look inward, taking stock of the journey they\u2019ve taken thus far as musicians, and as people. \u201cIt\u2019s a culmination of experiences, emotions,and stories collected over time,\u201d explains lead singer and drummer Amy Findlay, \u201cA growth of honest, raw, energy that has been burning within us and waiting for its moment.\n\n\u201dRecorded in just five days with Joe Walker and Stu Mackenzie from King Gizzard at their studio in Melbourne, the album is almost 100% live. Besides being an impressive feat and the flexing of a confident band operating at the height of their powers, that immediacy lends the album a distinct, crackling energy--thunder, lightning, and muscle-bound horsepower. \u201cSleep\u201d opens the album with guitars covered in five inches of sludge and distortion and something that sounds like a far-off siren, or the high-pitched howling of the wind. It serves as a warning, a call to arms,kicking things off with a next-level version of the massive, unholy racket the band has become known for over the course of their last three albums.\n\nThe sonic inspiration taken from listening to Black Sabbath, Beak, Deep Purple, The Alan Parsons Project, and Mike Oldfield inject BENT with its sternum-shaking heaviness and ever-present swagger, but also its exploratory fearlessness--letting the songs loose to twist and turn, sticking to no one\u2019s rules but their own. Take the proggy, keyboard-soaked intro at the top of \u201cPeople,\u201d or the cheeky combination of tinnitus-inducing hard rock and hip-shaking boogie at thecore of \u201cDead Alive.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t make me think I\u2019ve lost control / I know exactly what you said / Don\u2019tmake me think it\u2019s in my head,\u201d Amy sings during the latter, keeping the lyrics as defiant as the music.\n\n\u201cThe album is about our own experiences and stories,\u201d explains Amy, \u201cSongs about the fear of walking home alone at night, stories of what it\u2019s like being an all-female band and the power of supporting one another.\" With that being the lyrical subject, the music that came out is definitely our heaviest.\u201d It\u2019s clear that darker thoughts were on the Findlay sisters\u2019 mind-- \u201cRoute 29,\u201d with its suspenseful synth intro was inspired by the creepy The Route 29 Stalker podcast the band was listening to as they drove the namesake road on their way to a gig with King Tuff, and the cascading synth line and slinky restraint of the hi-hat on \u201cIf I Die\u201d can only distract so much from the song\u2019s terror-stricken lyrics.\n\nIt\u2019s on the album\u2019s last two songs that the band makes their strongest statement, using \u201cShutdown\u201d to explore the doubt and search for validation that comes from moving and working within an industry that often makes the band feel like outsiders, lacing lines like \u201cIs it easy for you living / When you don\u2019t have to prove your meaning\u201d in between a battle-cry chorus and detonations of guitar and keyboard. And \u201cWoman\u201d takes it to the edge with a chorus of \u201cI am enough / I am woman,\u201d spelling it out for anyone that hasn\u2019t been paying attention.\n\nBENT has all the chills and spills you would expect from an album that mines inspiration from some of the darker experiences of being misrepresented, belittled, and underestimated. By taking control of the narrative, and pumping it up with stack-blowing, guitar hero riffs and razor-edged vocals, it becomes an album of power, control, and confidence--projected in the face of a world that too often forces the opposite.\n\nStonefield are:\nAmy Findlay: Drums/Vocals\nHannah Findlay: Guitar\nSarah Findlay: Keys\nHolly Findlay: Bass", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3049 20th St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Jinx Jones", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.411406, 37.758862], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Atlas Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jinx Jones & Jessica Rose at Atlas Cafe: What's not to love about Atlas Cafe?

It was inevitable that from the moment of his birth his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as \u201cmusician\u201d on Dweezil\u2019s birth certificate). Dweezil\u2019s early years were spent largely away from the spotlight\u2014something of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family. Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad.It wasn't until he was 12 that he began to show a serious interest in manipulating the instrument to make music. Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father's music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil \u2018s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. To gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father's band at that time, Steve Vai. Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions. Later that year he recorded his first single, \u201cMy Mother Is A Space Cadet\u201d, produced by Edward Van Halen and released on Frank Zappa\u2019s Barking Pumpkin label. In 1984, Dweezil contributed guitar solos to both \u201cStevie\u2019s Spanking\u201d and \u201cSharleena\u201d on Frank\u2019s album Them Or Us. In 1986, Dweezil made his debut in Hollywood as an actor with his role in the classic 80s film \u201cPretty In Pink.\" 1987 saw Dweezil raise his profile further with another film role alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mick Fleetwood in \"The Running Man.\" In television he worked as a guest MTV VJ. During that same period he recorded and released his first full length album, Havin\u2019 A Bad Day. This album contained the single \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d which featured Moon Zappa on vocals and found itself on regular rotation on MTV. The video featured cameo appearances from Frank Zappa, Robert Wagner, Don Johnson and Jane Fonda as well. Around this same time, Dweezil made his own cameo appearances on records for a variety of diverse artists. He played a solo on the Fat Boys \"Baby You're A Rich Man\u201d as well as on the Grammy Nominated cover of \"Wipeout\" with Herbie Hancock and Terry Bozzio from the \"Back To The Beach\" film soundtrack. He was asked to join Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bonnie Raitt in contributing guitar performances to Miami Vice star Don Johnson's solo album. While Dweezil actually played on the song \"The Last Sound Love Makes\" it was his appearance in the video for Don Johnson\u2019s single \u201cHeartbeat\" that would most notably link him to the project. 1988 saw Dweezil sign a deal with Chrysalis Records, releasing his second album My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama. More TV work followed in 1990 Dweezil and Moon Zappa starred with Laverne And Shirley legend Cindy Williams in a sitcom for CBS titled Normal Life. With the release of his third album Confessions in 1991, Dweezil began to branch out musically, blending his heavy rock approach with touches of his father\u2019s distinct compositional insignia. Guest appearances on this album pointed the way toward the future for Dweezil, including contributions from Nuno Bettencourt , Gary Cherone and Pat Badger of Extreme and legendary guitarists Warren DeMartini, Steve Lukather and Zakk Wylde as well as Frank Zappa sidemen Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes. Both Moon and Ahmet Zappa also added vocals to the album. Dweezil conceived and directed 2 videos from the album, 'Gotta Get To You' and 'Vanity' both of which featured Robert Wagner as a guest star. Robert Wagner has appeared in 4 of Dweezil's videos as well as the \"Music For Pets\" infomercial spoof. There were a handful of live shows played to support the Confessions album. That tour saw the band develop a unique set of skills and usher in the birth of a remarkable non stop medley that grew to contain 200 songs performed in 20 minutes. After completing the Confessions tour Dweezil formed a new band and project with Ahmet called Z. Armed with a mountain of material and no permanent drummer the band entered the family owned rehearsal space called Joe's Garage and rehearsed with several different drummers who ended up playing on tracks for the new album. Those drummers included Terry Bozzio, Mark Craney, Toss Panos, and Tal Bergman. Rather than move to a studio they set up for recording rehearsals. The band recorded over 3 dozen tracks at Joe's Garage. The \"Shampoohorn\" album was completed in 1992 but awaited it's release over a year later. It was eventually released with 2 different track listings. The band featured Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes and initiated it's new permanent drummer, Berklee School Of Music-trained drummerpar excellence Joe Travers before departing for a world tour. Thunes departed later in 1994 and was replaced by Bryan Beller who had attended classes at Berklee alongside Joe Travers. The band toured the US and Europe in 1995. They played original material as well as some more oddball medleys including the infamous \"Peavey Medley.\" In 1996 they released a follow-up album, Music For Pets. By the time of the album\u2019s release, both Beller and Keneally had left the band and Z gradually ceased to exist. Dweezil stayed in the public eye however with several projects including composing the theme music for the Emmy Award winning Fox television show \"The Ben Stiller Show\" and on camera TV appearances including taking the role of Ajax in the Klasky Csupo animated series Duckman and a TV series for the USA network called Happy Hour which he starred in alongside Ahmet. 2000 saw Dweezil issue his first solo album since 1991\u2019s Confessions... with the release of Automatic. By this time, Dweezil\u2019s musicianship had come full-circle as he showed off his guitar virtuosity with eclectic all guitar orchestrations of \"You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch\" and \"Hawaii 5-0.\" In 2003 More television work came about as Dweezil formed a band for the WB unconventional improvisational comedy \"On The Spot\" and performed live in each episode. He also composed the theme music for the WB series \"The Jamie Kennedy Experiment\" and composed dozens of tracks for the music library Extreme Music. Many of these track are heard on various television shows around the world. The next several years saw Dweezil preparing to take on an extremely difficult challenge\u2014bringing his father\u2019s legendary music back to the concert stage. In 2006, some indication of what could be expected surfaced with Dweezil\u2019s next solo album Go With What You Know. The Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa band's current 2014 lineup is known as the \"rocking teenage combo.\" Now a 6 piece they are firing on all cylinders propelled by the ryhthm section of Ryan Brown on drums and Kurt Morgan on bass. Boundless energy is contributed by the rest of the line up which includes original core member multi-instrumentalist Sheila Gonzalez, as well as multi-year veterans Chris Norton on keyboards and vocals as well as vocals/brass/miscellaneous from Ben Thomas. Currently Dweezil has developed his online guitar course for students. It's branded as \"DWEEZOLOGY\" and is available here on the DZW site http://www.dweezilzappaworld.com/pages/dweezology as well as on line at truefire.com. He has also participated with the likes of Jazz legends Mike Stern and Lee Ritenour in the top notch Crown Of The Continent guitar festival in Montana. 2014 marked the inaugural Frank Zappa scholarship at the festival. Dweezil plans to return to \"Montana soon...\" to participate and contribute to future COC events. 2015 marked a milestone for Dweezil's Zappa Plays Zappa project. The band has consistently played concerts around the world for the past 10 years. Racking up well over 1,000 shows. In that time Dweezil did not have a time to cultivate his own music. November 27th 2015 marks the release of Dweezil's first new album since \"Go With What You Know\" in 2006. Dweezil Zappa has returned to his musical roots with his new CD release Via Zammata'. Fusing analog tape and tube guitar amps alongside surprising instruments such as fretless guitar and the oud, Zappa draws you into his intimate, and multifarious musical world. Armed with unexpected vocal arrangements that sound like the Beach Boys procreated with the Bulgarian Women's Choir, this collection of 12 uniquely orchestrated songs represents a true metamorphosis for Dweezil Zappa the solo artist. The album was produced and arranged by Dweezil Zappa and features songwriting collaborations with Frank Zappa and venerable actor John Malkovich. Dweezil found himself in the midst of some controversy and family drama after the passing of his Mother. The Zappa Family Trust, now operated by Dweezil's 2 younger siblings, fired off a cease and desist letter to Dweezil. The letter required Dweezil to immediately stop using the name Zappa Plays Zappa. A story about this dispute was printed by the New York Times on April 29, 2016. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/business/media/whats-in-a-name-just-ask-frank-zappas-feuding-heirs.html?_r=0 In response to the letter from the ZFT, Dweezil changed the name of his band to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa and continues to tour playing his father's music for appreciative audiences worldwide. Dweezil\u2019s proudest accomplishments are as father to his two daughters Zola Frank Zappa (born 2006) and Ceylon Indira Zappa (born 2008).

Eight years later, the trio of Alex Hwang (guitar/vocals), Daniel Chae (guitar/vocals) and Sally Kang (keys/vocals) have returned to the name \u2014 this time as the title of their upcoming EP, \u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One,\u201d out in May 2019.\n\nA celebratory effort ushering in a new era for the band, after having recently evolved from a sextet to a trio, \u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One\u201d is about finding hope in transition, discovering your voice in a sea of doubt, and deciding to dance despite sadness. \u201cIt\u2019s learning to trust your own voice regardless of whatever's happening outside of you,\u201d Chae says.\nSince the departure of three founding band members in 2016, Run River North have fought to reclaim their identity and their sound. With that came a reckoning: The trio were steadfast on returning to their roots and rebranding again as Monsters Calling Home as a way to separate themselves from the personnel changes. Instead, the EP\u2019s title \u2014 and the music within it \u2014 became the vehicle to move past the anger and hurt feelings. \u201cHaving to go through three breakups, it was a shitty time,\u201d Hwang says. \u201cI just stopped wanting to write songs that were angry. It\u2019s a good emotion to go through but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re left with that\u2019s not a healthy place to be. The songs on the EP are more representative of how do you find hope and how do you find joy even if you have a right to feel angry. How can you find a reason to dance even when everyone is telling you it\u2019s not the right time to dance?\u201d\n\nNot just an Asian-American band or a group that relies on a set sonic formula, the EP continues to expand upon the band\u2019s prior folk-leaning backbone. On lead single \u201cHands Up,\u201d the band is at their most bombastic. The result of a co-writing collaboration with Hannah Hooper and Christian Zucconi of Grouplove \u2014 the duo\u2019s first of such sessions \u2014 \u201cHands Up\u201d pairs an earworm-y chorus with a front-and-center guitar melody, a second voice among Hwang\u2019s lead bellow. Overall, the group utilizes more drum programming, dreamy synth, and dynamic production \u2014 a more expansive sonic palette.\n\n\u201cMonsters Calling Home: Part One\u201d is bookended by brother-sister songs \u201cCasina\u201d and \u201cCasino.\u201d A song with roots in the band\u2019s days as a six-piece, \u201cCasino\u201d was written as the group\u2019s former members began to phase out. A wistful and rustic intro builds into a walloping chorus: \u201cI\u2019m stuck in this casino / not much left for me.\u201d It\u2019s a song which serves as catharsis when reckoning with the forces that hold us down, a song inspired by Hwang\u2019s mother\u2019s cancer diagnosis. \u201cAt the time it was this big middle finger to cancer or anything you felt was giving an absolute statement to people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cCasina,\u201d on the other hand, was borne out of a late-night studio session between Chae, Kang and their producer, Miro Markie. Aiming to re-work \u201cCasino,\u201d \u201cthey handed me a microphone and they were like, \u2018Try singing,\u2019\u201d Kang remembers. Her take on the song\u2019s chorus added an air of whimsy balancing Hwang\u2019s belt. The pair ping-pong verses and lines, creating a push-pull of dizzying tension. \u201cI think this may be the first song that we don\u2019t have a lead vocalist in a song,\u201d Chae says. \u201cWhen Sally wrote her part on this song it was the first time we thought this might be something. That\u2019s the moment I can point to that was really exciting for this EP. It\u2019s a linchpin for this EP.\n\nWith the energy of \u201cCasina\u201d \u2014 and Kang finding her voice \u2014 in mind, Run River North move forward as a true collaborative effort unthwarted by ego and pretense. No longer held back by fear or discontent, Run River North persevered through pain and came out on the other side victorious wearing a newfound confidence. \u201cIt became about who is in the band,\u201d Hwang says, \u201cand now it feels like Sally, Daniel, and me being very comfortable in our own skin.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Jason J.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8989381.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Reggae", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Great American Music Hall Presents HIRIE with Special Guests Nattali Rize and Jason J"}, {"Address": "453 Cortland ave, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Blues Jam", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.416775, 37.739269], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lucky Horseshoe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rock and Blues Jam with Ed Ivey This classic blues & funk jam session is a popular mid-week event featuring great local blues players.

Establishing themselves in the contemporary jazz world over the past few years, TIZER has spurred comparisons of a modern twist to the 70s and early 80s heyday of jazz fusion, when trailblazing ensembles like Return To Forever, Mahavishnu Orchestra and Weather Report set the aesthetic standard. Truly embodying the title and spirit of his 2007 solo album Diversify, Lao assembled a group of veteran world-class musicians to create a dynamic rich with new melodic, harmonic and improvisational possibilities. Co-produced by Lao and guitarist Jeff Kollman (GlennHughes, UFO, Chad Smith\u2019s Bombastic Meatbats), the eclectic set includes five original compositions by Lao and numerous collaborations with his cohorts, including the first single \u201cWorld In Rhythm,\u201d co-written with Emmy winner and Grammy nominated guitarist Chieli Minucci, best known as founder and leader of Special EFX. Over the past few years, TIZER\u2014a 2011 nominee for \u201cJazz Group of the Year\u201d--has taken their multi-faceted world fusion vibe around the globe, galvanizing thousands at events including the Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta, the Joy of Jazz Festival in Johannesburg, the Dubai Jazz Festival, Barbados Jazz Festival, the Caribbean Sea Jazz Festival and the Festival International Providencia Jazz in Santiago, Chile. In addition to their usual whirlwind of U.S. dates, their 2012 schedule in support of Downbeat includes the Jarasum International Jazz Festival in South Korea and four shows in Russia. While Lao was a \u201cBest New Jazz Artist\u201d nominee in 2002 and Diversify spent many weeks on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz chart, TIZER has a multi-genre, multi-national appeal that expands beyond just jazz enthusiasts. Their diverse resume includes performance slots alongside Zappa Plays Zappa, Jethro Tull, Isaac Hayes, Al Jarreau, Spyro Gyra, George Benson, Soulive, Babyface, Bruce Hornsby and Robin Thicke. Those who haven\u2019t yet experienced TIZER\u2019s intensity, expansive arrangements and exciting soloing in concert got the next best thing with the group\u2019s 2010 debut release TIZER Live, which captured the vibrant interaction of what Lao calls \u201cthe ultimate cultural and musical melting pot\u201d; Italian-American New Yorker Minucci, African American violin great Karen Briggs (Yanni, Stanley Clarke, Chaka Khan) and Cuban born drummer/percussionist Raul Pineda (Michel Camilo, Chucho Valdes), in addition to Kollman, multi-instrumentalist Steve Nieves (Kenny Loggins, Loggins & Messina, Jagno) and Lao himself, who grew up in Boulder, Colorado. Bassist Rufus Philpot, who joined TIZER after that recording, hails from London. The concert recording at the world renowned Musicians Institute in Hollywood was TIZER\u2019s very first live performance as a group; it included fresh interpretations of seven songs from Lao\u2019s earlier recordings, including Diversify and Golden Soul (2001). Downbeat marks the first time that Lao has co-produced one of his albums. Loving the big sound of the band and all the intricacies it has in the live setting inspired his simple concept when it came time to write and record the album. \u201cProducing and mixing with Jeff, my goal was to give listeners a taste of the energy TIZER creates in the live setting, so most of the recording was done live in the studio,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile no solo on disc can capture what happens onstage, we wanted Downbeat to have the same blend and balance via strong, detailed arrangements and studio production.

De son parcours singulier, on retiendra 1000 choses, entre des \u00e9clats de vie percutants et une foi presque divine, rayonnante, qui caract\u00e9rise un personnage au parcours singulier, \u00ab entre l\u2019ombre et la lumi\u00e8re \u00bb. Celui d\u2019un jeune homme destin\u00e9 \u00e0 une carri\u00e8re de hockeyeur, stopp\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9lan, \u00e0 18 ans, par une blessure redout\u00e9e, redoutable. Un passage compliqu\u00e9, impos\u00e9, qui le conduira vers le Pacifique, de l\u2019Australie aux \u00eeles Fidji, en passant par la Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande. De cette travers\u00e9e formatrice, indispensable, vitale presque, durant laquelle Fr\u00e4nk perfectionnera son anglais, il conservera des souvenirs, touchants et personnels ; des m\u00e9lodies, vibrantes et chaleureuses ; des images, sensibles et profondes. De quoi repartir de z\u00e9ro, tout en gardant les acquis de ses ann\u00e9es sportives : la rigueur, un sens aigu du travail, une ligne directive d\u00e9finie et pr\u00e9cise, concr\u00e8te ; des atouts ind\u00e9niables pour celui qui, naturellement, troqua sa crosse contre une guitare.Un instrument \u00e0 part, pour Fr\u00e4nk, \u00e0 partir duquel tout a fini par se reconstruire. Gr\u00e2ce auquel tout a recommenc\u00e9. Cet instrument si fort, indomptable et finalement dompt\u00e9, devenu le compagnon ind\u00e9fectible d\u2019une carri\u00e8re b\u00e2tie sur la route. Entre ses cordes raides, toujours sur le fil, son acoustique radieuse et sa folie \u00e9lectrique (le guitariste aime \u00e0 citer Electric Ladyland, troisi\u00e8me album de Jimi Hendrix, artiste absolument libre qui a tellement compt\u00e9 sur le chemin du Parisien). En bref, le coup de foudre d\u2019une vie. Sans pour autant perdre de vue des objectifs essentiels, en guerrier tranquille, Fr\u00e4nk poursuit son ascension, entre les cordes de sa gratte et ses autres vocales, d\u2019une douceur contagieuse, qui le poussent \u00e0 chanter, comme sur l\u2019excellentissime Fou, titre doux mais tranchant, bilan d\u2019une vie d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien remplie, \u00e0 seulement 28 ans. Des airs chauds, chaleureux, plein d\u2019enseignements chant\u00e9s dans des refrains fonci\u00e8rement soul (le titre \u00e9ponyme Dans la T\u00eate en est la magistrale d\u00e9monstration), que ce Parisien de naissance apprendra \u00e0 bras-le-corps, trouvant dans cette discipline un exutoire inesp\u00e9r\u00e9 et passionnant. Au point de retrouver sur sc\u00e8ne les m\u00eames sensations que sur la glace, lorsque le gar\u00e7on gardait les cages de son \u00e9quipe. Un revirement profond, rendu possible gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une force de caract\u00e8re commune aux grands sportifs, traduite ici dans une volont\u00e9 acharn\u00e9e, chevill\u00e9e au corps, de vivre de sa passion, co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte. Une puissance d\u2019esprit, toujours en \u00e9veil, que l\u2019on retrouve dans l\u2019\u0153uvre de Fr\u00e4nk, tout au long de son premier ep 6 titres, intitul\u00e9 Dans la t\u00eate, sorte de recueil o\u00f9 le blues et le funk se retrouvent autour d\u2019un groove v\u00e9ritablement captivant (comme sur le titre d\u2019ouverture, Down). En alternant les morceaux calmes et ceux dansants, en m\u00ealant des textes forts et d\u2019autres plus l\u00e9gers, Fr\u00e4nk convoque sur un seul et m\u00eame disque toutes ses influences, de Stevie Wonder \u00e0 Michael Jackson, en passant par Amos Lee, Ben Harper ou les trois King : Albert King, B. B. King et Freddie King. Des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences propres \u00e0 ce personnage attachant, zen mais d\u00e9termin\u00e9, bien entour\u00e9 (on parlera de Spleen & The Black and White Skins, des membres de Namaste, de Hugh Coltman et beaucoup d\u2019autres), boulevers\u00e9 par la profondeur de la musique noire am\u00e9ricaine, qui parle de chansons avec une application d\u2019orf\u00e8vre. Comme si la glace de son enfance avait progressivement fondu pour mieux enflammer la \u00ab nouvelle \u00bb sc\u00e8ne. Laur\u00e9at du SFR Jeunes Talents, il obtient sa carte pour jouer aux Francofolies de La Rochelle. Apr\u00e8s avoir suivi James Hunter sur la route lors de sa tourn\u00e9e en 2013, Fr\u00e4nk eu l'honneur d'ouvrir entre autres pour Meshell Ndegeocello, Keziah Jones, Dr John, Ziggy Marley, Robert Cray ou encore Raul Midon puis d'accompagner Hugh Coltman lors du Festival 36 heures de Ste Eustache. il est laur\u00e9at du prix des Musiciens du M\u00e9tro et participe \u00e0 Solidays en 2014 sous la tutelle de Patrice et Hollysiz. En 2015, Paul Personne le prend sous son aile et l'embarque sur sa tourn\u00e9e \u00e0 travers la France. Comme si ca ne suffisait pas, il est invit\u00e9 au Tahiti Guitare Festival \u00e0 Papeete aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s d'Oldelaf et Amandine Bourgeois. Un parcours d\u00e9j\u00e0 riche pour ce jeune trentenaire, chanteur \u00e0 part sur l\u2019\u00e9chiquier local et qui pourrait bien faire parler de lui au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res de l\u2019hexagone.", "otherInfo": "Slim's Presents HorrorPops with The Quakes and Frank & Deans"}, {"Address": "1558 Leavenworth St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Joey Avery", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9508261.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.416461, 37.795536], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "House Party", "moreBioInfo": "After starting his career in Cape Town, South Africa Joey Avery brought his positive and energetic brand of comedy to San Francisco and received the Jimmy Gunn award for Best Newcomer to the Bay Area comedy scene.

Bass, Bass, House, Drum, Dubstep, Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "1015 Folsom", "moreBioInfo": "From hearing one of his tracks for the first time inside a club in 2003 ('Strobe', rewound twice by Andy C at The End) to headlining Glastonbury in 2010 (Saturday night on the fabled Glade stage to a rapturous reception), Nick Douwma's rise through the ranks of underground jungle to become a major player in electronic music has been nothing short of spectacular. Initially known for air-punching, dancefloor dismantling drum & bass, Sub Focus has now become synonymous with music that draws from all corners of the electronic landscape, and has come to epitomise the \u2018anything goes\u2019 mantra of todays flourishing dance scene. London born and bred, Douwma\u2019s rise into the furthest reaches of the dance music stratosphere began when he first encountered jungle, at high school in the mid-Nineties. A friend played him a cassette featuring General Levy\u2019s hit \u2018Incredible\u2019 and Douwma, at that point playing bass in a rock band, was completely taken under it\u2019s spell. Shortly after this first introduction, The Prodigy - who were beginning to meld rock and dance music in new and exciting ways - also became a massive influence and the young Sub Focus began to lose interest in his studies and started spending more and more time in his bedroom in Holloway, creating music. His ascent turned onto a steep axis, when in 2003, he signed his first tunes to d&b\u2019s biggest label Ram Records, off the back of a CD:R handed to label boss Andy C by one of his friends whilst drunk. Despite this inauspicious introduction, so impressed was the legendary DJ by the music on it, he duly signed every track and invited Douwma to join the Ram family. Sub Focus\u2019 tunes - expansive, fiercely creative, but made with the scientific precision of a military warhead - immediately stood out from the crowd and were soon being rotated by every major DJ in the scene, garnering airplay on mainstream radio, and drawing fans from throughout the globe. Singles like \u2018Airplane\u2019, \u2018X-Ray\u2019 (which reached number 60 in the national charts) and an all-conquering remix of The Prodigy\u2019s \u2018Smack My Bitch Up\u2019 meant that by 2007, Douwma was one of the biggest names in drum & bass. The next logical step was an album. But as he\u2019s shown throughout his short career already, Douwma wanted to push himself further and create something that was more encompassing than the often insular confines of drum & bass. Drawing on his love of all strains of dance music, from 80s synth pioneers Vangelis and Jean Michel Jarre, through dance leviathans The Chemical Brothers, to futuristic house and techno acts like Lindstrom and Matthew Dear, his eponymous debut album released in 2009 featured not only drum & bass but dubstep, old school breakbeat, bumping house and lashings of electro and rock, all brought together in a taut collection that could only have been made in the 21st century. It was an instant hit. The monstrous, Daft Punk-influenced album opener and first single \u2018Rock It\u2019 broke into the Top 40, with second single \u2018Could This Be Real\u2019 doing similar damage. The stunning 'Splash', featuring the vocals of Coco Sumner soon followed, and due to insatiable demand Douwma was called in to remix the likes of Deadmau5, Empire of the Sun and Dizzee Rascal by the end of 2009. The walls and boundaries that once separated the different areas of dance music for so long have seemingly disappeared in the Noughties, destroyed by a new generation of clubbers and producers who are creating and consuming music in a completely different way. Sub Focus\u2019 sound is the perfect reflection of this, with all categories of electronic beats brought together into a luminous, cosmic melting pot. He recently co-wrote and produced the track 'Kickstarts' for UK solo artist Example, which peaked at number 3 in the national charts, and he has also transferred his debut album into a stunning live show, playing festivals throughout the world, joining Pendulum on tour, and in 2010 wowing the revellers at Glastonbury. The unforgettable show on the Glade stage was in many ways a conclusion to the first chapter in Sub Focus' story. He has conquered drum & bass, created a ground-breaking, era-defining album, and has brought new school dance music further into the mainstream spotlight thanks to his unmissable live show. Douwma is already hard at work creating his sophomore long player, and given his track record thus far, it may well revolutionize dance music all over again. But then, would you expect anything less?

After a string of shows, opening for the likes of the Reverend Horton Heat, the Toasters, and New Cold War, the band decided to reluctantly persuade Ryan \"Arpee Sampson III\" Sampson to move from the landlocked paradise of Boise, Idaho, to Las Vegas, in September of 2014. This addition brought a third harmony, and mediocre guitar playing, that has enticed the fans to walk out the door to this day. Their combination of Ska, Punk, and songs of yesteryear has been enough to make \"Old Blue Eyes\" turn grey. In October of 2015, they released \"How Did You All Get In My Room\", on Squidhat Records, to mild reviews.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1030 Main St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Avery Sunshine", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8706510.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: R&B Soul", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Napa", "moreBioInfo": "Avery*Sunshine is an American Soul, R&B, Gospel Singer that tours internationally.

Over the past two decades they have evolved into what The Guardian called \u201cone of the world\u2019s finest Afrobeat bands\u201d while enjoying equal renown for their cross-genre collaborations with legends of popular music. With a heavy balance of experience and new blood, the group leaps into 2020 with their new Daptone Records full-length \u201cFu Chronicles.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1998 by saxophonist Mart\u00edn Perna, early incarnations of the group included several members of The Dap-Kings including bassist / producer Gabriel Roth, guitarist Binky Griptite, keyboardist Victor Axelrod, conguero Fernando \u201cBugaloo Velez,\u201d and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi. As the group expanded, it absorbed younger musicians from the Daptone family including bassist Nick Movshon (El Michels, Black Keys) and other musical natives and transplants from downtown Manhattan and North Brooklyn music scenes.\n\nIn 1999, Perna and Roth dropped in at an atelier / dojo belonging to Duke Amayo. They invited him to a neighborhood concert and then reached out to him later as an emergency substitute for a show. Amayo soon became a fixture in the group, first on percussion, then later on vocals, vibraphone, and keyboards and moving to center stage as the group\u2019s frontman and creating the Afro-Spot, the band\u2019s headquarters as well as the home of the first Daptone Records studio.\n\nOver the next few years, the band performed several times a month throughout NYC at the Afro-Spot, at benefits, lofts, block parties, and at their Lower Manhattan weekly residency called \u201cAfricalia\u201d with regular appearances by friends including Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and The Sugarman Three. After their second release, \u201cTalkatif\u201d (2002, Ninja Tune), the group began touring heavily throughout North America and Europe including performances at Glastonbury, Montreux Jazz Festival, Coachella, Bonnaroo, and the Newport Jazz Festival. Over the years, expanded their travels to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South America, and most recently, Hong Kong.\n\nIn the late 2000s, after nearly ten years of road touring, Antibalas was chosen by choreographer Bill T Jones, to serve as the band for the Tony-award winning Broadway musical \u201cFela.\u201d Around the same time, the band began to draw the attention of the Roots. The two groups joined with Public Enemy to perform a live version of the entire \u201cIt Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back\u201d at the 2009 Roots Picnic as well as the Red Bull Battle of the Bands, as well as numerous guest appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\n\n\nAntibalas has also served as the house band for several star-studded tribute shows at Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theater paying tribute to the music of Aretha Franklin, David Byrne, Paul Simon, and Billie Holiday, backing dozens including Allen Toussaint, Cee Lo Green, Sharon Jones, Santigold, and Angelique Kidjo.\n\nOver the years, different members have traded production and composition duties from album to album. On the new album\u2014\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d\u2014Amayo leads us through a thrilling sonic journey of kung fu meets Afrobeat, weaving together the strands of Edo and Yoruba cultural memory from Nigeria with his training and study in Chinese martial arts.\n\nRecorded in the Summer of 2018, over seventeen musicians and singers crammed into the storied Daptone House of Soul in Bushwick to record the massive body of work. With live versions and arrangements stretching up to thirty minutes, Perna, Amayo, and Roth worked tirelessly to preserve the hypnotic power of the long-form live arrangements into six concise and powerful album tracks.\n\n\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d will be the eighth studio album from Antibalas, who have been releasing music over four decades; Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1 (1999), Talkatif (2002), Who Is This America?

He draws influence from the music of his upbringing; urban hip-hop, R&B, and rock, and combines them with the affluent Latin rhythms. His roots in the Latin power vocal style produce warm, beautiful tones as he exhales his melodies. Carlos Xavier is his name and singing is his game!\n\nCarlos engages his audience with his pure, passionate vocals. Backed by his band and his years of musical experience Carlos is able rise up and shine. His music has taken his groups all over the world. He has played with Los Mocosos at the East Coast Blues and Roots Festival in Australia as well as throughout the Caribbean as a cruise ship entertainer. Carlos has toured throughout the United States as well as Canada. When not on the road Carlos can be heard throughout nightclubs weekly.\n\nThe past years have served to educate and develop Carlos\u2019 talent as he currently heads his solo career. The result is outstanding musicianship and a fully developed, unique sound. His sound is very identifiable to the Latin American community as it draws from Latin Balada roots and meshes them with the rock and pop. His melodies are expressed through his passionate lyrics and his desire reach people\u2019s souls. The music world eagerly awaits the new sound of Carlos Xavier.\n\nCarlos Xavier fused his original songs with a New York salsa producer and East coast musicians, to create a unique style of salsa putting it in a league of its own. This salsa album ranges from R&B, Rock, Hip-Hop, Gospel, Blues, Vallenato to Latin Pop all within the rules of salsa. An album for all types of listeners to enjoy. I made an album to make you dance, laugh, sing, cry and simply to enjoy listening to. A must for DJ\u2019s and salsa music lovers.\n\nWhen I fell in love with salsa, about 22 years ago, it became my dream to make a salsa album. Especially using the musicians and producers that made the style of salsa that I loved. I never believed it would happen but it did. With this album I plan to bring that style of salsa back that I heard many years ago and make it relevant to today, all while making it my own.\n\nI grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a melting pot of cultures so I had many genres of music in my ear. My song writing style shows that and I\u2019m very proud of it. A first generation born American to parents born in Nicaragua, my Latin roots will always be who I am, and I feel fortunate to have grown up in an era where many styles of urban music were being brought to life. So I reflect that in my writing and want to offer the world my sound as a singer/songwriter.", "otherInfo": "Performing songs from his new album - VIVE TODO AHORA\n\n\"SPECIAL VALENTINE'S DAY PERFORMANCE\"\n\nFIRST SET OF ROMANTIC BOLERO DINNER MUSIC\n\nCARLOS XAVIER LIVE @ THE SEAHORSE in SAUSALITO\n\nSEAHORSE\n\n305 Harbor Ave.\n\nSausalito, CA 94953\n\n8PM - 11:45pm"}, {"Address": "55-A, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "John Rybak", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10069441.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.49, 37.65], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Americana", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Pedro Point Brewing", "moreBioInfo": "John is an established professional musical performer and plays acoustic shows around the San Francisco area.

They became a very well-known and popular band in the Bay area in the mid-sixties. At first they played mainly r&b, but later started to add Latin music to the mix.\n\n\nThree or four years into the career of the Malibus, a guitarist was brought in by the name of Jorge Santana, the brother of the already famous Carlos Santana. In 1970 the Malibus changed their name to Malo and things started happening. At times numbering as many as ten or more musicians, Malo's powerful sound was different to that of Santana in that the line-up included a serious horn section, which included, at various times, leading trumpet player Luis Gasca, as well as percussionists Coke Escovedo, Francisco Aguabella, Victor Pantoja and Richard Bean (of Sapo fame).\n\n\nThey were signed to Warner Brothers Records and recorded their first album, which was simply entitled \"Malo\" (BS-2584). Arcelio co-wrote four of the six songs, including their classics \"Nena\" and \"Cafe.\" Released in 1972, \"Malo\" also included \u201cSuavecito,\" which had evolved from a song they had written and been doing in clubs called \u201cMy Love.\u201d\n\n\nOne of the band members at the time, Richard Bean, wrote a new lyric which gave birth to a major hit record. Malo members Pablo Tellez and Abel Zarate also got credit for the composition.\n\n\nWarner Brothers released Malo's second album, \"Dos\" in 1972, followed by \"Evolution\" in 1973. Illness kept Arcelio Garcia out of the group for a year in 74-75. This was the period when Little Willie G., formerly of Thee Midniters of East L.A., came in and became lead singer for Malo. Willie did one album entitled \u201cAscenci\u00f3n\u201d and toured with the band. This album was Malo's last with Warner Brothers.\n\n\nBack in good health, Arcelio, who owns the Malo name and logo, moved to New York and started Malo anew. This resulted in the release of Malo V in 1981. Arcelio then came back to the West Coast, where he has been based ever since.\n\n\nMalo's current lineup includes:\n\nArcelio Garcia, lead vocals; Ramiro Amador, bass; David George, drums; Gabriel Manzo, lead guitar; Jay Rossette, 2nd lead guitar; Daniel Cervantes, keyboards; Frank Bailey, lead trumpet; Pete Rodriguez, trumpet, trombone; Jack Musgrove trumpet, flogahorn; and Tony Menjivar, congas / timbales. Another addition to the current Malo is Arcelio\u2019s son, Octaviano, an excellent singer and performer in his own right.\nSite Designed by Skipnosis Studios", "otherInfo": "Gold Circle / VIP: VIP bag includes an Event poster, VIP Laminate and Lanyard, and a Love Jam T-Shirt to be picked up on the concourse the night of the show. **Scheduled to perform: Midnight Star, Rose Royce, Heatwave, Color Me Badd, Ready For The World, Club Nouveau, Evelyn \"Champagne\" King, Malo, Ray Goodman & Brown, and The Moments Artists subject to change."}, {"Address": "44 Race St, San Jose, CA 95126", "Artist": "Individ\u00fao", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.911581, 37.330495], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Art Boutiki", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "20990 Homestead Rd, Cupertino, CA 95014", "Artist": "VISCERAL DISGORGE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8014052.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.040382, 37.336297], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Death Metal", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Homestead Bowl & The X Bar", "moreBioInfo": "From the violence-ridden bowels of Baltimore emerges VISCERAL DISGORGE vomiting forth their debut album INGESTING PUTRIDITY.

The founding members were schoolmates David Hinds (the primary songwriter as well as the lead singer and guitarist), Basil Gabbidon (guitar), and Ronnie \"Stepper\" McQueen (bass). All of them came from working class West Indian immigrant families, and none had much musical experience. They took some time to improve their technical proficiency, often on Roots inspired material by the Wailers, Burning Spear and several other prominent Jamaican artists. McQueen suggested the group name, after a racehorse, and they soon fleshed out the lineup with drummer Steve \"Grizzly\" Nisbett, keyboardist/vocalist Selwyn \"Bumbo\" Brown, percussionist/vocalist Alphonso \"Fonso\" Martin, and vocalist Michael Riley.\n\nSteel Pulse initially had difficulty finding live gigs, as club owners were reluctant to give them a platform for their \"subversive\" Rastafarian politics. Luckily, the punk movement was opening up new avenues for music all over Britain, and also finding a spiritual kinship with protest reggae. Thus, the group wound up as an opening act for punk and new wave bands like the Clash, the Stranglers, Generation X, the Police, and XTC, and built a broad-based audience in the process. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Steel Pulse developed a theatrical stage show that leavened their social commentary with satirical humor; many of the members dressed in costumes that mocked traditional British archetypes (Riley was a vicar, McQueen a bowler-wearing aristocrat, Martin a coach footman, etc.). The band issued two singles -- \"Kibudu, Mansetta and Abuku\" and \"Nyah Love\" -- on small independent labels, when they then came to the attention of Island Records after opening for Burning Spear.\n\nSteel Pulse's first single for Island was the classic \"Ku Klux Klan,\" which happened to lend itself well to the band's highly visual, costume-heavy concerts. It appeared on their 1978 debut album, Handsworth Revolution, which was soon hailed as a classic of British reggae by many fans and critics, thanks to songs like the title track, \"Macka Splaff,\" \"Prodigal Son,\" and \"Soldiers.\" Riley departed before the follow-up, 1979's Tribute to the Martyrs, which featured other key early singles in \"Sound System\" and \"Babylon Makes the Rules,\" and solidified the band's reputation for uncompromising political ferocity. That reputation went out the window on 1980's Caught You, a more pop-oriented set devoted to dance tracks and lovers rock. By that point, Steel Pulse was keen on trying to crack the American market, and went on tour over Island's objections. Caught You was issued in the States as Reggae Fever, but failed to break the group, and they soon parted ways with Island.\n\nSteel Pulse moved on to Elektra/Asylum, which released an LP version of their headlining set at the 1981 Reggae Sunsplash Festival. Their studio debut was 1982's True Democracy, a generally acclaimed set that balanced bright, accessible production with a return to social consciousness. It became their first charting LP in America, making both the pop and R&B listings. The slicker follow-up, Earth Crisis, was released in 1984 and featured producer Jimmy \"Senyah\" Haynes subbing on guitar and bass for founding members Gabbidon and McQueen, both of whom left the group by the end of the recording sessions. They were replaced by guitarist Carlton Bryan and bassist Alvin Ewen for 1986's Babylon the Bandit, another Haynes-produced effort that ranked as the group's most polished, synth-centered record to date. It featured the powerful \"Not King James Version\" and won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album.\n\nIn 1988, Steel Pulse released State of Emergency, their most explicitly crossover-oriented album yet. They also contributed the track \"Can't Stand It\" to the soundtrack of Spike Lee's classic Do the Right Thing. In 1991, they released another heavily commercial album, the Grammy-nominated Victims, which featured the single \"Taxi Driver.\" Backing up the song's views, Steel Pulse filed a class-action lawsuit against the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging that drivers discriminated against blacks and particularly Rastafarians. Founding member Fonso Martin left that year, reducing Steel Pulse to a core trio of Hinds, Nisbett, and Brown. Their backing band still featured Ewen and was elsewhere anchored by guitarist Clifford \"Moonie\" Pusey, keyboardist Sidney Mills, trumpeter Kevin Batchelor, Saxophonist Jerry Johnson and Trombonist Clark Gayton.\n\nThe 1992 live album Rastafari Centennial marked the beginning of a return to the group's musical roots, and earned another Grammy nomination. The following year, they performed at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration, the first reggae band to appear at such an event. 1994's studio album Vex completed Steel Pulse's re-embrace of classic roots reggae, though it also nodded to contemporary dancehall with several guest toasters and a digital-flavored production. 1997's Rage and Fury continued in a similar vein, and was nominated for a Grammy. In 1999, the group released another collection of live performances, Living Legacy.\n\nFast forward a long seven years since their previous album, Rage and Fury, Steel Pulse would return yet again, this time with African Holocaust, and yet again have their ranks dwindled. Core members David Hinds (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Selwyn Brown (keyboards, backing vocals) are the only ones to remain from the band's original line-up, but they more than hold their own and they're joined by a deep roster of supporting musicians, a list too long to list. As always, the music is what's most important, and on that count, this Steel Pulse lineup indeed makes the mark. Granted, it did take them seven years to get the album out, but still it won a Grammy Awards Nomination for Best Reggae Album of the year. There's really not too much else to say about African Holocaust. Longtime fans will know what to expect. Newcomers should know a few things: above all, Steel Pulse are known for performing well-written, Afrocentric songs that are rebellious without being negative or inflammatory, and though the band membership has changed over the years, the type of songs hasn't, nor has the steady move away from dancehall that was apparent on the band's previous album. the message and music remain true to the band's principles and vision.\n\nSteel Pulse is one of Britain's greatest reggae bands, in terms of creative and commercial success. Steel Pulse started out playing authentic roots reggae with touches of jazz and Latin music, and earned a substantial audience worldwide. Their 1978 debut, Handsworth Revolution, is still regarded by many critics as a landmark and a high point of British reggae. By the late '80s, Steel Pulse had won a Grammy and were working full-fledged crossover territory. They subsequently returned to a tough-minded, rootsy sound and have added touches of dancehall and hip-hop along the way.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Wy, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "JOE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619745.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: R&b/soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakland Arena", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Performers subject to change"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Sugar Candy Mountain", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9211616.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Pop, Psychedelic Rock, Indie, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "A space-age blast of psychedelic pop and Tropicalia that sounds like it could have reverberated right out of Phil Spector\u2019s echo chamber.\n\nIf Brian Wilson had dropped acid on the beach in Brazil and decided to record an album with Os Mutantes and The Flaming Lips, it would sound like this\u2014 featuring space-age sounds and far-out frequencies from the tripped our tropics.", "otherInfo": "Panache's Valentine's Day Village of Love Planned Parenthood Benefit Show\n8 pm doors\n$20 adv / $25 doors\nall ages"}, {"Address": "1000 Great Hwy, San Francisco, CA 94121", "Artist": "Johnny Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.510542, 37.769815], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Johnny Smith at Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant: The occasional jazz bands that play at the Beach Chalet may try valiantly to compete for attention with the Chalet's menu (full dinner served until 11 p.m.), handcrafted brews, and striking coastal view - but with vistas of the Pacific Ocean as epic as these, the musicians face a losing proposition.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Jai Uttal and the Pagan Love Orchestra", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/130290.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jai Uttal and the Pagan Love Choir"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Nascar Aloe", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9959131.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rap, Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Enigmatic North Carolina native Nascar Aloe has placed himself firmly at the forefront of the underground rap scene with his unique and captivating blend of punk energy, raw 808s and terrifying visuals.

Six virtuosic voices united in crystal clear harmony, against a backdrop of syncopated rhythms, innovative arrangements, and funky grooves that bubble into an intoxicating brew of gospel, jazz, R&B, and pop. With praise from such luminaries as Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Brian Wilson, Ella Fitzgerald and Whitney Houston, the multi-platinum selling sextet has toured across the globe, collaborated across genres, and is recognized as the pre-eminent a capella group in the world.\n\n\n\nWith the popularity of televised vocal competitions such as the explosive a cappella show The Sing Off and the mania over singing driven comedy-dramas like Glee and Smash, Take 6 is the original torchbearer.

At Walmart's 50th Anniversary celebration, Take 6 captivated the audience with their rendition of the Louis Armstrong hit, What A Wonderful World.

Two weeks later at the behest of legendary Producer Phil Ramone, Take 6 thrilled a sold-out audience at the Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards performing with and honoring legendary singer-songwriter Ben E.

When tenor Mark Kibble heard the group rehearsing in the dorm bathroom, he joined in the harmonies and performed on stage that night. When Mervyn Warren joined shortly afterward, they took the name Alliance. Yet, when they signed to Reprise Records/Warner Bros. in 1987, they found that there was another group with the same name, so they became Take 6. Says McKnight: \"Take 6 was all about a democratic process of sitting in a room together and throwing a couple of hundred names at each other and Take 6 was the one that got the most yay votes [laughing.] It pretty much was a play on the Take 5 jazz standard and the fact that there are six of us in the group, so it became Take 6.\" Their self-titled debut CD won over jazz and pop critics, scored two 1988 Grammy Awards, landed in the Top Ten Billboard Contemporary Jazz and Contemporary Christian Charts, and they've never slowed down.\n\n\n\nWhat makes the music and the group last this long? The answers are direct and simple: faith, friendship, respect, and love of music. Such qualities garnered them awards beyond musical category - a Soul Train Award and two NAACP Image Award nominations. From their exceptional live performances to their recordings, these qualities remain at the heart of the Take 6 phenomenon.\n\n\n\nOne, Take 6's recent recording on Shanachie, is notable for three reasons. First, it's the group's return to their spiritual heritage. Second, it is their first project without Cedric Dent, who retired from full-time touring with the group last year. \"Cedric had taken a position with MTSU (Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, TN) which didn't allow him to go out on the road during the school year and kind of limited him only to the weekends and that's if it worked for the schedule,\" says Kibble. \"So we decided it was best to find a person to step in and cover him when he couldn't be there. Third, it introduces Khristian Dentley as a full-time permanent member of Take 6. Kibble continues, \"We actually had a pool of three people we used over the years. Khristian was one of those people called on to step in. He did it beautifully and had a lot of energy. In standing in for Cedric, we were able to learn his personality and he was able to learn the music. After 7 years, Cedric decided to go full time into academia and when he did, Khristian was already primed to step in behind him.\"\n\n\n\nAs Take 6 celebrates their 25th Anniversary with a brand new show, they'll share the memories in the music of the past 25 years as well as reveal what the future holds!\n\n\n\nFor more information visit: http://www.take6.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3101 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94705", "Artist": "Rachel Lark", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7617721.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.265906, 37.852987], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Singer, Songwriter, Political, Alternative, Experimental Pop Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Starry Plough Pub", "moreBioInfo": "Rachel Lark is a San Francisco based singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist.

Forged from his Memphis, (TN) gospel roots and his 1980\u2018s initiation into the thriving Houston, TX nightclub scene, Kirk\u2019s big, rich tenor sound is unmistakably his. The 80\u2019s were highlighted by Kirk\u2019s stepping out of his blossoming sideman role and forming his own band. It was there that Kirk ultimately developed both his \u201cvoice\u201d and songwriting in the crucible of the local club scene\u2013\u2013especially at a rooftop club called Cody\u2019s. It was also in Houston where jazz pianist Bob James \u201cdiscovered\u201d him and brought him on tour, which led to five successful albums with Columbia Records, including Cache, Kirk\u2019s first #1 album. As well, Kirk and Bob received a Grammy nomination for their collaboration album, Joined at the Hip. After moving to Los Angeles, Kirk became an in demand session player for top artists like, Barbara Streisand, Al Jarreau, Luther Vandross, Larry Carlton, Quincy Jones and most notably, Whitney Houston, amongst many others. It\u2019s his sax heard on the mega-hit, \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d Kirk soon followed that career high point with his phenomenal hit album released on Warner Bros.

Case in point: power-packed R&B as delivered by soulful singer/songwriter Avant. The masterful crooner is back on point with his seventh album, Face the Music (Feb. 5, 2013). Inspired by the R&B legends\u2014Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Frankie Beverly & Maze, Luther Vandross and Kenny \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds\u2014who have been guiding lights in Avant\u2019s career, the project marks the singer\u2019s first release on the Capitol/EMI-distributed independent label Mo-B. But the set does more than just pay homage to R&B masters. Thanks to Avant\u2019s inventiveness, Face the Music cooks up a tantalizing blend of contemporary and traditional sounds. \u201cIt\u2019s a taste of new school and old school,\u201d explains Avant. \u201cYou might hear a piece of, say, Stevie Wonder or Babyface, then I spin right back around and offer up some new age R&B. It\u2019s a well-rounded album with something for everyone. At the end of the day, Face the Music is about who we are and what we live by; it\u2019s about respecting that as well as the music.\u201d Jumpstarting the buzz about the forthcoming album is lead single \u201cYou & I,\u201d Avant\u2019s long-anticipated reunion with duet partner Keke Wyatt. Already a top 10 hit on Billboard\u2019s Adult R&B chart and currently climbing the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs tally, the searing love ballad revisits the natural magic Avant and Wyatt conjured on their first hit together, \u201cMy First Love.\u201d \u201cKeke was only 16 when we did \u2018My First Love,\u2019\u201d recalls Avant. \u201cI\u2019d never heard a voice like that coming from someone so young. She still possesses that same amazing spirit and soul when she sings.\u201d Avant traveled to Chicago to record Face the Music, writing every song on the 12-track set. Production collaborators included Grammy Award-winning duo Tim & Bob (Boyz II Men, TLC, Bobby V), who contributed three songs, and the trio Monopoly. The latter is comprised of Avant, Dre Hen and Kajun. Kajun, a promising newcomer signed to the L.A. Reid Music Publishing Company, produced the Ludacris hit, \u201cSex Room.\u201d In addition to hit single \u201cYou & I,\u201d Face the Music\u2019s highlights include the mid-tempo charmer \u201cBest Friend\u201d and the passion-filled \u201cMore.\u201d Another standout, \u201cWish That I Could Love You,\u201d skillfully lays out the dilemma between settling down with a significant other and still wanting to play the field. It\u2019s this skill set\u2014the ability to turn real-life situations into melodic short stories, made memorable by Avant\u2019s nuanced tenor\u2014that gives the singer his distinctive edge. \u201cI grew up on the Babyfaces and the Luthers; they made me who I am,\u201d says Avant. \u201cI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a blueprint to music, but there are certain things you have to stick by. Melody comes first for me then the story. The trick is to find a different way to tell a story every time so it feels new.\u201d Like many R&B singers, Avant got his start singing in the church choir. After attending Cleveland School of the Arts, he became the first act signed to NBA legend Magic Johnson\u2019s MCA-distributed label, Magic Johnson Music (MJM). Avant\u2019s 2000 MJM debut album, My Thoughts, spun off the Billboard No. 1 R&B hit \u201cSeparated.\u201d That was followed by the top five hit \u201cMy First Love,\u201d a cover of the 1983 Ren\u00e9 & Angela classic featuring Wyatt. Avant returned the favor on Wyatt\u2019s 2001 album debut, Soul Sista, pairing with her on the No. 4 hit \u201cNothing in This World.\u201d After scoring platinum with My Thoughts, Avant released two more platinum-certified albums, Ecstasy (2002) and Private Room (2003). He also added several more top 10 singles to his arsenal, including \u201cMakin\u2019 Good Love\u201d and \u201cRead Your Mind.\u201d Fourth album Director\u2014distributed through Geffen and the singer\u2019s final MJM project\u2014was released in 2006. It featured the hit \u201c4 Minutes.\u201d Two years later, Avant segued to Capitol for his self-titled fifth album, which yielded the top 20 single \u201cBreak Ya Back.\u201d Rounding out Avant\u2019s catalog are 2010\u2019s The Letter and the 2011 hits compilation Icon: Avant, both on Verve Forecast. A versatile singer, Avant has recorded with a diverse range of artists, including Lil Wayne and contemporary jazz multi-instrumentalist Brian Culbertson. The latter pairing resulted in the top 15 R&B hit \u201cSkies Wide Open.\u201d Avant was also among a select group of singers chosen to pay homage to R&B legend Frankie Beverly on Silky Soul Music \u2026 An All-Star Tribute to Maze featuring Frankie Beverly. He has even done some acting, appearing in the DVD release of playwright David E. Talbert\u2019s \u201cIn the Nick of Tyme,\u201d which also stars Morris Chesnut, Ellia English and Terry Dexter. As he prepares for the release of Face the Music, Avant declares that despite more than 10 years in the game, he\u2019s just getting started. \u201cI got into the game knowing this is not a sprint but a marathon.

The versatile songstress quickly followed that with a third stunning turn, this time with The World Famous Count Basie Orchestra to celebrate their new Mack Avenue recording on which she can be heard.

Most recently, Freelon could be heard returning to television: the Emmy-Award winning show Mad Men featured Freelon\u2019s voice on their Oct. 11, 2009 episode and Freelon made a touching appearance with trumpet-legend Clark Terry on In Performance At The White House to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz.

On her Grammy-nominated (for Best Jazz Vocal Performance) release, \u201cBlueprint Of A Lady: Sketches of Billie Holiday\u201d (2005), Freelon paid tribute to the quintessential jazz vocalist Billie Holiday.

Recently Freelon has teamed up with the World Famous Count Basie Orchestra, creating new music, new arrangements, and a new standard of big band vocalizing founded on musical genius, sensitive melodic renderings, and powerhouse swing. Freelon tips her hat to the fantastic vocalists who have performed with the orchestra, including Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn, adding to the scintillating Basie sounds in the new material designed and arranged for her unique style. Freelon is renowned leader in the education and healthcare fields, has served as National Spokesperson for Partners in Education, and conducts workshops, clinics, and master classes. Her workshops, from \u201cSound Sculpture\u201d to the groundbreaking \u201cBabysong,\u201d teach adults and children that you too can change the world \u2013 even one person at a time \u2013 but it takes dedication and perseverance, the substance of Freelon\u2019s educational activities.

Described by one critic as \u201csilky, seductive vocals purred beside Timbaland's jagged, hyperkinetic beats to create a uniquely edgy R&B sound,\" The Bachelor became an instant classic. \u201cPony,\u201d the daring first single, peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks for two weeks in late 1996, and reached number six on Billboard's Hot 100. In addition to the cyberfunk bounce of \u201cPony,\u201d Ginuwine\u2019s follow-up singles \u201cTell Me Do U Wanna\u201d and a blazing cover of Prince\u2019s \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d helped to make The Bachelor revolutionary. While some folks might have written-off Ginuwine as just another pretty boy destined to be a fad, he proved the naysayers wrong when he returned with the brilliant sophomore project 100% Ginuwine. Featuring the hits \u201cSo Anxious,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s So Different,\u201d \u201cSame Ol\u2019 G\u201d (which was also showcased on the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack in 1998) and \u201cNone of Ur Friends Business,\u201d music writer Matt Diehl defined the double platinum smash as \u201ca sensual peek into a futuristic bachelor boudoir of soul.\u201d The delirious 100% Ginuwine was awarded Best R&B/Soul Album at the 2000 Soul Train Awards. That same year, the disc was also nominated for an American Music Award in the Favorite Male R&B category; Ginuwine was also nominated for the same award in 2002 and 2003. Though Ginuwine\u2019s presence has been missed on the charts during his absence, he has been doing much touring both domestically and overseas. As expected, the singer is no slouch when it comes time to take it to the stage. In 2007 a supergroup was formed that consists of successful R&B singers Tyrese, Ginuwine, and Tank. Their first song was a remix of Tank's \"Please Don't Go\". The trio also appeared on Slim Thug's single \"Let Me Grind\". In an interview, Tyrese said the group would be the \"ultimate R&B fan experience. Me, Tank and Ginuwine been talking about this forever. The reason why this makes sense is that besides all of us being R&B singers, we're all good friends. Every time I see Tank, every time I see Ginuwine, we all had good energy regardless.\" In 2008 Ginuwine announced on his MySpace blog that due to label and legal issues they will not be able to release an official TGT album at the moment. On September 22, 2012, Tyrese reveal on his Twitter page that the group has been officially signed to Atlantic Records. They are currently working on their debut album. Tyrese, Ginuwine, and Tank are bringing back \u201creal R&B\u201d by making their TGT supergroup official. Ginuwine is an singer-songwriter dancer and actor with a number of multi-platinum selling albums and singles.

Rachel\u2019s rich, nuanced vocal delivery and Thu\u2019s dynamic guitar arrangements provide the backbone for the duo\u2019s eclectic and heartfelt songs that tell emotionally honest and compelling stories.\n\nTheir identities as mixed-race-Mexican-American and first-generation-Vietnamese-American (respectively) subtly inform the inclusionary, modernist perspective of their lyrics, which provide \u201csmart commentary on social attitudes\u201d (Pasadena Weekly), while their music and melodies cut across decades of classic American song forms, bending and blending genres to produce a unique sound with a fresh, clever and distinct approach to the classic traditions of American jazz, folk and blues.\n\nAfter meeting in 2006, the California-based duo began writing and performing music together. Over the course of two years, as their songwriting developed, they began to incorporate influences from different eras of jazz and pop music, which led to the creation of their unique, vibrant, \u201csophisticated but playful\u201d sound (BuzzBands LA). \u201cHis guitar shimmies and swings like Django Reinhardt while her voice wraps around each note, swaying in unison like a modern-day Ella Fitzgerald.\u201d (Nooga). And while their music hints at these vintage styles, the writing remains modern and relevant - \u201ca breath of musical fresh air\u201d (Playback: STL)\n\nIn 2012, the duo won the West Coast Songwriters International Song Contest in the Miscellaneous category for their original recording, The Art of Missing You \u2013 \u201c\u2026a delightfully poised and melancholic classic jazz ballad that Sarah Vaughan or Billie Holiday would have gladly wrapped their wounded souls around.\u201d (Americana-UK)\n\nIn 2014, The Singer and The Songwriter released their critically acclaimed, debut full-length LP, What a Difference a Melody Makes, produced by Charlie Stavish (Ryan Adams, Jenny Lewis) with mixing and mastering by Brooklyn collective, Mason Jar Music (Lucius, Feist and Andrew Bird). Debuting at #34 on the CMJ Jazz Top 40 Charts, the album has been critically praised as \u201cdiverse, confident, stylish and accomplished\u201d (Americana-UK), \u201ca revelation\u201d (Pittsburgh In Tune) and \u201can opus worthy of national attention\u201d (Playback: STL).\n\nIn March 2016, The Singer and The Songwriter released their sophomore EP, Ballads for Trying Times, produced by Griffin Rodriguez (Beirut). This latest release is being praised as \u201ca delectable listen, an emotional journey down a sullen, yet hopeful trail. Garcia and Tran bring together songs that appear written just for the listener, and no one else.\u201d (Playback: STL). The songs on the EP are described as \u201cbaroque lullabies that move along with an ease and fluidity that showcases their musical maturity and sensibility.\u201d (The Deli LA) The deeply personal record highlights the duo\u2019s strengths as writers and performers: \u201cGarcia's rich, warm voice wraps around you like the softest quilt and Tran's subdued guitar shines at all the right moments, creating somber tracks that are more than palatable and necessary.\u201d (Bitch Media)\n\nIn October 2017, the duo released their third collection of songs, DIRECTIONS. The Huffington Post says the album \"radiates gorgeously contagious melodies, palpitating rhythms and luscious harmonies and, of course, Garcia\u2019s unparalleled voice.\" In February 2018, the song, \"Give Love\" was nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Song at the 16th Annual Independent Music Awards. The duo is currently touring nationally. Of their performance at the 2018 Kansas City Folk Festival, Playlist Play writes: \"The duo creates soft melodic songs, that could just as easily exist as poems. Beautiful and full of soul and emotion, the quaint pair swept the audience away; first time listeners and long-term fans.\"\n\nIn October 2019, the duo partnered with High Plains Public Radio for the HPPR Music Ambassador Tour, a multi-city listening room tour, aiming to bring high-quality live music to the small towns and rural communities in the high plains region of the US. The HPPR Ambassador program increases community exposure to the arts and, through these intimate performances, provides these audiences with access to world-class musicians.\n\nThe duo is currently writing and recording their next full-length studio album, Dreams!

Continuously performing shows and withholding a heavy appearance schedule, Tritt is proving to be unstoppable.\n\nThe highly abbreviated Tritt timeline started when the young Marietta, Georgia native incorporated his lifelong influences of Southern rock, blues and gospel into his country during a honky-tonk apprenticeship that led him to Warner Bros. in 1989. Over the course of a decade, Travis released seven studio albums and a greatest hits package for the label. His 1990 debut Country Club and its succession of hits put him in the vanguard of the genre's early '90s boom, dubbing him as one of \u201cThe Class of \u201889,\u201d which included country music superstars Garth Brooks, Clint Black and Alan Jackson; all whom dominated the charts in the early \u201890s.\n\n\u201cCountry Club,\u201d \u201cHelp Me Hold On,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Somebody,\u201d and \u201cDrift Off to Dream\u201d peaked at numbers two and three on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts; all which led for Tritt to win Top New Male Artist award from Billboard and the CMA Horizon Award (now known as the New Artist Award). Additionally, in 1991, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) marked Tritt\u2019s debut album Country Club as certified platinum.\n\nTwo years after his debut, Travis\u2019 sophomore album, It\u2019s All About to Change, was released. Literally speaking, this album changed everything when the album shipped three million copies and all four of its singles reached the top five on the country music charts. Along with his first album, this release became triple-platinum certified by the RIAA.\n\nAt the same time, his conspicuous lack of a cowboy hat and musical assertiveness set him apart. The next series of albums, seven of which are certified platinum or higher, scored him more hit singles and led him to amass more than 30 million in career album sales, two Grammys, three CMA Awards and a devoted fan base that has filled venues coast-to-coast.\n\nHe's been a force in sports appearances, having performed at the 1996 Olympics, two Super Bowls, a World Series Game, the opening of the Georgia Dome, the final Braves game at Atlanta-Fulton Country Stadium and, in 2013, the NCAA men's basketball championship.\n\nIn 2012, Tritt formed his own label, Post Oak Recordings and shortly after released his album, The Calm After... Most recently, Tritt released a new project, a special live 2-disc CD and DVD, titled A Man and His Guitar \u2013 Live From The Franklin Theatre. The release, shot and recorded at the historic Franklin Theatre in Franklin, Tenn., spotlights Tritt\u2019s distinctively soulful voice and his exceptional guitar prowess in an intimate theater setting.\n\nIn late 2014 and throughout 2015, Tritt's compilation album, Very Best of Travis Tritt, that was originally released in 2007, saw a sales resurgence as it topped the SoundScan Top 200 Catalog Country Albums chart for over 60 consecutive weeks with 15 weeks spent at No. 1 and 35+ weeks notched in a Top 5 position, while earning RIAA certified gold status by selling over 500,000 copies. The 20-track album features some of Tritt\u2019s biggest hits, including \u201cIt\u2019s A Great Day To Be Alive,\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s A Quarter,\u201d and \u201cAnymore.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Travis Tritt, visit his website TravisTritt.com and follow him on and Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.", "otherInfo": "Travis Tritt\nPre-sale code is TRITT"}, {"Address": "180 Eureka Sq, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "I-taweh", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9572125.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.48864, 37.63265], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Reggae, Acoustic, soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Longboard Margarita Bar", "moreBioInfo": "I-taweh\n\nDonavan I-taweh Cunningham was born in the hills of St. Ann, Jamaica to Rupert and Ruby Cunningham. Like most successful artists, he comes from humble beginnings. Raised in the farming community of Prickly Pole, just a few miles from the home where Bob Marley grew in Nine Mile, he spent most of his childhood farming alongside his father and four siblings. As a young child he played music on handmade instruments crafted together from bamboo and sardine tins, only getting the chance to try out proper instruments in church when someone with a real guitar would finally set it down. Realizing her brother\u2019s love for music, his sister with combined efforts from their mother, saved her money to buy him his first guitar. For high school he moved from the country to St. Ann\u2019s Bay, where he lived on the same street as Burning Spear, and enlisted in the Ocho Rios High School band. They came second in the All Schools Competition in Kingston, giving him the confidence to move to the city to pursue music.\nIt was his move to Kingston in 1992 that began his musical career. Rarely seen without carrying his guitar, he was given the nickname Danny Gitz. Along with the name, his skill and reputation as an outstanding guitarist began to grow. During the early nineties the legendary Sugar Minott took him under his wing where he eventually became Sugar\u2019s band leader. I-taweh attributes Sugar to making him the musician he is today- \u201cSugar was like a father to me. He was the roughest, but at the same time the kindest, sweetest person. On stage he would let you know in front of thousands of people if you were messing up, but at the same time when you had it he always let us know too and made you feel good. He had a real sense of pride in his music and he was the first real reggae star who as a youth made we feel we were good enough. No matter how good you are, if you don\u2019t get the chance to show it \u2013 what can you do? He was one of the first people who made me believe in myself as a serious musician.\u201d\nIn 1994 he became part of the band High Symbol and after a tour landed in Australia with them. It was in in Australia that I-taweh began singing lead vocals here and there, and gaining some confidence as a front man. In 1998 I-taweh became the youngest member of Count Ossie\u2019s original Nyabhingi group, Mystic Revelation of Rastafari. Until 2007 he extensively toured Europe with the group where they are well known for their traditional Jamaican folk music and workshops which they held at Universities. In France, he began collaboration with reggae group Broussai which led to studio sessions in hotel rooms and the beginnings of tracks that he later used on his first album Overload.\nNot only was I-taweh in demand for live performances, his incredible versatility and precision on guitar and bass kept him in high demand in the studio as well. During the 90\u2019s he recorded with artists such as: Sade, Capleton, Morgan Heritage, Sugar Minott, Luciano, Lenky Roy, and Iqulah.\nIt was with Everton Blender, as the guitarist for the Blend Dem Band, that he came to the U.S. during 2004. After the tour, he went on to be the bassist for the Yellow Wall Dub Squad, a major backing band for Jamaican artists in the U.S. Billed as Itawe and often referred to as the Reggae Lion, he quickly gained popularity as the singing bassist opening for artists such as Sister Carol, Prezident Brown, the Abyssinians, Yami Bolo, Half Pint, the Mighty Diamonds, and the Melodians.\nIn 2009, after 17 years of being a supporting musician, I-taweh took a hiatus from the road and began to pursue his solo album. In 2011 he released his independently composed, written, and produced first album named Overload under his own label Tap Nat MuziK. In December 2011 I-taweh performed songs from his debut release at his launch party at Wickie Wackie in Bull Bay, Jamaica, as part of a great journey through Jamaica's radio and media landscape. I-taweh formed the band the Reggae Lions for the launch event enlisting veterans Nambo Robinson on trombone along with Everton Gayle on saxophone and Time aka Count Ossie Jr. on percussion. Selections from the Overload album and the Overload single have received significant airplay on numerous stations in Jamaica and both have become a 2011-2012 hit, reaching #1 on the Hot 102 FM chart. In the U.S., the Overload album has been very well-received at traditional reggae radio, college and syndicated programs and was selected to be part of the Direct TV cable network's menu of reggae material where several songs are in regular rotation. There has been considerable attention at radio and TV for Overload and the song has become popular with people of all ages.\nWith his all-star band, the Reggae Lions, he is currently touring and captivating audiences all over the world with his moving lyrics, confident stage presence, and phenomenal talent. I-taweh\u2019s unique and original sound comes from his Jamaican roots influence combined with inspirations from his travels abroad. His music is diverse and reflects his passion for Human Rights and Social Justice. Whether performing acoustic guitar with a stand- up bass, or with his full ten piece band, he is quickly winning the hearts of his listeners everywhere and continuously leaves his audience wanting more!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Nopes", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Panache's Valentine's Day Village of Love Planned Parenthood Benefit Show\n8 pm doors\n$20 adv / $25 doors\nall ages"}, {"Address": "1524 Civic Dr,, Walnut Creek, CA 94596", "Artist": "Pop Rocks", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9467247.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.062471, 37.901758], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Hip-hop, Rap, Pop, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Dan's Irish Sports Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Pop Rocks is the ultimate dance band: Tons of current high energy hits mixed with the classics from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s: Nothing but songs to keep your guests on the dance floor *all night long* from Bon Jovi to Bruno Mars and Marvin Gaye, we dig deep into classic dance songs and execute them with style and enthusiasm.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "14808 E 14th St, San Leandro, CA 94578", "Artist": "The Jets", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7513230.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.132974, 37.708728], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: 80s, Decades", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bal Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "One of the most popular family bands since the introduction of the Jackson 5 and The Osmonds, The Jets have eight top ten hits, and have sold more than five million albums worldwide.

It was also during this time that the band\u2019s label stateside began lining up synchronization opportunities that sowed the seeds for what was to come.\n\n2008\u2019s self-titled album ushered in an era where the band truly grew a global fanbase, as the record remains their top-grossing title to date and the band was able to graduate to headliner status in large venues everywhere. Toward the end of the album\u2019s initial cycle, Hollywood and the entertainment world at large came calling in a major way, largely sparked by Brad Pitt and director Bennett Miller\u2019s passionate enthusiasm for the band. The duo initially paired THIS WILL DESTROY YOU\u2019s \u201cThe Mighty Rio Grande\u201d to five crucial acts in 2011\u2019s Moneyball, with Villa Del Refugio then going into Pitt\u2019s subsequent World War Z and Miller\u2019s next film Foxcatcher. The licensing landscape exploded from there, as the band and the first two albums were represented across all major sporting events (Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup, Wimbledon, ESPYS, et al), cultural shifts (the UFC\u2019s rollout package for Ronda Rousey), Hollywood\u2019s biggest night (see: Tom Cruise introducing the nominees and awarding \u201cBest Picture\u201d over \u201cThe Mighty Rio Grande\u201d at the 2012 Oscars), and numerous Emmy-award winning dramas on television.\n\n2011 saw a change in rhythm section and an experiment in the darker capacities of the band. Tunnel Blanket features the most raw and visceral material in the band\u2019s catalog. The band stayed on the road (including a meaningful run in direct support of Deftones), issued a triple live album (2013\u2019s Live In Reykjavik, Iceland), and began formulating what would become 2014\u2019s Another Language album, an exemplar of the band and producer John Congleton\u2019s studio prowess.\n\nFrom 2016-2018, the band was able to successfully stage special tenth anniversary shows and tours celebrating Young Mountain and self-titled at high-capacity, sold out gigs around the globe, punctuated by being hand-picked by The Cure to perform in front of tens of thousands at the band\u2019s fortieth anniversary concert in London\u2019s historic Hyde Park. On the front end of that cycle, Galindo and King also managed to successfully pull off writing and recording the ambitious score to the most talked-about new restaurant of 2018, Los Angeles, Calfornia\u2019s Vespertine.\n\nTHIS WILL DESTROY YOU will return to stages this fall on a North American headlining tour. Slated to commence on October 16th in Phoenix, Arizona, the trek will wind its way through over two dozen cities, coming to a close November 17th in San Diego, California. See all confirmed dates below. The tour will follow the release of the band\u2019s fifth studio full-length, set to drop September 28th, via Dark Operative.", "otherInfo": "This Will Destroy You"}, {"Address": "3288 Pierce St. A-105, Richmond, CA 94804", "Artist": "Arsenal Efectivo", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.308541, 37.899276], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Incas Palace", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4711 Mission Blvd, Montclair, CA 91763", "Artist": "Grupo El Tiempo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6820799.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-117.7022, 34.05528], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "A Mi Hacienda De Montclair", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Rain Parade", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272365, 37.807482], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors 8:30 // Show 9 // ALL SALES ARE FINAL"}, {"Address": "2209 Broadway St, Redwood City, CA 94063-1641", "Artist": "Pride & Joy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8840639.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2293, 37.48637], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "CLUB FOX", "moreBioInfo": "Grupo Blues, Blues- Rock, Rhythm and Blues\n\nBeatriz Zaragoza - Voz\nAngel Ruiz- Guitarra\nGustavo Merlo- Bateria\nJavier Fern\u00e1ndez- Bajo", "otherInfo": "Club Fox welcomes Bay Area favorites, pop and soul virtuosos - PRIDE & JOY."}, {"Address": "2050 Gateway Pl, San Jose, CA 95110", "Artist": "Spiral Muse", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9342912.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.922763, 37.371691], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Rock, Spiritual, Indie", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Jose", "moreBioInfo": "Spiral Muse is a San Francisco-based feminist folk rock band.

This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint. She continues to tour and record as well as remaining a strong presence in her community, working with local youth as a vocal coach and mentor. She encourages them to follow their dreams to sing freely and wholeheartedly. -Written by Elle K. Productions 9x award-winning R&B/Soul music artist.

Over the last couple of years, the man originally turned on to the dance by Derrick Carter has fomented his own groove driven, emotive brand of house that now resonates around the world. Turning heads right from the off were his compilations on Deep Down and Defected, which found Sonny adding his remix flair to a bunch of classics, and after that came sophomore effort After Parties & Aeroplanes. Again a collaborative affair featuring the likes of Doorly, Gene Farris and Cajmere, it was a more jacking, sharp-edged treat designed for maximum dance floor impact, but was also stuffed with unforgettable vocals that agin saw Sonny stepping up his game.\n\n2016 saw the already influential artist stepping up yet again, this time by making his brilliant entry into the hallowed Defected In the House series. His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "Dom Dolla & Sonny Fodera"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Ultraviolet", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7651300.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412687, 37.771011], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Synth Pop, Pop", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "UltraViolet Music is the record label of international DJs and producers > Paul Thomas & Aneesh Gera.

Chasing Summer is the third project to date from the R&B impresario born Sir Darryl Farris, and marks his first release under the partnership between Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) and RCA Records. This album follows his 2018 debut LP November \u2014 which also served as his coming-out party on the roster of TDE, a stacked lineup that counts fellow musical luminaries like Kendrick Lamar and SZA in its midst \u2014 SiR is wasting no time in expanding his lovingly languid and sensual sound. Even in the constantly-innovating genre of R&B, SiR has stood head and shoulders above his peers, and Chasing Summer showcases the artistry that elevated him to the position he currently holds.\n\nAfter the release of November, SiR hit the road hard on a back-to-back-to-back tour schedule that saw him reaching audiences far and wide more than ever before. \"We didn't have any time to do anything but perform, shake hands, and kiss babies,\" he marvels. \"We had a lot of fun, and I learned a lot about myself and people in general.\" And the thematic inspiration for Chasing Summer came from those experiences on the road \u2014 SiR's interactions with others around the world, as well as what he learned about himself in the aftermath. \"It's about the duplicity that's my life,\" he explains. \u201cI walk through some of the situations I've encountered and talk about some of the things that have happened to me.\"\n\nTravel is the name of the game here, from the bag tags featured on Chasing Summer's front cover to the passport-styled imagery on the back \u2014 not to mention the album's marking of the latest stop in an artistic journey that SiR's continuing to take. \"It's an evolution,\" he states regarding the album's sound and style. \"I have my own sound that's been locked in for the last five years, but I take a lot of risks from what I'm saying and how I transition from song to song. There's a lot of growth.\"\n\nThere's a yearning at the center of Chasing Summer as well \u2014 the type of internal conflict that all ages relate to, as the seasons change and hearts become more carefree: \"I thought I was gonna find freedom on the road\u2014the freedom to do what I wanted. It's the lifestyle of summer\u2014kids think of being out of school, and adults think of taking vacation and doing what they want. It's the lifestyle they dream of\u2014where they can enjoy life and not have to worry so much about the everyday grind. On the road, I felt like I was chasing summer for sure.\"\n\nWork on Chasing Summer took place over the last four years in SiR's personal studio (\"I'm hands-on with everything\"), with some songs dating well before the auspicious debut that was November. \"We re-cut and re-mixed songs to make everything sound cohesive sonically,\" he explains on the effort to keep things fresh.

Chasing Summer is the third project to date from the R&B impresario born Sir Darryl Farris, and marks his first release under the partnership between Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) and RCA Records. This album follows his 2018 debut LP November \u2014 which also served as his coming-out party on the roster of TDE, a stacked lineup that counts fellow musical luminaries like Kendrick Lamar and SZA in its midst \u2014 SiR is wasting no time in expanding his lovingly languid and sensual sound. Even in the constantly-innovating genre of R&B, SiR has stood head and shoulders above his peers, and Chasing Summer showcases the artistry that elevated him to the position he currently holds.\n\nAfter the release of November, SiR hit the road hard on a back-to-back-to-back tour schedule that saw him reaching audiences far and wide more than ever before. \"We didn't have any time to do anything but perform, shake hands, and kiss babies,\" he marvels. \"We had a lot of fun, and I learned a lot about myself and people in general.\" And the thematic inspiration for Chasing Summer came from those experiences on the road \u2014 SiR's interactions with others around the world, as well as what he learned about himself in the aftermath. \"It's about the duplicity that's my life,\" he explains. \u201cI walk through some of the situations I've encountered and talk about some of the things that have happened to me.\"\n\nTravel is the name of the game here, from the bag tags featured on Chasing Summer's front cover to the passport-styled imagery on the back \u2014 not to mention the album's marking of the latest stop in an artistic journey that SiR's continuing to take. \"It's an evolution,\" he states regarding the album's sound and style. \"I have my own sound that's been locked in for the last five years, but I take a lot of risks from what I'm saying and how I transition from song to song. There's a lot of growth.\"\n\nThere's a yearning at the center of Chasing Summer as well \u2014 the type of internal conflict that all ages relate to, as the seasons change and hearts become more carefree: \"I thought I was gonna find freedom on the road\u2014the freedom to do what I wanted. It's the lifestyle of summer\u2014kids think of being out of school, and adults think of taking vacation and doing what they want. It's the lifestyle they dream of\u2014where they can enjoy life and not have to worry so much about the everyday grind. On the road, I felt like I was chasing summer for sure.\"\n\nWork on Chasing Summer took place over the last four years in SiR's personal studio (\"I'm hands-on with everything\"), with some songs dating well before the auspicious debut that was November. \"We re-cut and re-mixed songs to make everything sound cohesive sonically,\" he explains on the effort to keep things fresh. Along with SiR's deft studio hand, production was contributed from TDE heavy-hitters like Kal Banx, Taebeast and Sounwave, along with notable producers such as Boi-1da, Michael Uzowruru and LordQuest; on the features end, a wide range of music's finest adds some spice to the broth, from Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne to Jill Scott, recent TDE signing Zacari, Sabrina Claudio, Smino and Kadhja Bonet.\n\nLamar features on the opening track and first single \"Hair Down,\" a butter-smooth cut featuring SiR's distinctive vocals that was written on the road with the TDE crew. \"I was having a tough time adjusting to what was going on,\" he explains regarding his mindset behind writing the song.

But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\n\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\n\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\n\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\n\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\n\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\n\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\n\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\n\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\n\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

Francisco Javier Barraza Rodr\u00edguez, a quien todo el mundo conoce como Pancho Barraza, es originario de Juan Jos\u00e9 R\u00edos, Sinaloa. Desde muy peque\u00f1o mostr\u00f3 una gran inclinaci\u00f3n hacia la m\u00fasica, aunque al principio casi nadie cre\u00eda en \u00e9l. Fue hasta la edad de 22 a\u00f1os, mientras era maestro de m\u00fasica en la secundaria del poblado de Villa Uni\u00f3n, que se inicia de manera profesional al formar parte del grupo vers\u00e1til Karisma como vocalista y bajista. Al mismo tiempo, integra el coro de la iglesia del pueblo. Al poco tiempo, su talento y don para componer, lo llevan a la banda Los Recoditos, donde lo designan como su voz principal logrando destacar con sus propias canciones. Adem\u00e1s, se convierte en el creador del estilo rom\u00e1ntico en la m\u00fasica de banda y es as\u00ed que Recoditos empieza a sonar en las radios del Pac\u00edfico gracias a los temas de Pancho. Es tanta su inquietud por crear y la confianza que se tiene como cantante, compositor y m\u00fasico que en 1995 se separa de Los Recoditos para lanzarse como solista y forma su propia banda. La bautiza con el nombre de \u2018Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019. De ah\u00ed en adelante, los nombres de Pancho Barraza y su banda Santa Mar\u00eda empiezan a escucharse con gran insistencia por todo el Pac\u00edfico y parte de Estados Unidos con temas como \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d, \u201cIgnorarte Mis L\u00e1grimas\u201d, \u201cGabriela De Mis Amores\u201d, \u201cPasi\u00f3n De Amor\u201d y \u201cSanta Mar\u00eda Banda\u201d. Todos estos \u00e9xitos vienen incluidos en su primera producci\u00f3n como solista titulada \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d. En abril del 96, lanza su segundo disco compacto titulado \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, del que destacan canciones como \u201cMi Amor Y Mi Agon\u00eda\u201d, \u201cUna Tarde Como Cualquiera\u201d, la titular \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, \u201cTe Amo Y Te Lo Digo\u201d y otras. Es tanta su capacidad musical, que al a\u00f1o siguiente decide incursionar en la m\u00fasica ranchera. Forma su mariachi Santa Mar\u00eda y graba el \u00e1lbum \u201cInv\u00e9ntame Un Amor\u201d, del que se desprenden los \u00e9xitos \u201cPero La Recuerdo\u201d, \u201cSolitario Entre La Gente\u201d y \u201cCantares De Medianoche\u201d. Tanta fue la aceptaci\u00f3n que tuvo Pancho Barraza con este disco que los lugares donde se presentaba siempre estaban llenos a reventar, por lo que merecidamente se gan\u00f3 el titulo de \u201c\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u201d. En 1998, se convierte en \u201cEl Vagabundo Que Te Ama\u201d y con \u00e9ste, que fue su nuevo CD, lanza un nuevo hit a ritmo de banda: \u201cMi Enemigo El Amor\u201d, y uno m\u00e1s a ritmo de cumbia: \u201cAquella Morena\u201d. Adem\u00e1s, por primera vez graba un corrido: \u201cHistoria De Amores\u201d. En junio de 1999, vuelve a sorprender con su producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cDel Camino A La Ciudad\u201d, un disco lleno de inspiraci\u00f3n y nostalgia por los momentos dificiles que pasa cualquier ser humano. De este nuevo trabajo musical se desprenden 12 temas en los que Pancho muestra su madurez art\u00edstica y humana, ya que incursiona al mismo tiempo en g\u00e9neros como la salsa, el bolero, la balada y la cumbia. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d es el disco que el \u2018\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u2019 lanza para comenzar el a\u00f1o 2000. Por primera vez en su exitosa carrera incluye temas de otros autores. Pero les imprime su muy peculiar estilo interpretativo como es el caso de \u201cUn Indio Quiere Llorar\u201d, \u201cMi Juramento\u201d, \u201cAy Amigo\u201d, y \u201cLas Rejas No Matan\u201d, entre otros. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d tambi\u00e9n cuenta con temas de su propia inspiraci\u00f3n, como \u201cCompa\u00f1era M\u00eda\u201d, \u201cLola La Bailera\u201d, \u201cNo Va A Matarme Tu Amor\u201d y \u201cLa Vaca Pinta\u201d. Para finales de ese mismo a\u00f1o, saca \u201cUna Noche Cualquiera\u201d una producci\u00f3n musical en la que vuelve a demostrar el porqu\u00e9 se ha convertido en uno de los \u2018cantautores\u2019 preferidos del p\u00fablico, al interprerar canciones como \u201cCon M\u00fasica Rom\u00e1ntica\u201d, \u201cEl Paso De La Iguana\u201d, \u201cH\u00e1blame Claro\u201d, \u201cDebajo De Los Laureles\u201d y la que da t\u00edtulo a este disco. Pero el talento y la creatividad de Pancho no deja de fluir y para mediados del 2000, casi a la par, lanza dos producciones. Una de estas es \u201cFormas De Vivir\u201d, con la que expone su gran versatilidad como autor, int\u00e9rprete y arreglista. Se trata de un disco completo, con acompa\u00f1amiento de su propio mariachi. Incluye temas a ritmo de cumbia como \u201cTienes Que Volver\u201d, \u201cRegresa Por Favor\u201d, \u201cMi Dama\u201d y \u201cSi Por Amor\u201d. La otra producci\u00f3n a ritmo de banda se llama \u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d. Por primera vez incluye una bachata (\u201cBurbuja De Amor\u201d) y un tema a ritmo de soca (\u201cPu tun tun\u201d), cumbias (\u201cLa Roncona\u201d, \u201cEl Muerto Se Fue De Rumba\u201d y \u201cEl Toro Baquet\u00f3n\u201d) y las rancheras que tan bien le van (\u201cArr\u00e1ncame La Vida\u201d, \u201cNo Volver\u00e9\u201d, \u201cCuando Nadie Te Quiera\u201d, \u201cA La Luz De Un Farol\u201d, \u201c\u00c1nimas Que No Amanezca\u201d y \u201cEl Dinero\u201d) y una balada (\u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d). Por su trayectoria y sus logros, su nombre es muy importante para quienes realmente gustan de la m\u00fasica popular. Pancho Barraza comenz\u00f3 el nuevo milenio con la alegre producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza Y Mujeriego\u201d, grabada bajo el sello que lo ha visto crecer: Discos Musart/ Balboa Records. Con \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza y Mujeriego\u201d, sigui\u00f3 en los primeros sitios de popularidad, sonando fuertemente en las estaciones de radio y sorprendiendo a propios y extra\u00f1os por su mezcla de ritmos y gran calidad art\u00edstica, con \u00e9xitos tan inolvidables como \u201cTe Esperar\u00e9\u201d, que contin\u00faa en la programaci\u00f3n de muchas emisoras hasta siete a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno. As\u00ed se proyecta el talento de este artista excepcional, cuyo cat\u00e1logo crece cada d\u00eda en sus tres facetas principales: compositor, cantante y m\u00fasico. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n lo confirman sus grabaciones m\u00e1s recientes para Discos Musart/ Balboa Records: \u201cEn Vivo\u201d, donde se dio el lujo de que el p\u00fablico presente le hiciera un coro formado por miles de gargantas; y \u201cPancho Barraza Con El Alma En La Mano\u201d, un \u00e1lbum en que volvi\u00f3 al estilo ranchero que tanto le gusta, obviamente acompa\u00f1ado de mariachi. Ahora mismo, en este 2008 lo m\u00e1s reciente de su discograf\u00eda en Estados Unidos es su \u00e1lbum \u201cLa M\u00e1s Hermosa\u201d, donde acompa\u00f1ado de su propia banda presenta 12 nuevas canciones, todas escritas por el \u00e9l mismo. El primer corte promocional de este CD es la balada banda \u201cTe Voy A Olvidar\u201d. De emotiva letra y dentro de ese estilo caracter\u00edstico que lo identifica, este sencillo se perfila como otro gran \u00e9xito en su trayectoria.", "otherInfo": "Performers Subject to Change Panco Barraza Fidel Rueda Gerardo Coronel Estrellas De Sinaloa De German Lizarraga Doors 6pm / First Act 6:30pm"}, {"Address": "1511 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117-2912", "Artist": "Derek Evans", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9225193.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.44759, 37.76983], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Club Deluxe", "moreBioInfo": "New Single \"A Simple Song\" available soon.

They say there\u2019s an innate bond between siblings, a relationship is forged that can last a lifetime. Now, take that intuitive understanding and translate it into music; magic can happen. This is exactly the case for the brothers of Lime Cordiale, whom growing up within a creative, musical family on Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches, it was natural for the pair to make music together.\n\nLime Cordiale express their feelings that people need to break the rules in order to progress, with Oli stating \u201cyou don't have to take the conservative route. You don't need to necessarily plan out your life in your twenties or thirties\u201d. With the brothers compassionate and progressive awareness, the band are focussed on using their love of music to keep Sydney\u2019s music scene alive, along with the support from their surrounding communities and the Australian community as a whole.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the pair are passionate, and overly sensitive to the effect humans have on Australia\u2019s environment after being raised on an island home and in coastal areas while growing up. The band\u2019s vegan lifestyle and plastic free rider may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes, but their response is simply - \u201cfuck \u2018em\u201d.\nIn addition to the hectic schedule and life-band balance, Louis is an avid artist holding regular showcases, but notes that whether he is cutting lino or painting, this side of his life is kept secluded, \u201cLino cutting is a very time-consuming art form, requires a lot of attention and I find myself doing it alone\u201d says Louis. His art form though does cross over to band-life, with Louis designing all album art, posters and merchandise and states that the creative process can take time to think up ideas and sometimes his work can get so out of control he has to go into hiding, but he calls it \u201cmeditative and an escape\u201d and likes the process itself over the end result.\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t busy playing shows, cutting footage for films or designing some form of artwork, Oli and Louis return to their roots, the ocean. Though they love being close to the CBD, sometimes the inner-city pressure means they need to get back to the freedom that the ocean can give, Oli tells \u201cyou can be working in the dirt and grind of the city just behind you, but out there on the waves the world is yours\u201d.\n\nLime Cordiale received no airplay from triple j, FBI or commercial radio with the release of their debut album \u201cPermanent Vacation\u201d in Oct 2017, but this essentially underground band was in no need of the tastemaker radios support. Lime Cordiale were happy touring Australia, brewing a strong following along the way. With the release of their single \u201cDirt Cheap\u201d (Nov \u2013 18) the band exploded to the charts of triple j, then after only 3 short months the single placed #86 on triple j\u2019s infamous Hottest 100 countdown.\n\nIn Feb 2019, Lime Cordiale released their latest single \u201cMoney\u201d to accompany their fast selling tour of the same name. The extensive run of shows includes Melbourne, New Zealand and Sydney, and will continue in April to Tasmania, Adelaide, Western Australia and regional New South Wales. So far selling out every show (bar one) they\u2019ve performed (14/20 sold out) and over 5300+ tickets sold. Meanwhile the single was succeeding by its own right, featuring on Spotify\u2019s New Music Friday, iTunes\u2019 Best of the Week and by week 2 was #1 most played on triple j.\n\nThe road ahead looks bright and busy for Sydney based band Lime Cordiale, with a new album just over the horizon and a long-awaited European tour set to unite their international audiences.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "853 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Growler", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6993401.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421068, 37.759319], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Amnesia Beer & Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Growler are a 3 piece acoustic act playing a bunch of covers far too ambitious for their music ability.

Over the past two decades they have evolved into what The Guardian called \u201cone of the world\u2019s finest Afrobeat bands\u201d while enjoying equal renown for their cross-genre collaborations with legends of popular music. With a heavy balance of experience and new blood, the group leaps into 2020 with their new Daptone Records full-length \u201cFu Chronicles.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1998 by saxophonist Mart\u00edn Perna, early incarnations of the group included several members of The Dap-Kings including bassist / producer Gabriel Roth, guitarist Binky Griptite, keyboardist Victor Axelrod, conguero Fernando \u201cBugaloo Velez,\u201d and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi. As the group expanded, it absorbed younger musicians from the Daptone family including bassist Nick Movshon (El Michels, Black Keys) and other musical natives and transplants from downtown Manhattan and North Brooklyn music scenes.\n\nIn 1999, Perna and Roth dropped in at an atelier / dojo belonging to Duke Amayo. They invited him to a neighborhood concert and then reached out to him later as an emergency substitute for a show. Amayo soon became a fixture in the group, first on percussion, then later on vocals, vibraphone, and keyboards and moving to center stage as the group\u2019s frontman and creating the Afro-Spot, the band\u2019s headquarters as well as the home of the first Daptone Records studio.\n\nOver the next few years, the band performed several times a month throughout NYC at the Afro-Spot, at benefits, lofts, block parties, and at their Lower Manhattan weekly residency called \u201cAfricalia\u201d with regular appearances by friends including Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and The Sugarman Three. After their second release, \u201cTalkatif\u201d (2002, Ninja Tune), the group began touring heavily throughout North America and Europe including performances at Glastonbury, Montreux Jazz Festival, Coachella, Bonnaroo, and the Newport Jazz Festival. Over the years, expanded their travels to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South America, and most recently, Hong Kong.\n\nIn the late 2000s, after nearly ten years of road touring, Antibalas was chosen by choreographer Bill T Jones, to serve as the band for the Tony-award winning Broadway musical \u201cFela.\u201d Around the same time, the band began to draw the attention of the Roots. The two groups joined with Public Enemy to perform a live version of the entire \u201cIt Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back\u201d at the 2009 Roots Picnic as well as the Red Bull Battle of the Bands, as well as numerous guest appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\n\n\nAntibalas has also served as the house band for several star-studded tribute shows at Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theater paying tribute to the music of Aretha Franklin, David Byrne, Paul Simon, and Billie Holiday, backing dozens including Allen Toussaint, Cee Lo Green, Sharon Jones, Santigold, and Angelique Kidjo.\n\nOver the years, different members have traded production and composition duties from album to album. On the new album\u2014\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d\u2014Amayo leads us through a thrilling sonic journey of kung fu meets Afrobeat, weaving together the strands of Edo and Yoruba cultural memory from Nigeria with his training and study in Chinese martial arts.\n\nRecorded in the Summer of 2018, over seventeen musicians and singers crammed into the storied Daptone House of Soul in Bushwick to record the massive body of work. With live versions and arrangements stretching up to thirty minutes, Perna, Amayo, and Roth worked tirelessly to preserve the hypnotic power of the long-form live arrangements into six concise and powerful album tracks.\n\n\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d will be the eighth studio album from Antibalas, who have been releasing music over four decades; Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1 (1999), Talkatif (2002), Who Is This America? (2004), Security (2007), Government Magic (2011), Antibalas (2012), Where the Gods are In Peace (2017), Fu Chronicles (2020)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "DJ Dials", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.417316, 37.778083], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "18 & OVER ONLY.

Su naturalidad frente a las c\u00e1maras, combinada con su belleza tan impresionante como natural, la convirtieron enseguida en la candidata perfecta para campa\u00f1as publicitarias de su pa\u00eds. Siendo una adolescente todav\u00eda, film\u00f3 varios comerciales de ropa para la televisi\u00f3n. Con el tiempo, estas ofertas se fueron extendiendo y, en \u00e9pocas m\u00e1s recientes, ha sido el rostro para campa\u00f1as publicitarias en Am\u00e9rica Latina de grandes firmas como Avon, Degree y Gillette, por citar algunas. A principios de los 90\u2019s su mam\u00e1 la invit\u00f3 a participar en una gira de conciertos por Am\u00e9rica Latina en calidad de corista: \u201cVer a grandes masas de gente corear sus temas y manifestarle su cari\u00f1o fue algo que me marc\u00f3 para siempre.\u201d Casi al mismo tiempo, su padre tambi\u00e9n le revel\u00f3 otra parte importante de su nueva carrera: la grabaci\u00f3n de un disco. \u201cAntes de tener siquiera la oportunidad de grabar un disco, \u00e9l me revel\u00f3 todo lo que implicaba un proyecto de estos: desde las t\u00e9cnicas de grabaci\u00f3n, hasta los equipos\u2026 \u00a1Qu\u00e9 gran privilegio!\u201d En el 2004, lleg\u00f3 la oportunidad de presentar su primer disco, \u201cShaila\u201d, una colecci\u00f3n de 10 temas refrescantes con el que present\u00f3 su primera gran pasi\u00f3n: la m\u00fasica pop. Dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, con \u201cRecordando\u201d, no s\u00f3lo le rend\u00eda un homenaje a su madre interpretando los grandes \u00e9xitos de m\u00fasica ranchera que ella hab\u00eda inmortalizado, tambi\u00e9n dej\u00f3 ver cu\u00e1l era el otro gran g\u00e9nero que le encantaba: el ranchero. Ese \u00e1lbum se convirti\u00f3 en un disco de triple platino en Espa\u00f1a. El pr\u00f3ximo disco se llam\u00f3 \u201cTanto Amor\u201d, en el 2006. \u201cFue un \u00e1lbum muy pop y hasta cierto punto biogr\u00e1fico pues representaba todo lo que sent\u00eda como reci\u00e9n casada. Fue un disco maravilloso, que fue nominado al Grammy Latino.\u201d A ra\u00edz de la popularidad alcanzada en el 2008, Shaila D\u00farcal recibi\u00f3 la invitaci\u00f3n del Presidente de Estados Unidos, George W.

El t\u00edtulo del \u00e1lbum est\u00e1 directamente relacionado con sus fans: \u201cSe llama \u201cASI\u201d, porque \u201cASI\u201d, de esta manera es que quiero agradecerle los fans que me han acompa\u00f1ado todos estos a\u00f1os.

But that\u2019s definitely not the case when it comes to Luke James. And just who is Luke James? He\u2019s a singer/songwriter who truly embodies the honesty and fresh, organic soulfulness that\u2019s been in relatively short supply of late in contemporary music. Now that sounds like a pretty tall order for a newcomer to fulfill. However, the New Orleans native is very much up to the task. In fact, you\u2019ve no doubt heard his work: he co-wrote Chris Brown\u2019s \u201cCrawl\u201d and has penned songs for Justin Bieber (\u201cThat Should Be Me\u201d) and Britney Spears (\u201cKill The Lights\u201d), among others. And his growing fan base includes none other than Beyonc\u00e9, who selected James to appear in her \u201cRun the World\u201d video. James\u2019 real-deal approach to music and\u2014more important\u2014the craft of singing are the main attractions on his upcoming mix tape and album of the same name: \u201cMade to Love.\u201d Both mark the singer/songwriter\u2019s debut on Mercury/Island Def Jam via New Age Rock Star Records (NARS), the label helmed by award-winning producer Danja (Mariah Carey, Keri Hilson) and long-time collaborator / mixing engineer Marcella Araica (Madonna, Pink, Timbaland). \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fad for me,\u201d declares James. \u201cI\u2019m willing to go wherever with this because music is everything to me. This is my world and how I see it. My music speaks for me in a way that\u2019s relatable and truthful.\u201d \u201cHonest is the best word to describe Luke,\u201d adds Danja, who began working with James nearly four years ago. \u201cEvery message in his songs is sincere. And Luke\u2019s voice is another obvious factor. Putting all of that together, he possesses a universal connection that touches everyone. He\u2019s an undeniable force.\u201d That connection hits home on James\u2019 lead single, \u201cI Want You.\u201d Packed with interesting breaks and tempo shifts, the sparse yet bright track pulsates with an infectious, hip-hop-influenced beat. That foundation provides the perfect complement to James\u2019 pure, arresting falsetto as he sings: \u201cI was just a broken record of one-night stands /Til you came along with your beautiful song \u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about the voice,\u201d says Danja. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what he\u2019s captured on every record. Production doesn\u2019t matter. No matter how sparse or grand I make it, he takes control and makes it about him.\u201d James\u2019 innate talent as a singer/songwriter was nurtured in one of music\u2019s legendary outposts, New Orleans. An only child, he grew up listening to a wide array of influences thanks to his single mother: everyone from Marvin Gaye and Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes to Willie Nelson and Alabama. James\u2019 oh wow moment occurred when he was 11 years old and watching the amateur talent segment on TV\u2019s \u201cShowtime at the Apollo.\u201d One of the contestants began singing Donny Hathaway\u2019s version of writer Leon Russell\u2019s \u201cA Song For You.\u201d \u201cI got chills,\u201d recalls James. \u201cAnd I get that feeling all over again whenever I think about that performance. At the time, I\u2019d never said I wanted to be a singer; I just knew I wanted to entertain. And I\u2019d never heard of Donny. But when my mother found her copy of one of his records, I knew then that I wanted to reach people that way.\u201d While in high school in 2001, James joined a trio that started performing around New Orleans, opening for such acts as Brian McKnight. That\u2019s when James first met his longtime manager Frank Gatson. When things with the trio didn\u2019t work out, James moved to Los Angeles after graduation\u2014on the advice of Gatson\u2014and began singing background for R&B singer Tyrese. It was through the singer that James met production duo the Underdogs and signed with their label as part of a singing duo: Luke & Q. When Luke & Q decided to go their separate ways, James began honing his skills as a songwriter after hooking up with producer Danja nearly four years ago. Since then, he has collaborated on songs for Brown, Bieber, Spears, Keri Hilson and Brandy and worked alongside such other producers as Kadis and Sean and the Messengers. Inspired by those collaborations, he rediscovered his footing as a singer in his own right. \u201cI found the feeling again where I felt something fresh could come out,\u201d says James. \u201cWriting songs helped me figure out what my lane was as far as being a solo artist. And I\u2019ve also learned something else: If I don\u2019t feel it, I can\u2019t do it.

But behind the geography and moniker is a band of meticulous and literary songwriters matched by a specific brand of brooding, anthem-riding balladry and orchestral indie rock. Murder By Death\u2019s path began in the early 2000s as most Midwestern college-town groups do, by playing to small crowds at ratty venues and frenzied house parties. While many of their formative-year scene-mates failed to make it much further than campustown\u2019s borders, Murder By Death translated their anonymous beginnings into a 10+ year career founded on a bedrock of five full-length albums, tireless D.I.Y. touring and performing ethics, and, most importantly, a dedicated, cult-like fanbase. Since the band began in 2001, their audience has blossomed due in part to extended tours alongside similarly hardworking musical kin such as Against Me!, Gaslight Anthem, Lucero, William Elliott Whitmore, Ha Ha Tonka, and others. Through more than 1,000 performances across the United States, Canada and Europe, Murder By Death has gained word-of-mouth devotees and support from the likes of media outlets like SPIN Magazine, who said of the band, \u201cThey brawl like Johnny Cash\u2019s cellmates or dreamily swoon like Nick [Cave], stomping saloon floorboards in 4/4 time as grand strings fade into high noon.\u201d What resonates most with supporters is the band\u2019s energetic, unique, and altogether consistent sound and conceptualized vision. The personnel and ingredients of the group consist of Sarah Balliet\u2019s throaty cello melodies, singer/guitarist Adam Turla\u2019s booming baritone vocals and brawny guitar strumming, drummer Dagan Thogerson and bassist Matt Armstrong\u2019s locked-down, post-punk rhythm section interplay, and Scott Brackett\u2019s (formerly of Okkervil River and Shearwater) multi-instrumentalist bag of tricks (including piano, trumpet, accordion, mandolin, vocals, percussion). The overriding sound is an amalgamation of textures ranging from dark and desolate to upbeat and brightly melodic, all of it landing somewhere under the orchestrated indie rock umbrella. The other mainstay signature element of Murder By Death\u2019s identity has been built by the overriding concepts behind each individual album. Every successive effort conjures up fresh imaginative and tactile worlds \u2013 whether it\u2019s the battle between the Devil and a small Western town (Who Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them?, 2003), an arid land of death and redemption (In Bocca al Lupo, 2006), or just songs inspired by a retreat into the Tennessee mountains (Good Morning, Magpie, 2010). On September 25, the band releases their newest full-length and Bloodshot Record\u2019s debut Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon. The album was written throughout 2011 in a basement in southern Indiana, and recorded in winter 2011 in Dallas, TX with producer-in-demand John Congleton (Explosions in the Sky, St Vincent, Black Mountain). \"Just remember what old Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake.

Building a vastly loyal fan-base nationwide, fans and friends can be used interchangeably when referring to their army of followers.\n\nFor most people, it is normal to only share intimate moments with friends, but for the members of Nappy, it is no different when in their living room, studio, or on stage, as they possess the gift of honesty and deliver that message with charisma. That truthfulness is especially reflected in this compilation inspired and written for this moment in time.\n\nAfter severing ties with Atlantic Record and going independent, it was inevitable change was his own for solo efforts.

The members of Nappy Roots were facing foreclosures and a mountain of stress in the jobless economy, but still they remained positive and pushed on, while never forgetting where they came from and what they had accomplished. With fans constantly communicating with the members online and at shows, the guys realized they weren\u2019t the only ones having trouble.\n\nWith the release of their tenth mix-tape \"SH!T'S BEAUTIFUL\" and the departure of Big V from the group, as he left to pursue a solo career, Nappy Roots forges forward.

In June of 2016 he released his most personal work, \"Night Phases,\" that has been praised by music bloggers and critics as one of the best releases of the Summer.\n\nCatch Roem Baur performing on the west coast 150+ dates a year: http://roem.tv/live", "otherInfo": "ROEM (solo)"}, {"Address": "427 Mendocino Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95401", "Artist": "Samuel Gray Edmondson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9863144.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.715214, 38.441851], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Lost Church", "moreBioInfo": "Intricate fingerstyle guitar from the musical mind of a punk kid who grew up to love nature, elegant melodies, and the expressive power of the acoustic instrument.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Francesco Turrisi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8967072.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, World, Improvised Music", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SFJazz Center", "moreBioInfo": "If a musician is defined by the company he keeps then it\u2019s little wonder that Italian pianist Francesco Turrisi skirts facile categorization.\n\nThe Turin-born, Dublin-based musician has played with former Miles Davis reedsman Dave Liebman, flamenco icon Pepe El Habichuela, kaval player Theodosii Spassov and singer extraordinaire Maria Pia de Vito.

He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata.

His four beautifully crafted solo albums and two co-led releases have garnered widespread critical acclaim.\nFor Turrisi, tradition and improvisation are not different countries but two sides of the same mountain. Turrisi\u2019s musical traditions - formal and folkloric - span the centuries and a large swathe of the history of European migration. This kaleidoscopic vocabulary - always in flux - provides the grist to Turrisi\u2019s improvisational mill and the rough material from which he crafts his uniquely original, haunting music.\nHis ability to rework ancient melodies and rhythms through a contemporary jazz prism marks him out as one of the most striking voices to have emerged on the European jazz scene in the past decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Dr. Fresch", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8339928.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.417316, 37.778083], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: hip hop, electric rock, Electronic", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Bill Graham Civic Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/DrFresch\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/drfresch\nSoundCloud: https://www.soundcloud.com/drfresch\n\nMGMT - ROAR:\nrugo [at] roar.la\n\nBOOKING - CAA\nJazz Spinder\nPhil Quist: phil.quist [at] caa.com\nLogan Handelsman: logan.handelsman [at] caa.com\n\nPhoto/Video/Creative:\nalex [at] drfresch.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1665 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Bisi & The Moonwalker", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8533266.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.449896, 37.769429], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Red Victorian", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "44 Race St, San Jose, CA 95126", "Artist": "Sweet HayaH", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9118084.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.911581, 37.330495], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Funk, R&b/soul, Soul, Rock, Rnb-soul", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Art Boutiki", "moreBioInfo": "Sweet HayaH is composed of Nehal Abuelata (lead vocals/keyboard), Devin Moreno (guitar/backup vocals), Josh Gardner (drums/backup vocals), Aaron Marquez (bass/backup vocals), and Brandon Garcia (trumpet/tambourine/shakers).

No stranger to challenges, this four-man collective from Kentucky tackled their obstacles and, in the process, their self-honest work emerged in the form of 7 studio albums and 14 mix-tapes. As usual, Nappy Roots examine our alienable rights, reason, and truth through lyrical originality and voyage. Since Nappy Roots entered the music scene in 1998, they have remained real, humble, talented guys with inherent, undeniable southern swagger.\nAfter the international success of Watermelon, Chicken, & Grits, selling over 3 million albums, the members of Nappy Roots were flying high while still acutely aware of how far it could be to the bottom should they fall. It is that practical and genuine presence of mind that helped them sustain touring as a group these last ten years. Building a vastly loyal fan-base nationwide, fans and friends can be used interchangeably when referring to their army of followers. For most people, it is normal to only share intimate moments with friends, but for the members of Nappy, it is no different when in their living room, studio, or on stage, as they possess the gift of honesty and deliver that message with charisma. That truthfulness is especially reflected in this compilation inspired and written for this moment in time.\nAfter severing ties with Atlantic Record and going independent, Nappy Roots had no choice but to keep it moving and did so as smoothly as possible. As the saying goes, \u201cthe show must go on,\u201d and so it has, obstacles included. With a heavy heart and no major label record deal, Nappy Roots knew they had to remain in pursuit of their destiny and, thus, Nappy Roots Entertainment Group was formed. The members of Nappy Roots were facing foreclosures and a mountain of stress in the jobless economy, but still, they remained positive and pushed on, while never forgetting where they came from and what they had accomplished. With fans constantly communicating with the members online and at shows, the guys realized they weren\u2019t the only ones having trouble.\nWith the release of their tenth mix-tape \"SH!T'S BEAUTIFUL\" and the departure of Big V from the group, as he left to pursue a solo career, Nappy Roots forged forward. Between touring and recording, the four-man group focuses on consistently putting out quality hip-hop. A weak man with no vision, no diligence behind the vision, and no faith behind the diligence would have given up, but Skinny Deville, Fishscales, B. Stille and Ron Clutch did, can, and will handle this and more, all in the name of Nappy Roots. This is evident in their two-part Saga The 40 Akerz Project and Another 40 Akerz, released in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\nTo celebrate 20 years in the game, Nappy has earned yet another GOLD RECORD with \u201cGOOD DAY\u201d. That, along with 40 plus placements in movies and commercials, has given the group the continued propulsion to maintain the Nappy Lifestyle and connection to their fans. This has provided a perfect platform to transition into another passion. In 2018 Nappy celebrated opening their own NanoBrewery call ATLANTUCKY BREWING COMPANY and have already taken the craft beer world by storm garnering rave reviews for their first two public offerings. This journey of great beer and great music will be coming to a small screen near you with the release of \u201c40 Akerz and A Brew\u201d a show that is sure to be a BLAST.\nCLICKABLE LINKS\nWeb - nappyroots.com\nFB - facebook.com/nappyrootsmusic\nIG - instagram.com/nappyroots\nTwitter - twitter.com/nappyroots\nYouTube - youtube.com/channel/UCBPQKfPHf6F7K6wmmkpj7BA\nPandora - pandora.com/station/play/4414875100671190503\nSpotify - open.spotify.com/artist/3tCxM1rTj2qUXsiQZxvt2I\niTunes - itunes.apple.com/us/artist/nappy-roots/885525\niHeartRadio - iheart.com/artist/nappy-roots-8758\nGoogle Play - play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/wst/artist/Aomyfjj4byxx3h6ju2juoc256vi\nOUTSIDERS SYNDICATE - (SCROLL DOWN FOR CLICKABLE LINKS)The Bay Area\u2019s Roughest Battle Squad.

Point being, it\u2019s a primal act, or what you might call a good first step. So now this PAINT: guitarist/singer Pedrum Siadatian of the Allah-Las making his first solo record with his first solo recordings of his first solo songs. It\u2019s simple: he\u2019s making a mark.\n\nHe\u2019d started four-tracking strange little song-sketches as the Allah-Las finished their third album Calico Review in 2016\u2014 little song-sketches that wouldn\u2019t fit the full band, but that indicated an outr\u00e9 sort of potential. These were slow-growing ideas fed by a certain acid-bitter poetry (Gregory Corso and John Lennon, for two) and by strands and lines unraveled from casually encountered prose or reportage. They\u2019d derive a certain blurry life and sound from the murky music of Kevin Ayers or Syd Barrett, whose cultivations were as likely to bloom into gloom as beauty. PAINT\u2019s first song was \u201cMoldy Man,\u201d grown almost in secret far from harsh light and hot air. His next was \u201cTrue Love (Is Hard To Find).\u201d With one, he could\u2019ve been done, but with two, he knew he was at the start of something.\n\nHe found a producer and partner-in-grime in adept cinematic psychedelicist Frank Maston, who instinctively understood these songs would fall apart if scrubbed too sternly in the studio. Instead, they worked gently but intently to amplify the strange and mysterious sound of Siadatian\u2019s wobbly hissy L.A. born home tapes, borrowing drummers (the Allah-Las\u2019 Matthew Correia and \u201che\u2019s-everywhere!\u201d man Nick Murray (recently spotted with White Fence and Thee Oh Sees) as well as summoning synthesizer and flute for the subtle extraterrestrial orchestration on \u201cI Didn\u2019t Know A Thing\u201d and the positively celestial \u201cHeaven In Farsi.\u201d\n\nNow PAINT has a happily paradoxical finished-but-not-finished-off feel, like Lou Reed\u2014or Doug Yule, the unfairly ignored Velvet Underground guitarist. Like R. Stevie Moore and Julian Cope and Richard Hell, but only their songs that never came out. Here\u2019s \u201cDaily Gazette\u201d: big-city-on-the-skids mid-tempo hot-summer punk blues cool like those Richard Hell/Tom Verlaine Neon Boys tapes that barely saw legit release. Here's \u201cSplattered\u201d: a subway- sound VU valentine. You can think about The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cShattered\u201d if you make sure to think about Pollock and paint, splattered, too. Hear \u201cSilver Streaks\u201d: budget-studio 1970s expression-as-obsession from the California observed and preserved by demimonde private-press psychedelicists Damon or F.J. McMahon. Here's \u201cWash\u201d: a last-dance cosmic waltz that could\u2019ve been a snippet of an Angelo Badalamenti soundtrack, though hard to say if it's for a happy ending or a sad\u2026or a \u201cTO BE CONTINUED?\u201d\n\nAnyway, this is PAINT, the substance and the action\u2014it drips, it runs, it changes colors.

It\u2019s got mistakes and also mistakes that turned out not to be mistakes, and jokes and puns that turned out to be unexpectedly resonant truths. And if it sounds like it never saw the inside of a real studio, well\u2026some artists just like to work from nature, or their inner nature. Not the desert but the dirt, not the night but the dark, not the sun but the heat and not the sea but the deep, and always the heartbeat blood- rush feel-it! momentum that makes all rock \u2018n\u2019 roll rock and roll. \u201cYou gotta just keep moving on,\u201d says PAINT. \u201cStick with it and you can\u2019t go wrong\u201d - just as the painter Piet Mondrian said to Lee Krasner \u201cYou must never lose it.\u201d Same idea!\n\nThink of it this way: PAINT\u2019s first album isn\u2019t clean, but it\u2019s very very clear.

No stranger to challenges, this four-man collective from Kentucky tackled their obstacles and, in the process, their self-honest work emerged in the form of 7 studio albums and 14 mix-tapes. As usual, Nappy Roots examine our alienable rights, reason, and truth through lyrical originality and voyage. Since Nappy Roots entered the music scene in 1998, they have remained real, humble, talented guys with inherent, undeniable southern swagger.\nAfter the international success of Watermelon, Chicken, & Grits, selling over 3 million albums, the members of Nappy Roots were flying high while still acutely aware of how far it could be to the bottom should they fall. It is that practical and genuine presence of mind that helped them sustain touring as a group these last ten years. Building a vastly loyal fan-base nationwide, fans and friends can be used interchangeably when referring to their army of followers. For most people, it is normal to only share intimate moments with friends, but for the members of Nappy, it is no different when in their living room, studio, or on stage, as they possess the gift of honesty and deliver that message with charisma. That truthfulness is especially reflected in this compilation inspired and written for this moment in time.\nAfter severing ties with Atlantic Record and going independent, Nappy Roots had no choice but to keep it moving and did so as smoothly as possible. As the saying goes, \u201cthe show must go on,\u201d and so it has, obstacles included. With a heavy heart and no major label record deal, Nappy Roots knew they had to remain in pursuit of their destiny and, thus, Nappy Roots Entertainment Group was formed. The members of Nappy Roots were facing foreclosures and a mountain of stress in the jobless economy, but still, they remained positive and pushed on, while never forgetting where they came from and what they had accomplished. With fans constantly communicating with the members online and at shows, the guys realized they weren\u2019t the only ones having trouble.\nWith the release of their tenth mix-tape \"SH!T'S BEAUTIFUL\" and the departure of Big V from the group, as he left to pursue a solo career, Nappy Roots forged forward. Between touring and recording, the four-man group focuses on consistently putting out quality hip-hop. A weak man with no vision, no diligence behind the vision, and no faith behind the diligence would have given up, but Skinny Deville, Fishscales, B. Stille and Ron Clutch did, can, and will handle this and more, all in the name of Nappy Roots. This is evident in their two-part Saga The 40 Akerz Project and Another 40 Akerz, released in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\nTo celebrate 20 years in the game, Nappy has earned yet another GOLD RECORD with \u201cGOOD DAY\u201d. That, along with 40 plus placements in movies and commercials, has given the group the continued propulsion to maintain the Nappy Lifestyle and connection to their fans. This has provided a perfect platform to transition into another passion. In 2018 Nappy celebrated opening their own NanoBrewery call ATLANTUCKY BREWING COMPANY and have already taken the craft beer world by storm garnering rave reviews for their first two public offerings. This journey of great beer and great music will be coming to a small screen near you with the release of \u201c40 Akerz and A Brew\u201d a show that is sure to be a BLAST.\nCLICKABLE LINKS\nWeb - nappyroots.com\nFB - facebook.com/nappyrootsmusic\nIG - instagram.com/nappyroots\nTwitter - twitter.com/nappyroots\nYouTube - youtube.com/channel/UCBPQKfPHf6F7K6wmmkpj7BA\nPandora - pandora.com/station/play/4414875100671190503\nSpotify - open.spotify.com/artist/3tCxM1rTj2qUXsiQZxvt2I\niTunes - itunes.apple.com/us/artist/nappy-roots/885525\niHeartRadio - iheart.com/artist/nappy-roots-8758\nGoogle Play - play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/wst/artist/Aomyfjj4byxx3h6ju2juoc256vi\nOUTSIDERS SYNDICATE - (SCROLL DOWN FOR CLICKABLE LINKS)The Bay Area\u2019s Roughest Battle Squad.

Anything more formulaic would quickly dispel the free spirit embodied in the music.\n\nPrecision is king with DSO, which position the stage plot based on the year of Grateful Dead show to be performed, adapting phrasing, voice arrangements, and even arranges specific musical equipment for the various eras of Dead music performed.

No stranger to challenges, this four-man collective from Kentucky tackled their obstacles and, in the process, their self-honest work emerged in the form of 7 studio albums and 14 mix-tapes. As usual, Nappy Roots examine our alienable rights, reason, and truth through lyrical originality and voyage. Since Nappy Roots entered the music scene in 1998, they have remained real, humble, talented guys with inherent, undeniable southern swagger.\nAfter the international success of Watermelon, Chicken, & Grits, selling over 3 million albums, the members of Nappy Roots were flying high while still acutely aware of how far it could be to the bottom should they fall. It is that practical and genuine presence of mind that helped them sustain touring as a group these last ten years. Building a vastly loyal fan-base nationwide, fans and friends can be used interchangeably when referring to their army of followers. For most people, it is normal to only share intimate moments with friends, but for the members of Nappy, it is no different when in their living room, studio, or on stage, as they possess the gift of honesty and deliver that message with charisma. That truthfulness is especially reflected in this compilation inspired and written for this moment in time.\nAfter severing ties with Atlantic Record and going independent, Nappy Roots had no choice but to keep it moving and did so as smoothly as possible. As the saying goes, \u201cthe show must go on,\u201d and so it has, obstacles included. With a heavy heart and no major label record deal, Nappy Roots knew they had to remain in pursuit of their destiny and, thus, Nappy Roots Entertainment Group was formed. The members of Nappy Roots were facing foreclosures and a mountain of stress in the jobless economy, but still, they remained positive and pushed on, while never forgetting where they came from and what they had accomplished. With fans constantly communicating with the members online and at shows, the guys realized they weren\u2019t the only ones having trouble.\nWith the release of their tenth mix-tape \"SH!T'S BEAUTIFUL\" and the departure of Big V from the group, as he left to pursue a solo career, Nappy Roots forged forward. Between touring and recording, the four-man group focuses on consistently putting out quality hip-hop. A weak man with no vision, no diligence behind the vision, and no faith behind the diligence would have given up, but Skinny Deville, Fishscales, B. Stille and Ron Clutch did, can, and will handle this and more, all in the name of Nappy Roots. This is evident in their two-part Saga The 40 Akerz Project and Another 40 Akerz, released in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\nTo celebrate 20 years in the game, Nappy has earned yet another GOLD RECORD with \u201cGOOD DAY\u201d. That, along with 40 plus placements in movies and commercials, has given the group the continued propulsion to maintain the Nappy Lifestyle and connection to their fans. This has provided a perfect platform to transition into another passion. In 2018 Nappy celebrated opening their own NanoBrewery call ATLANTUCKY BREWING COMPANY and have already taken the craft beer world by storm garnering rave reviews for their first two public offerings. This journey of great beer and great music will be coming to a small screen near you with the release of \u201c40 Akerz and A Brew\u201d a show that is sure to be a BLAST.\nCLICKABLE LINKS\nWeb - nappyroots.com\nFB - facebook.com/nappyrootsmusic\nIG - instagram.com/nappyroots\nTwitter - twitter.com/nappyroots\nYouTube - youtube.com/channel/UCBPQKfPHf6F7K6wmmkpj7BA\nPandora - pandora.com/station/play/4414875100671190503\nSpotify - open.spotify.com/artist/3tCxM1rTj2qUXsiQZxvt2I\niTunes - itunes.apple.com/us/artist/nappy-roots/885525\niHeartRadio - iheart.com/artist/nappy-roots-8758\nGoogle Play - play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/wst/artist/Aomyfjj4byxx3h6ju2juoc256vi\nOUTSIDERS SYNDICATE - (SCROLL DOWN FOR CLICKABLE LINKS)The Bay Area\u2019s Roughest Battle Squad.

Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Indubious was forged in the fires of pain and destruction. Evton and Skip, brothers and bandmates born with Cystic Fibrosis and convinced by doctors of their impending death from an early age, have emerged as a powerful force for change and the future of conscious music. Their only choice has always been mind over matter, and time has proven that their unbending positive outlook, combined with an inspiring message of love and hope, has not only helped them overcome personal hardship, but catapulted their music onto the world stage with an unstoppable momentum.\n\nCurrently based in Oregon, Indubious has released four albums over the past few years, including Wake The Lion which was produced by EDM/Dub/Reggae pioneer Gaudi. Their new album From Zero, which dropped on 7-1-17, debuted at #6 on the Billboard Reggae Chart and #8 on iTunes Reggae Chart, features legendary guest artists including Dancehall icon Sizzla, Vaughn Benjamin (formally of Midnite and Akae Beka), and Reggae/R&B singer Zahira Soul. From Zero is a mix of conscious Dancehall and Roots Reggae with top level production. All songs were written, produced, and engineered by Indubious, and released on their own label Righteous Sound Productions.\n\n\u201cSimply put, Indubious is my favorite band of 2017, and From Zero is my favorite album of 2017 - and it truly\ndeserves to be yours too.\u201d review by Russel A. Trunk via annecarlini.com\n\n\u201cFor me, that\u2019s one of the most original, refreshing pieces of reggae music i\u2019ve heard in a long time. I think it\u2019s really special.\u201d David Rodigan on BBC in regards to the song See Sharp off of From Zero.\n\nArmed with impressive instrumental skill, powerful harmonies, and an electrifying stage presence, Indubious is destined to change the face of music. They have developed a steadily rising reputation as ambassadors of the West Coast Reggae movement. Leaving audiences stunned and amazed whilst shattering any preconceived notions of genre and style, they recruit fans from all walks of life, affectionately called \"Indubians.\"\nIndubious has performed worldwide on international tours and at many prestigious festivals including Wakarusa, Gathering Of The Vibes, Reggae On The River, Sulafest in India, Sierra Nevada World Music Festival, California Roots Festival, Beloved, Britt Festivals, The Oregon Country Faire, Reggae In The Hills, Northwest World Reggae Festival, Earthdance, Gaia Festival, plus club and concert hall tours from Seattle to San Diego. They have shared the stage and toured with many influential names such as Black Uhuru, Matisyahu, Blondie, Michael Franti, Stephen Marley, Rebelution, Junior Reid, and Pato Banton, to name a few.\n\nThe widely acclaimed Indubious album Wake The Lion received featured placement on Beatport, iTunes, Amazon, and numerous media outlets. Indubious' unique sound was brought vibrantly to the surface by the legendary composer/producer Gaudi, showcasing Wake The Lion as a textural journey into the world of Rootstronica. Lush synths, deep bass, and visionary lyricism encompass the entire record, blurring the lines between roots, dub, dancehall, and heavy dance psychedelia. Vibrationally rich and musically brilliant, the album champions a revolutionary sound and pushes the boundaries of reggae music.\n\nThe band and their legion of fans have adopted the motto \u201cLive Indubiously,\u201d which means living life without doubt or fear, and with faith in the fact that we are all here for a reason. \u201cOur gift is music,\u201d says Indubious, \u201cand our mission is to reconnect the people of the world with rightful living. We wish to speak the truth in an effort to inspire others to do the same, to raise the positive vibrations of our planet, and\nto help others express the true loving nature within us all.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $15 Adv & $17 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Goose", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6182497.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "GOOSE have always managed to unite people.

Hunter, the band\u2019s only original member, switched from guitar/vocals to drums, and the band never skipped a beat. Tristan, who was at one point the band\u2019s fill in bass player, took on the key roles of guitarist and primary songwriter. The two brothers enlisted the services of bassist/vocalist Alex Kouninos, and later guitarist/vocalist Brian Gellman to round out the sound. The new band quickly developed their own style, with unique three part vocal harmony permeating their recordings, and live performances.\n\nSince the overhaul, Decent Criminal has released a 7\u201d split in 2015, a self-titled debut LP in 2016, and has most recently released their sophomore LP \"Bloom\u201d via Dodgeball Records in 2017.

Yet the common thread that runs through Craig\u2019s broad musical canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. Carl Craig has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader, guided by his tendency toward forward\n\nthinking.\n\n\n\nCraig released his first track in 1989. One of his earliest mentors and first collaborator was Derrick May, whose imprint Craig also released some of his early music on.\n\n\n\nIn 1991, wanting pure artistic freedom, Craig set up his own label Planet-E and released \u20184 Jazz Funk Classics\u2019, under the moniker 69, as the label\u2019s first release. From here his wild exploration of sound intensified\u2026\n\n\n\nA Gemini true to form, with a mind that never sits still, Craig has released a diverse range of experimental and groundbreaking music under a plethora of aliases including 69, BFC, C2, Innerzone Orchestra (\u2018Bug in the Bassbin\u2019 was credited as the spark that inspired the evolution of drum\u2018n\u2019bass), No Boundaries, Psyche, Paperclip People, Tres Demented, Urban Tribe and many more. He has also produced albums for the legendary Detroit Jazz collective Tribe as well as orchestrator / pianist Francesco Tristano and French producer Agoria.\n\n\n\nLive he has collaborated with Les si\u00e8cles orchestra at Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris. A meeting of techno and classical music, the concert was described as \u201chistorical\u201d, Craig went on to repeat the formula in Milan and Germany. He regularly performs live as experimental outfit Trio with Moritz Von Oswald and Francesco Tristano, sometimes as Narod Niki alongside Villalobos, Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Zip and others, and regularly does part live and part DJ with Luciano. Additionally he\u2019s\n\ntaken to occasionally bringing keyboardists like Mike Banks (UR), Amp Fiddler and Tristano into the DJ booth with him for special one-off gigs. He also improvised live to an Andy Warhol film at the Unsound Festival in New York. In 2011, Craig went live as 69 for the first time ever, fusing masks, darkness and the music of 69, Craig created 69\u2019s own entity and previewed the show to a few select festivals and clubs around the world.\n\n\n\nHis remixes discography boasts some of the most desirable names in music \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Junior Boys (nominated for a Grammy Award), Gavin Russom & Delia Gonzalez, Theo Parrish, Tori Amos, Can, Goldfrapp, Friendly Fires, Caribou, Tiga, Unkle, Yello and more.\n\n\n\nAs well as an outlet for his own productions, his Planet-E imprint has given a home to a wide range of Detroit-based artists including Francesco Mora Catlett, Naomi Daniel, Flexitone, Jason Hogans, Kenny Larkin, Monty Luke, Moodyman, Mike Agent X, Oliverwho Factory, Ezana Harris, Recloose, Reference, Kevin Saunderson, Big Tone, Tribe, Urban Tribe, and Chaz Vincent.\n\n\n\nStaying strong to his Detroit roots, where he still lives today, Craig helped launched the Detroit Electronic music Festival in 2000 and remains a strong force at the festival today. He has also created and launched his non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation: \u201cThe concept is to find ways to re-educate kids about what\u2019s interesting musically that you can\u2019t get on the radio\u2026 To develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of Detroit music being diverse and interesting, to spot out the most talented young musicians coming out of high school and lend small financial grants to encourage music education at a higher level.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen Craig explains his philosophy, his wry sense of humor seeps into his explanations of far-reaching concepts that merge worlds together. \u201cI have a very special career. When I feel that I\u2019m tired of going on the road I can go in the studio. When I\u2019m tired of concentrating on the studio I can go on the road. I can work with concert pianists, jazz musicians or rock guys. Very few people\n\nhave that range of interests. Very few people juggle a career that they choose specifically.\u201d No one else can pull it all together quite like Carl Craig.", "otherInfo": "Carl Craig @ Audio SF"}, {"Address": "101 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Rachel Torro", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7910620.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Deep House", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "San Francisco deep house DJ / soundcloud.com/racheltorro", "otherInfo": "~*~* The Garden Party *~*~"}, {"Address": "62 S Second St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Ismo Leikola", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617112.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.88904, 37.33618], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Pop", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "San Jose Improv", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL Two item minimum purchase required.

Crooked is known for his work horse mentality, and high energy DJ sets, but has never been one for the industry politics. While DJ Neva has earned his OG status due to his countless years of experience in the DJ game. In 2007, they brought a piece of home with them by founding KNYEW (acronym for \u201cKeeping New York Every Where), a successful clothing brand, the first of its kind to be seen in Las Vegas. Similarly, both D-Miles and Jaime Da Great grew up in the LA. Jaime, while making a huge name for himself in the sneaker industry, has shifted his focus into becoming a full time DJ. D-Miles climbed the ranks by opening for the industry\u2019s hottest DJ\u2019s and making a name for himself in the process.

Rachel\u2019s rich, nuanced vocal delivery and Thu\u2019s dynamic guitar arrangements provide the backbone for the duo\u2019s eclectic and heartfelt songs that tell emotionally honest and compelling stories.\n\nTheir identities as mixed-race-Mexican-American and first-generation-Vietnamese-American (respectively) subtly inform the inclusionary, modernist perspective of their lyrics, which provide \u201csmart commentary on social attitudes\u201d (Pasadena Weekly), while their music and melodies cut across decades of classic American song forms, bending and blending genres to produce a unique sound with a fresh, clever and distinct approach to the classic traditions of American jazz, folk and blues.\n\nAfter meeting in 2006, the California-based duo began writing and performing music together. Over the course of two years, as their songwriting developed, they began to incorporate influences from different eras of jazz and pop music, which led to the creation of their unique, vibrant, \u201csophisticated but playful\u201d sound (BuzzBands LA). \u201cHis guitar shimmies and swings like Django Reinhardt while her voice wraps around each note, swaying in unison like a modern-day Ella Fitzgerald.\u201d (Nooga).

This latest release is being praised as \u201ca delectable listen, an emotional journey down a sullen, yet hopeful trail. Garcia and Tran bring together songs that appear written just for the listener, and no one else.\u201d (Playback: STL). The songs on the EP are described as \u201cbaroque lullabies that move along with an ease and fluidity that showcases their musical maturity and sensibility.\u201d (The Deli LA) The deeply personal record highlights the duo\u2019s strengths as writers and performers: \u201cGarcia's rich, warm voice wraps around you like the softest quilt and Tran's subdued guitar shines at all the right moments, creating somber tracks that are more than palatable and necessary.\u201d (Bitch Media)\n\nIn October 2017, the duo released their third collection of songs, DIRECTIONS. The Huffington Post says the album \"radiates gorgeously contagious melodies, palpitating rhythms and luscious harmonies and, of course, Garcia\u2019s unparalleled voice.\" In February 2018, the song, \"Give Love\" was nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Song at the 16th Annual Independent Music Awards. The duo is currently touring nationally. Of their performance at the 2018 Kansas City Folk Festival, Playlist Play writes: \"The duo creates soft melodic songs, that could just as easily exist as poems. Beautiful and full of soul and emotion, the quaint pair swept the audience away; first time listeners and long-term fans.\"\n\nIn October 2019, the duo partnered with High Plains Public Radio for the HPPR Music Ambassador Tour, a multi-city listening room tour, aiming to bring high-quality live music to the small towns and rural communities in the high plains region of the US. The HPPR Ambassador program increases community exposure to the arts and, through these intimate performances, provides these audiences with access to world-class musicians.\n\nThe duo is currently writing and recording their next full-length studio album, Dreams!

Manny Alferez and Phil Collis have artfully dedicated the focus of their wizardry to a shared passion for electronic music, and Sleight of Hands beams as a beacon of fresh disco-laden house sounds that is here to stay. Neither Manny nor Phil was a stranger to the electronic music game. Manny staked his everlasting claim in the Bay Area community in 1990 as a key promoter and DJ, roles for which he took on the abbreviated appellation of M3, short for \u201cMakes Me Move\u201d. The M3 sound began as a fluid, down-tempo approach and eventually evolved to become a funk-charged expression of house and tech-bangers for which he is so well-known today. Manny quickly developed his own legendary party brand known as Green Gorilla and progressed to sharing the decks with industry icons such as Marshall Jefferson, Derrick Carter, Cajmere, Mark Farina, and Rick James. A well-deserved social buzz led M3 to notoriety which would land him bookings across the globe; this further developed Manny\u2019s acumen for rhythm and cultural finesse, which set the stage for his bond with multifaceted performing arts crackerjack, Phil Collis.

By the early age of seven, he was already heralded a child prodigy and performing classical piano music to audiences across the UK. By the age of nine Phil was inducted into the esteemed Royal Academy of Music and by the age of twelve he had already been tapped for his acting abilities starring in roles alongside Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Liam Neeson.

Like M3, Phil\u2019s earlier approach to electronic music was a silky one, and Bachelor\u2019s of Science quickly became one of the pioneers of the \u201cliquid funk\u201d genre while experimenting with a soulful approach to drum n\u2019 bass. Upon moving to San Francisco, Phil quickly became engrossed in the captivating house beats oozing from the subwoofer that was the Bay Area, instantly pointing him to Green Gorilla and M3. When each of them realized that the other was stupidly awesome, shared visions prevailed and a collaborative enterprise was born. With best-selling remixes completed for international superstars Groove Armada and Dirty Vegas, the duo has made quite an industrious mark in a very short period of time. The impact of holding multiple #1 spots on Beatport proved prosperous, landing Sleight of Hands 2013 performance slots at world-renowned festivals such as Outside Lands and Coachella. Their magical musical approach to stylistic fusion makes listeners realize that the synergetic skills of Manny and Phil are anything but bluff. Today, relentless dedication in the studio along with a solid DJ residency at world-renowned SF nightlife staple, Monarch, continues to launch Sleight of Hands toward intergalactic success.

Descended from a family of cowboys and Baptist preachers, he\u2019s part African- American, part Egyptian, part Cherokee Indian but while his heritage is all- American his global outlook, and unique way of viewing the world through the prism of contemporary music culture, transcends his Mid-Western origins.\n\nBorn in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and raised in suburban Detroit, Seth learnt the art of DJing initially from his stepfather (then a college Radio DJ) and later working behind the counter in legendary Detroit record store \u2018Melodies & Memories\u2019. It wasn\u2019t until he made the brave decision to seek new-beginnings in mid- 2000s Berlin that his DJ career really found its feet. Moving to Berlin fresh out of his teens, just as the minimal techno movement was kicking off, was the making of Seth and since then he hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nSince moving from Detroit to Berlin, and more recently London then Ibiza, ten years ago, Seth has established himself as one of underground electronic music\u2019s most iconic figures, equally at home playing to the smoke-filled dancefloors of some of the world\u2019s most discerning nightclubs, such as fabric, Nortstern, De School or Output, as he is headlining the world\u2019s largest festivals, like Glastonbury, Lowlands, Roskilde or Tomorrowlands. Right from the word go Seth has been as passionate about food and contemporary art as he is about music and these two interests have resonated at all points in parallel alongside his music career. A multi-faceted polymath: he has held residencies at talismanic music institutions such as DC10 (Ibiza), fabric (London) Trouw (Amsterdam), and Output (NYC), runs three record labels, owns a successful restaurant \u2018Smokey Tails\u2019 and is just about to unveil a new project that sits firmly at the intersection between futuristic electronica, contemporary art and technology. In 2013 he was voted number one DJ in the world in Resident Advisor\u2019s prodigious \u2018Top 100 DJs\u2019 poll. In 2016 he was member of an expedition to the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro lead by renowned Australian neurosurgeon Charlie Teo that raised over $1million for brain cancer charities.\n\n\u201cI live to work on projects and build ideas that sit at the point where art, commerce and ideas meet.

Having each quit some of the best bands in the business, both are late founding members of The Waybacks and each have performed at Strawberry in other configurations. Stevie Coyle has a long and illustrious career as an entertainer that began well before birth and Glenn Houston's well decorated history in music is best known to berry heads for his founding role of powerhouse Americana quintet, Houston Jones. As individuals, both are renowned players in music circles. Now they have joined forces, to the delight of California audiences, to become a right-handed, right-side up fingerpicking and left-handed upside down flatpicking twosome. Mostly acoustic. Some electric. Much serendipity.\u201d\n\nSTEVIE COYLE (late of the whiz-bang string band The Waybacks) is one lucky bum. His dad ran a radio station in southern California and brought home all the promo LPs that didn't fit the Spanish-language format. The Ventures' Guitar Freakout and Alvin & The Chipmunks Play The Beatles' Hits both came home on a single fateful day.\n\nIt didn't hurt, either, that string-meister David Lindley played in a bluegrass band that rehearsed right next door and gave Stevie his very first lessons, or that his dear Granny was a pianist in the heyday of vaudeville, or that his sainted mother was a whiz in mandolin orchestras of the 1930s. Not even several years of playing Folk Masses on Sundays could quash his musical spirit.\n\nAfter securing degrees in Theatre and Theology at Santa Clara University he hit the road for 3 years with The Royal Lichtenstein Circus. Once back home, he signed on as actor / stage manager for San Jose Rep. He announced killer whale shows. His best friend was an elephant.\n\nHe and pal Roy Zimmerman have worked closely in several collaborations over the years, including folk tribute / parody band The Foremen and comedy duo The Reagan Bros. The boys were regulars at The Comedy Strore and The Improv. Stevie appeared on Cheers, in many television commercials and had a recurring role on The Young And The Restless.\n\nHey, wake up!! We're almost done.\n\nSafely back in the Bay Area, he continued his acting career, doing commercials, voiceovers and films, and played in the folk duo The Frontmen. He co-founded The Waybacks in 1999 and fronted that band through 2007. They released 4 albums in that time, played major festivals like Merlefest, Grey Fox, Floydfest and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, toured Australia and collaborated with Lloyd Maines, Michelle Shocked and Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead.\n\nStevie's gone feral and solo now. He's busily booking festivals, venues and house concerts. He's also released his first solo CD, Ten-In-One, produced by guitar guru Walter Strauss\n\nGLENN HOUSTON (nee Pomianek) has been voted Best Guitarist by the Northern California Bluegrass Society, is a past judge of the National Flatpicking Guitar Championship Competition in Winfield, Kansas, and was the founding lead guitarist of the Waybacks, co-founder and long-time lead guitarist for Bammie (Bay Area Music Award) winners Hearts on Fire, and more recently co-founder and long-time lead guitarist for the powerhouse Americana quintet Houston Jones. Most recently, Glenn has teamed up with former Waybacks band mate Stevie Coyle to form the duo \u201cThe Quitters,\u201d a mostly acoustic celebration of fingerstyle and flatpick mastery. Glenn also has recently joined Susie Glaze in performances of the quintet edition of The New Folk Ensemble.\n\nOriginally from New Jersey, Glenn\u2019s guitarist influences range from Albert King and Michael Bloomfield to Doc Watson and James Burton. These influences show in his well-balanced mastery of both acoustic and electric guitar.\n\nOver the years, Glenn has shared billing with such luminaries as Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard, the Tubes, the David Grisman Quintet, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Bela Fleck, Tim O\u2019Brien, Hank Williams Jr., Steve Earle, John Hartford, Earl Scruggs, Doc and Merle Watson, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Delbert McClinton. Glenn has been the lead guitarist for country great Johnny Paycheck, and has performed and recorded with Grammy winner Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott. With his strong background in electric blues, Glenn has performed with blues legends Mark Naftalin (Paul Butterfield Blues band) and Nick Gravenites (Electric Flag) in tribute to Mark and Nick\u2019s late band mate, blues great Michael Bloomfield.\n\nGlenn\u2019s classical music background includes choral vocal performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic (Zubin Mehta conducting, Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, at Carnegie Hall and the United Nations General Assembly [the U.N.\u2019s 25th anniversary celebration]), and the Boston Symphony (Erich Leinsdorf conducting, Brahms\u2019 Requiem, at Carnegie Hall).", "otherInfo": "Tune in to KKUP 91.5 FM or https://kkup.org/listen-online Sunday, February 16th.

But behind the geography and moniker is a band of meticulous and literary songwriters matched by a specific brand of brooding, anthem-riding balladry and orchestral indie rock. Murder By Death\u2019s path began in the early 2000s as most Midwestern college-town groups do, by playing to small crowds at ratty venues and frenzied house parties. While many of their formative-year scene-mates failed to make it much further than campustown\u2019s borders, Murder By Death translated their anonymous beginnings into a 10+ year career founded on a bedrock of five full-length albums, tireless D.I.Y. touring and performing ethics, and, most importantly, a dedicated, cult-like fanbase. Since the band began in 2001, their audience has blossomed due in part to extended tours alongside similarly hardworking musical kin such as Against Me!, Gaslight Anthem, Lucero, William Elliott Whitmore, Ha Ha Tonka, and others. Through more than 1,000 performances across the United States, Canada and Europe, Murder By Death has gained word-of-mouth devotees and support from the likes of media outlets like SPIN Magazine, who said of the band, \u201cThey brawl like Johnny Cash\u2019s cellmates or dreamily swoon like Nick [Cave], stomping saloon floorboards in 4/4 time as grand strings fade into high noon.\u201d What resonates most with supporters is the band\u2019s energetic, unique, and altogether consistent sound and conceptualized vision. The personnel and ingredients of the group consist of Sarah Balliet\u2019s throaty cello melodies, singer/guitarist Adam Turla\u2019s booming baritone vocals and brawny guitar strumming, drummer Dagan Thogerson and bassist Matt Armstrong\u2019s locked-down, post-punk rhythm section interplay, and Scott Brackett\u2019s (formerly of Okkervil River and Shearwater) multi-instrumentalist bag of tricks (including piano, trumpet, accordion, mandolin, vocals, percussion). The overriding sound is an amalgamation of textures ranging from dark and desolate to upbeat and brightly melodic, all of it landing somewhere under the orchestrated indie rock umbrella. The other mainstay signature element of Murder By Death\u2019s identity has been built by the overriding concepts behind each individual album. Every successive effort conjures up fresh imaginative and tactile worlds \u2013 whether it\u2019s the battle between the Devil and a small Western town (Who Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them?, 2003), an arid land of death and redemption (In Bocca al Lupo, 2006), or just songs inspired by a retreat into the Tennessee mountains (Good Morning, Magpie, 2010). On September 25, the band releases their newest full-length and Bloodshot Record\u2019s debut Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon. The album was written throughout 2011 in a basement in southern Indiana, and recorded in winter 2011 in Dallas, TX with producer-in-demand John Congleton (Explosions in the Sky, St Vincent, Black Mountain). \"Just remember what old Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake.

Christian, Artist, Producer, Sound Engineer, Assistant Youth Pastor... Anthony Terry Jr. (A.N.T.) was saturated in the depths of the \u201chood life\u201d as a child. Born in San Bernidino and raised in the \u201cjungles\u201d of Los Angeles, Anthony witnessed first hand, the effects of poverty, violence, and drugs. Music has always been one of the most influential guiding forces in Anthony\u2019s life. Expression through music was Anthony\u2019s preferred form of communication. Hip Hop more specifically. For as long as he could remember, Anthony has always used music (Hip Hop) as a tool of relief and escape from the world\u2019s issues, like poverty, stress, and loneliness. He soon realized, music wasn\u2019t enough\u2026 Although Anthony grew up in a strong Christian based household, life\u2019s issues still pressed him hard. For most of Anthony\u2019s childhood and adolescence, he struggle with an outrageous temper that tore him away from his family. Mental institutes and group homes became his caudle sack. Enraged with wanting to free himself from his binding conditions, Anthony had no choice but to turn to Christ. Anthony began building a relationship with God at that moment and he was never the same. Anthony began writing song after song, rejoicing for the newness and brightness that he had gained from being in a fulfilling relationship with Jesus Christ. This new joy that he had found in Christ had to be shared. In 2011, Anthony created an independent record label, \u201cHe\u2019s The Man Records\u201d (now currently Rich Soil Records), under which he recorded his first studio album that he produced, engineered, and released to the public in 2012 entitled, \u201cRealationship\u201d. Many mentors and spiritual leaders saw Anthony\u2019s fervor and fire to spread the joy of Jesus and walked with him on his journey to do so. In mid-2012, Anthony produced, engineered, and released his mix tape album entitled, \u201cThe Outer Lenz\u201d. After his release of \u201cThe Outer Lenz\u201d, Anthony\u2019s fan base peaked and he started gaining recognition from the local churches and venues. Anthony later released a sequel mixtape album to \u201cOuter Lenz\u201d entitled \u201cBlind Destruction\u201d on May 21st, 2013. \u201cBlind Destruction\u201d was an immediate success with over 400 downloads in the first week of release with its number one renowned hits \u201cGucci Good\u201d and \u201cCome Get Me ft. Amanda Whitmore\u201d. Anthony continues to ministers to believers and non-believers all over his city, but his heart is especially burdened to minister to non-believers. Anthony currently resides in Sacramento, CA as an artist/producer for Rich Soil Records and an Assistant Youth Pastor at Valley Hi Covenant Church making full use of all of his gifts and talents to expand the kingdom and piecing together his latest album project, \u201cO.D.D. (Only Diving Deeper)\u201d set to be released in 2014. This is more than music to Anthony. His hope is that, with music, with outreach, and with every available tool, all people could be brought into a true relationship with God so that they may experience the same joy he found. A.N.T. is a Cali born Christian Hip Hop artist/producer for Rich Soil Records who mission has always been to share the hope and compassion of Jesus with people of this dying world.", "otherInfo": "Kandi Love, & PLUR Alliance present\nSO STOKED: FOR LOVE\nMain Room:\nJerome Isma-Ae In Search of Sunrise\nTour\nLA Riots\nAsian Trance Mafia\nAngel\nPsychic Monkey\nPinky and friends (Kandi Up)\nLounge:\nA.N.T.\nWilly Wonksta\nBig B\nD-Jace\nAbove DNA:\nHosted by: Mystic Ventures Collective\nFaerie Court:\nQueen Titania\nLord Oberon\nFae folk\nWitches\nImps\nChangelings\nDazzle Room:\nHosted by: Doesitbang?\nLucy Stoner\nNick Drexler\nPlease\nKenai\nGrlgod\nLove doesn't flee.

As the group expanded, it absorbed younger musicians from the Daptone family including bassist Nick Movshon (El Michels, Black Keys) and other musical natives and transplants from downtown Manhattan and North Brooklyn music scenes.\n\nIn 1999, Perna and Roth dropped in at an atelier / dojo belonging to Duke Amayo. They invited him to a neighborhood concert and then reached out to him later as an emergency substitute for a show. Amayo soon became a fixture in the group, first on percussion, then later on vocals, vibraphone, and keyboards and moving to center stage as the group\u2019s frontman and creating the Afro-Spot, the band\u2019s headquarters as well as the home of the first Daptone Records studio.\n\nOver the next few years, the band performed several times a month throughout NYC at the Afro-Spot, at benefits, lofts, block parties, and at their Lower Manhattan weekly residency called \u201cAfricalia\u201d with regular appearances by friends including Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and The Sugarman Three. After their second release, \u201cTalkatif\u201d (2002, Ninja Tune), the group began touring heavily throughout North America and Europe including performances at Glastonbury, Montreux Jazz Festival, Coachella, Bonnaroo, and the Newport Jazz Festival. Over the years, expanded their travels to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South America, and most recently, Hong Kong.\n\nIn the late 2000s, after nearly ten years of road touring, Antibalas was chosen by choreographer Bill T Jones, to serve as the band for the Tony-award winning Broadway musical \u201cFela.\u201d Around the same time, the band began to draw the attention of the Roots. The two groups joined with Public Enemy to perform a live version of the entire \u201cIt Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back\u201d at the 2009 Roots Picnic as well as the Red Bull Battle of the Bands, as well as numerous guest appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\n\n\nAntibalas has also served as the house band for several star-studded tribute shows at Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theater paying tribute to the music of Aretha Franklin, David Byrne, Paul Simon, and Billie Holiday, backing dozens including Allen Toussaint, Cee Lo Green, Sharon Jones, Santigold, and Angelique Kidjo.\n\nOver the years, different members have traded production and composition duties from album to album. On the new album\u2014\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d\u2014Amayo leads us through a thrilling sonic journey of kung fu meets Afrobeat, weaving together the strands of Edo and Yoruba cultural memory from Nigeria with his training and study in Chinese martial arts.\n\nRecorded in the Summer of 2018, over seventeen musicians and singers crammed into the storied Daptone House of Soul in Bushwick to record the massive body of work. With live versions and arrangements stretching up to thirty minutes, Perna, Amayo, and Roth worked tirelessly to preserve the hypnotic power of the long-form live arrangements into six concise and powerful album tracks.\n\n\u201cFu Chronicles\u201d will be the eighth studio album from Antibalas, who have been releasing music over four decades; Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1 (1999), Talkatif (2002), Who Is This America? (2004), Security (2007), Government Magic (2011), Antibalas (2012), Where the Gods are In Peace (2017), Fu Chronicles (2020)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Downtown San Jose, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Shayna Steele", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8982988.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.887095, 37.335058], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Soul Jazz, Soul-Blues", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "San Jose Jazz Winter Fest", "moreBioInfo": "One of the greatest singing sensations of our time, known from recordings with Snarky Puppy and Moby and a host of other stars, Shayna Steele takes flight on her third album, \u201cWatch Me Fly\u201d.

Singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer, 22 year old Angel is quite possibly the UK Pop and R & B industry\u2019s best kept secret. West London bred Angel began much like many do, as a gifted child, unquenchably enthusiastic and rather uniquely, as one fifth of a family singing group along with his siblings. Known as The Charles Family, the group consisted of Angel and his siblings Tahirah, Sariah, Akelle and Kassa. The group were testament to a strong genetic musical aptitude and a passionate father who managed their early careers. The Charles Family came to prominence as a result of a BBC One documentary- One Life (2004), which followed the family\u2019s musical journey. Initially signed to Warner Music, the dynamic family group soon parted ways with the label, though by that point it was apparent that Angel had developed a thirst for making music, coupled with an undeniable talent that propelled him to go solo. Young Sirach went about experimenting with his sound, and was particularly compelled to take up producing the music, he would sing. Angel recalls, \u201cI started producing from about 10 years old, I was fascinated with music and creating it from scratch so I\u2019d use anything available to me, Atari Video Music, Cubase, it was all a case of trial and error[\u2026] it was important to me to be able to create what I was going to sing over, and laying it all down: kick, snare, strings, percussion all before I sing over it means there\u2019s a lot of heart to my music\u201d. Angel drew his main influence from his father, former manager and talented musician Tendai Charles, a professional keyboardist who accompanied an array of Reggae music talents including Bob Marley and Dennis Brown. \u201cMy dad was and still is my biggest inspiration\u201d Angel asserts, \u201cfrom a young age I saw him fulfilling his passion and the prospect of doing music everyday for the rest of my life didn\u2019t seem out of my reach.\u201d Taking it upon himself to study music in his own time, Angel took to listening to Donny Hathaway, from whose music he picked up lessons in song writing, R & B singer Brandy Norwood, whose vocal arrangements and delivery Angel would revel in, plus the record production expertise of maestros Quincey Jones and Rodney Jerkins. The study, alongside his natural gifts paid off, as Angel at just 22 now boasts the ability to write, compose and produce his songs from scratch. A talent that was identified by Universal Music who in late 2009 signed Angel to Universal Publishing as a songwriter. Angels\u2019 knack with words has seen him pen songs used by UK urban acts such as Roll Deep and Devlin, as well as him composing pop pieces for the likes of JLS and Cheryl Cole. When conceptualising his own songs, Angel draws heavily from his own experiences. Not content with making fickle music, for a throwaway culture, Angel\u2019s strength lies within his ability to make music that resonates with people\u2019s lives. \u201cI\u2019m quite the story teller\u201d he states, and nothing is more demonstrative of this perhaps than Angel\u2019s lead single off his forthcoming debut mixtape \u2018Patience Is A Virtue\u2019. This aforementioned track is Julie, an infectious, electronic driven club track, which tells the story of a relationship gone sour. Having been penned and produced entirely by Angel, he feels it\u2019s the perfect introduction to who he is as an artist.

The first mixtape is to be followed by a second, entitled \u20187 Minutes Before Time\u2019 followed by Angel\u2019s eagerly anticipated debut album \u2018About Time\u2019. For Angel, his music is cathartic, and though he makes no claims to being a squeaky clean Pop Prince (which is underlined by the tinge of irony in his name, Angel) he aims to inspire, as Angel fondly recalls, \u201cThe nicest things anybody said about my music was that they put it on when the have a headache or feeling stressed and it always soothes the headache away, for me that\u2019s a big deal the idea of music healing pain, it can\u2019t get much better than that.\u201d www.thisisangel.com www.twitter.com/thisisangel www.youtube.com/thisisangelvevo", "otherInfo": "Kandi Love, & PLUR Alliance present\nSO STOKED: FOR LOVE\nMain Room:\nJerome Isma-Ae In Search of Sunrise\nTour\nLA Riots\nAsian Trance Mafia\nAngel\nPsychic Monkey\nPinky and friends (Kandi Up)\nLounge:\nA.N.T.\nWilly Wonksta\nBig B\nD-Jace\nAbove DNA:\nHosted by: Mystic Ventures Collective\nFaerie Court:\nQueen Titania\nLord Oberon\nFae folk\nWitches\nImps\nChangelings\nDazzle Room:\nHosted by: Doesitbang?\nLucy Stoner\nNick Drexler\nPlease\nKenai\nGrlgod\nLove doesn't flee.

For Angel, his music is cathartic, and though he makes no claims to being a squeaky clean Pop Prince (which is underlined by the tinge of irony in his name, Angel) he aims to inspire, as Angel fondly recalls, \u201cThe nicest things anybody said about my music was that they put it on when the have a headache or feeling stressed and it always soothes the headache away, for me that\u2019s a big deal the idea of music healing pain, it can\u2019t get much better than that.\u201d www.thisisangel.com www.twitter.com/thisisangel www.youtube.com/thisisangelvevo", "otherInfo": "Kandi Love, & PLUR Alliance present\nSO STOKED: FOR LOVE\nMain Room:\nJerome Isma-Ae In Search of Sunrise\nTour\nLA Riots\nAsian Trance Mafia\nAngel\nPsychic Monkey\nPinky and friends (Kandi Up)\nLounge:\nA.N.T.\nWilly Wonksta\nBig B\nD-Jace\nAbove DNA:\nHosted by: Mystic Ventures Collective\nFaerie Court:\nQueen Titania\nLord Oberon\nFae folk\nWitches\nImps\nChangelings\nDazzle Room:\nHosted by: Doesitbang?\nLucy Stoner\nNick Drexler\nPlease\nKenai\nGrlgod\nLove doesn't flee.

Carlos Xavier is his name and singing is his game!\n\nCarlos engages his audience with his pure, passionate vocals. Backed by his band and his years of musical experience Carlos is able rise up and shine. His music has taken his groups all over the world.

Carlos has toured throughout the United States as well as Canada.

I made an album to make you dance, laugh, sing, cry and simply to enjoy listening to. A must for DJ\u2019s and salsa music lovers.\n\nWhen I fell in love with salsa, about 22 years ago, it became my dream to make a salsa album. Especially using the musicians and producers that made the style of salsa that I loved. I never believed it would happen but it did. With this album I plan to bring that style of salsa back that I heard many years ago and make it relevant to today, all while making it my own.\n\nI grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a melting pot of cultures so I had many genres of music in my ear. My song writing style shows that and I\u2019m very proud of it. A first generation born American to parents born in Nicaragua, my Latin roots will always be who I am, and I feel fortunate to have grown up in an era where many styles of urban music were being brought to life.

It had been over twenty years since the singer-songwriter had graduated from Montgomery Blair High School, yet his adolescent dreams, hopes, fears, anxieties and emotions the singer faced as a kid began flooding back; suddenly, the singer felt transported back into his teenage self. Growing up in suburban Maryland, Hutchinson\u2019s teenage years were filled with the type of alienation and private angst recognizable to most anyone who\u2019s ever been 16. Twenty-plus years later, the singer was finally ready to write about it.\n\nThe result: Class of 98, a 90\u2019s alt-rock-inspired autobiographical record that chronicles the singer-songwriter\u2019s adolescence.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to understand myself,\u201d Hutchinson says. \u201cWriting this record allowed me to get into the time machine and go back and look around my old life and report from my current point of view. That was fun. The problems were waiting for me: Who likes me? Why doesn\u2019t this person want to be around me? Why don\u2019t I understand myself?\u201d\n\nAfter experimenting with a series of genres like Americana/soul and jazz on his last few albums Modern Happiness and Before and After Life, the singer-songwriter turned to the pop-punk alt-rock of his youth for the riff-heavy Class of 98, taking inspiration from bands like Green Day, Oasis, and Weezer. \u201cThat music is in my guitar DNA,\u201d says the singer. \u201cI love 90\u2019s music, and this type of sound was so formative for me.\u201d To help round out his sound, Hutchinson recruited Justin Sharbono (formerly of Soul Asylum) to offer his distinctive (and period appropriate) guitar playing on the album. Hutchinson also enlisted the sonic guidance and mixing talents of Paul Kolderie, who\u2019d made great 90\u2019s records with bands like Radiohead, Hole, The Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom and The Pixies.\n\nFor Hutchinson, taking such an imaginative leap with a concept as specifically personal of Class of 98 was an artistic risk he knew he needed to take. \u201cI don\u2019t think people want me to keep making the same record, as much as anyone might think they do,\u201d he says.\n\nThe opening track \u201cRock Out Tonight\u201d sets the scene with a narrative that evokes the high-drama restlessness of a group of teenagers aimlessly driving around the suburbs in a Ford Taurus. The song, says the singer, is about \u201cwanting to be rebellious, but having no idea how to do so.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, cinematic songs like \u201cDrunk at Lunch\u201d and \u201cCooler Than You\u201d show a darker underbelly of Hutchinson\u2019s high-school introversion, echoing a theme that the singer-songwriter has been tackling in his work ever since releasing his chart-topping debut LP Sounds Like This, in 2007. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in asking questions in my songs: who\u2019s cool, who gets to decide, and where do I fit into all of that?\u201d he says.\n\nBut the emotional centerpiece of Hutchinson\u2019s latest, and the song that was the most difficult to write, is \u201cMy Old Man,\u201d written in the wake of his father\u2019s passing, after years of living with Myotonic dystrophy. More than anything else on the album, the deeply personal song gets at the album\u2019s central tension of writing from the teenage perspective while simultaneously embodying the adult point of view.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily get along with my dad in high school,\u201d says the singer. \u201cWe were in different places in our lives and he had different things to worry about. I tried to sing this song from my perspective back then as well as my perspective now, where I\u2019ve made peace with him.\u201d\n\nTaken as a whole, Class of 98 arrives as Hutchinson\u2019s most playful yet distinctive work, one that will surely resonate with longtime fans of the singer\u2019s pop-rock hits like \u201cRock & Roll,\u201d \u201cTell the World,\u201d and \u201cWatching You Watch Him.\u201d For Hutchinson, the experience of delving back into his high school youth helped him learn a lot: about his upbringing, about parenthood, and about himself.\n\n\u201cI like the 90\u2019s way better,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I\u2019m not living in them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1030 Main St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Native Elements", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6273896.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Roots, Lovers Rock, Reggae, Island Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "JaM Cellars Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "San Francisco powerhouse, Native Elements has been keeping the energetic, feel-good reggae tradition alive in the Bay Area for over 18 years.

Not necessarily his memories, though they creep in often, too. Rather, he mulls over the idea of memory itself: its resilience, its haziness, how it slips away as we try to hang on, the way it resurfaces despite our best efforts to forget.\n\nMemory is the common thread running throughout the Columbus folk-punk band's fourth album, Pillar of Na, arriving in August 31st via ANTI- Records. Following 2015's critically lauded Such Things, the new album's name is rooted in remembrance, referencing the Genesis story of Lot's wife who looks back at a burning Sodom after God instructs her not to. She looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. \"Na,\" meanwhile, is the chemical symbol for sodium. \"Nah\" is a passive refusal and the universal song word. It means nothing and stands for nothing. It is \"as it is.\"\n\nLike Lot's wife, Little cannot help but revisit where-and how-he grew up. Raised in church in southeastern Appalachian Ohio, he took up preaching when he was still a teenager, sometimes in small country settings and other times to congregations of thousands. But these days he's more interested in listening. And questioning.\n\nMusically, Pillar of Na is Saintseneca's most ambitious album to date, with Little aiming to incorporate genre elements he'd rarely heard in folk. \"I wanted to use the idiom of folk-rock, or whatever you want to call it, and to try to do something that had never been done before,\" Little explains. \"To reach way back, echoing ancient folk melodies, tie that into punk rock, and then push it into the future. I told Mike Mogis I wanted Violent Femmes meets the new Blade Runner soundtrack.

Like most successful artists, he comes from humble beginnings. Raised in the farming community of Prickly Pole, just a few miles from the home where Bob Marley grew in Nine Mile, he spent most of his childhood farming alongside his father and four siblings. As a young child he played music on handmade instruments crafted together from bamboo and sardine tins, only getting the chance to try out proper instruments in church when someone with a real guitar would finally set it down. Realizing her brother\u2019s love for music, his sister with combined efforts from their mother, saved her money to buy him his first guitar. For high school he moved from the country to St. Ann\u2019s Bay, where he lived on the same street as Burning Spear, and enlisted in the Ocho Rios High School band. They came second in the All Schools Competition in Kingston, giving him the confidence to move to the city to pursue music.\nIt was his move to Kingston in 1992 that began his musical career. Rarely seen without carrying his guitar, he was given the nickname Danny Gitz. Along with the name, his skill and reputation as an outstanding guitarist began to grow. During the early nineties the legendary Sugar Minott took him under his wing where he eventually became Sugar\u2019s band leader. I-taweh attributes Sugar to making him the musician he is today- \u201cSugar was like a father to me. He was the roughest, but at the same time the kindest, sweetest person. On stage he would let you know in front of thousands of people if you were messing up, but at the same time when you had it he always let us know too and made you feel good. He had a real sense of pride in his music and he was the first real reggae star who as a youth made we feel we were good enough. No matter how good you are, if you don\u2019t get the chance to show it \u2013 what can you do? He was one of the first people who made me believe in myself as a serious musician.\u201d\nIn 1994 he became part of the band High Symbol and after a tour landed in Australia with them. It was in in Australia that I-taweh began singing lead vocals here and there, and gaining some confidence as a front man. In 1998 I-taweh became the youngest member of Count Ossie\u2019s original Nyabhingi group, Mystic Revelation of Rastafari. Until 2007 he extensively toured Europe with the group where they are well known for their traditional Jamaican folk music and workshops which they held at Universities. In France, he began collaboration with reggae group Broussai which led to studio sessions in hotel rooms and the beginnings of tracks that he later used on his first album Overload.\nNot only was I-taweh in demand for live performances, his incredible versatility and precision on guitar and bass kept him in high demand in the studio as well. During the 90\u2019s he recorded with artists such as: Sade, Capleton, Morgan Heritage, Sugar Minott, Luciano, Lenky Roy, and Iqulah.\nIt was with Everton Blender, as the guitarist for the Blend Dem Band, that he came to the U.S. during 2004. After the tour, he went on to be the bassist for the Yellow Wall Dub Squad, a major backing band for Jamaican artists in the U.S. Billed as Itawe and often referred to as the Reggae Lion, he quickly gained popularity as the singing bassist opening for artists such as Sister Carol, Prezident Brown, the Abyssinians, Yami Bolo, Half Pint, the Mighty Diamonds, and the Melodians.\nIn 2009, after 17 years of being a supporting musician, I-taweh took a hiatus from the road and began to pursue his solo album. In 2011 he released his independently composed, written, and produced first album named Overload under his own label Tap Nat MuziK. In December 2011 I-taweh performed songs from his debut release at his launch party at Wickie Wackie in Bull Bay, Jamaica, as part of a great journey through Jamaica's radio and media landscape. I-taweh formed the band the Reggae Lions for the launch event enlisting veterans Nambo Robinson on trombone along with Everton Gayle on saxophone and Time aka Count Ossie Jr. on percussion. Selections from the Overload album and the Overload single have received significant airplay on numerous stations in Jamaica and both have become a 2011-2012 hit, reaching #1 on the Hot 102 FM chart. In the U.S., the Overload album has been very well-received at traditional reggae radio, college and syndicated programs and was selected to be part of the Direct TV cable network's menu of reggae material where several songs are in regular rotation. There has been considerable attention at radio and TV for Overload and the song has become popular with people of all ages.\nWith his all-star band, the Reggae Lions, he is currently touring and captivating audiences all over the world with his moving lyrics, confident stage presence, and phenomenal talent. I-taweh\u2019s unique and original sound comes from his Jamaican roots influence combined with inspirations from his travels abroad. His music is diverse and reflects his passion for Human Rights and Social Justice. Whether performing acoustic guitar with a stand- up bass, or with his full ten piece band, he is quickly winning the hearts of his listeners everywhere and continuously leaves his audience wanting more!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2500 Embarcadero, Oakland, CA 94606", "Artist": "Los Nuevos Cadetes", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.23782, 37.77517], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Just Dance Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2500 Embarcadero, Oakland, CA 94606", "Artist": "Grupo Bahia", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.23782, 37.77517], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Just Dance Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Rotciv", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Boom Boom Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Return of the Cypher - Freee Live Hip Hop Party"}, {"Address": "1419 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Bohemian Knuckle Boogie", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433317, 37.782618], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Sheba Piano Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Bohemian Knuckleboogie at Sheba Piano Lounge: Don't let the hokey exterior fool you, this place offers a comfortable, even classy setting in the heart of the Fillmore.

Sounds pretty unpromising don't it? Especially in an era in Hop-Hop where your success is determined off of who you know instead of what your talent can actually offer. It could at times seem impossible, I mean..where would you start? Most people would lose confidence, fold under pressure, be easily misguided or simply give up. Not in this case.\n\nBorn Shaunrick Sims on March 3 in the central valley of California, Hip-Hop Artist/Song Writer/Producer/Actor/ Priceless Da ROC (or simply known as Priceless) moved back and forth between Jamaica Queens, NY and Lompoc, CA until his stepfather received military orders to move to Washington, DC. Moving from state to state introduced Priceless to new cultures, lifestyles, different genres of music and also forced him to meet new people and make new friends, which ultimately helped his communication skills.\n\nImmediately after graduating from High School, Priceless moved back to California in hope of starting a rap career in Los Angeles. After only a year of being there, Priceless got wrapped up in gang activity, drugs, women, robberies and eventually was homeless. Dropping to under 100 pounds, sleeping outside, bouncing from trap house to trap house in hope of finding a place to stay for the night, Priceless realizing this wasn't the path he wanted to take his life, flew back to Washington DC.\n\nAfter a year of working, getting his act together, learning how to mix, master and produce his own music, Priceless figured it was time to give California another shot, this time to San Francisco. Within his first 3 years of moving to SF, Priceless was featured on MTV2, was apart of the bay area's popular underground \"Team Backpack Cyphers\", produced for Def Jam Recording artist Juelz Santana (Track Tittle \"King Of New York\") was the first artist from San Francisco to become the Freestyle Friday Champion on BET's 106&Park, was announced on the top 10 \"Bay Area Freshmen Of The Year\" list in 2012 as well as helping land the #1 record of the year spot on 106.1 Kmel in San Francisco for top 100 songs on 2012 in the bay area (Slow Down, With Clyde Carson) and most notably.. Creating the popular J12 dance and Gas Paddle wich then spiraled into the new style of dancing & culture in the bay area known as \"Gettin Saucy\",\n\nWith millions of views on YouTube, throwing the wildest parties in the bay area (which are known to reach capacity), Priceless Da ROC is not only showing he is diverse by making hit club songs, R&B tracks, spitting high energy punchlines in battles/cyphers around the world, he's also showing that with hard work and determination anything is possible. Now, representing for the bay area as one of the brightest up-and coming stars, Priceless is showing that he has no signs of slowing down and that its safe to say..this time.. he's here to stay.", "otherInfo": "\"THE BAY VS LA \" BIGGEST COLLEGE PARTY OF THE YEAR!"}, {"Address": "5104 Hopyard Rd, Pleasanton, CA 94588", "Artist": "The SOULKorean Comedian", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9117674.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.905155, 37.698093], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Spoken, karoake, ted talk", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Tommy T's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Eric Shun The SOUL Korean Comedian tells his story as a Stand-Up Comedian.
