The result is the most wide-ranging musical effort of his career, a set of songs that examines issues of mortality, survival, connection, and celebration in ways that are both deeply personal and profoundly universal.\n\nIn 2007, the singer-songwriter began working with the Musicians on Call program, playing music bedside for hospital patients. He went on to play at VA hospitals, for the Wounded Warriors organization, and for the Melodic Caring Project, singing via video for children who are quarantined, too ill to have friends or family visit in their rooms.\n\n\u201cEverything about the connection of music hit me harder,\u201d he says of these efforts, \u201cand I thought, \u2018How can I be helpful, and reach out in a more real way?\u2019 Songs have become a bridge, a way for me to reach outside myself and into other people\u2019s lives. My mission now is to connect with people, to still have fun, but to have my intention be more outwardly based, and from a place of giving and service.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Lee suffered a difficult loss of his own. \u201cMy grandmother, who was the matriarch of our very large family, and the love centerpiece in all of our gathering, got really sick, and very suddenly passed away,\u201d he says. \u201cShe showed love in the small ways\u2014in how she smiled at you when you walked in her front door, how she made a piece of buttered toast a delicacy, how she spoke with such warmth and familiarity to her mailman. In all deeds, she was graceful and beautiful and kind. So her falling ill so quickly and violently hit us all hard.\n\n\u201cAt one point during her last night,\u201d he continues, \u201cit was just her and me in the room. The rest of the family left, because the doctor told my mother and me that they thought she was stable, but then something went wrong, and she started to fade very quickly. It was around 4:30 in the morning, she was fighting for breath, sweating, and fighting for her life. I stood with her, and held her hand, hoping that she could hear me. I felt totally helpless, and while I wiped away the sweat from her forehead, and words all felt worthless, I started to sing to her. I sang \u2018Somewhere Over the Rainbow\u2019 \u2018What a Wonderful World,\u2019 and my grandfather\u2019s favorite song, \u2018Born to Lose.\u2019 She looked up at me and smiled a faint smile before she drifted into her final sleep. A couple of the overnight nurses were standing in the doorway, and in a very tragic moment, we all shared a breath. It\u2019s in these moments that I realize how sacred music is, and how the world, which seems in such disarray, can find simple solace and connection in the light of song.\u201d\n\nThis incident informs much of MY NEW MOON; Lee points particularly to the tracks \u201cAll You Got is a Song\u201d and \u201cHang On, Hang On.\u201d But, he points out, the album is as much about other people\u2019s stories as it is his own. \u201cAll this work in the last decade comes to the fore,\u201d he says. \u201cI know many people who have experienced tragedy, and whether it be a friend, or a friend\u2019s child, or a fan I meet at a coffee shop who shares their story with me, I take them all to heart. I want to connect, and to be open to those who have hardship, so that that they know I hear their stories in the same way that they hear mine, and that we\u2019re in this together. I don\u2019t want to overwhelm the listener with sorrow, but I am inspired by these friends and families, and want to help their light find shape.\u201d\n\nMuch of Lee\u2019s recent work bore the stamp of strong producers\u2014Joey Burns of Calexico on 2011\u2019s Mission Bell (which debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, Amazon, and iTunes charts, and spun off a hit single with \"Windows are Rolled Down\") and Jay Joyce (Little Big Town, Eric Church, Cage the Elephant) on 2013\u2019s Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song. But for his last album, 2016\u2019s Spirit, Lee took over the helm.\n\n\u201cProducing my last album was cool, and I\u2019m very grateful for the opportunity,\u201d he says, \u201cbut after I did it, I realized that I had a lot to learn, and that I wanted to focus my energy on my performances, and on the songwriting. For this album, I wanted to open up, and push myself to collaborate with someone who was passionate and creative and could really partner with me to elevate the album from a sonic and musical standpoint.\u201d\n\nFor the new album, Lee turned to producer Tony Berg, who has worked with everyone from Public Image Ltd to Peter Gabriel, and moved operations to Berg\u2019s Zeitgeist Studio in Los Angeles. Such notable musicians as keyboardist Benmont Tench; drummers Matt Chamberlain and Chris Dave; and multi-instrumentalists Blake Mills, Ethan Gruska, and Jaron Olevsky all participated in the sessions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to grow as a musician, and to put myself around people who are better than me,\u201d says Lee. \u201cI really don\u2019t speak the technical or theory-based language of music, and there are times in the rendering of an arrangement that those skills are extremely vital. Tony was great at that. He has a very unique and progressive interest in harmony, and a childlike wonder and energy coupled with a lifetime of experience. He\u2019s a big-hearted man, and he really helped me explore realms that I didn\u2019t quite know how to reach. His ideology is, \u2018Let\u2019s go further left than we want and see what happens.\u2019 \u201c\n\nLee came in with fifty songs to consider, but knew that there were a few that were key to the project. \u201cA lot of this starts with the song \u2018Little Light,\u2019 which is the story of a family I grew close with whose daughter had very serious cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful kid who was suffering a lot, and sometimes she and her dad would FaceTime me from her hospital room, while she was going through chemo, and I would sing to her. I wanted to write her something with hope, and to remind her that she was awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Fade Away\u201d was written for a friend whose child passed (\u201cI was trying to embody something he may have felt, or maybe how I might have felt in that situation\u201d), while \u201cWhiskey on Ice\u201d was inspired by the unexpected death of another friend. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to his mother,\u201d says Lee, \u201ctrying to walk down the hallway with her in the middle of the night and feel what she feels.\u201d\n\nMuch of the material on MY NEW MOON was altered dramatically during the recording process. \u201cWe broke these songs apart and put them back together,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThe first track\u2014\u2018No More Darkness, No More Light\u2019\u2014was originally titled differently, and had none of these same lyrics. We put in one musical element, then rebuilt the whole idea around that, then scrapped that and worked on the layers that we had created. Then I rewrote the song with a lyric more appropriate for where the song was now musically. It was frustrating and teeth-gnashing, but I\u2019m up for the challenge. I learned a lot and grew a lot, but it took a lot of slow-motion movement to ease into it.\u201d (Lee notes that \u201cHang On, Hang On\u201d is the album\u2019s only song that is acoustic guitar-based; \u201cfor everything else, there was a better idea.\u201d)\n\nThis sense of digging deeper, of fearlessly bringing out the real essence of a song\u2019s meaning, lies at the very heart of MY NEW MOON. \u201cIn these days of political crisis, I do think there\u2019s also this feeling that there could be renewal,\u201d says Amos Lee. \u201cThat\u2019s what the title of the record is about\u2014a seemingly utter darkness that\u2019s also a beginning. I know that the times I\u2019ve grown the most have been in times of crisis, when I wasn\u2019t sure who I was.\n\n\u201cIn listening, and trying to connect to someone else\u2019s pain or someone else\u2019s victories, there\u2019s a lot of fertile ground to be found. Just a beginning, a simple place to start. A conversation, a song, to see and feel someone else\u2019s humanity in your own. That\u2019s always been my interest; sometimes I get there and often I don\u2019t, but I hope in these songs, someone finds a place to start.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Goo Goo Dolls LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9419646.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Alternative, Hot Ac, Pop, Rock", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We're hitting the road this summer with special guests Lifehouse and Forest Blakk!

At age 12 she was appearing on Knoxville TV, and at 13, she was recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. When she graduated from high school in 1964 she moved to Nashville, taking many traditional elements of folklore and popular music from East Tennessee with her.\n\nParton's initial success came as a songwriter, with her songs being covered by Kitty Wells, Hank Williams, Jr., Skeeter Davis, and a number of others. She signed with Monument Records in late 1965, where she was initially pitched as a bubblegum pop singer, earning only one national chart single, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,\" which did not crack the Billboard Top 100. Additional pop singles also failed to chart.\n\nThe label agreed to have Parton sing country music after her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\" as recorded by Bill Phillips (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony) went to No. 6 on the country charts in 1966. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but didn't write), reached No. 24 country 1967, followed later the same year with \"Something Fishy,\" which went to No. 17. The two songs anchored her first full-length album, Hello I'm Dolly, that same year.\n\nIn 1967, Parton was asked to join the weekly syndicated country music TV program hosted by Porter Wagoner, replacing Norma Jean. She also signed with RCA Records, Wagoner's label, during this period, where she would remain for the next two decades. Wagoner and Parton immediately began a hugely successful career as a vocal duet in addition to their solo work and their first single together, a cover of Tom Paxton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind,\" reached the top ten on the U.S. country charts in late 1967, and was the first of over a dozen duet singles to chart for them during the next several years.\n\nParton is a hugely successful songwriter, having begun by writing country songs with strong elements of folk music in them based upon her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings. Her songs \"Coat of Many Colors\" and \"Jolene\" have become classics in the field, as have a number of others. As a composer, she is also regarded as one of country music's most gifted storytellers, with many of her narrative songs based on persons and events from her childhood.\n\nIn 1987, Parton left her longtime label, RCA, and signed with Columbia Records, where her recording career continued to prosper, but by the mid 1990s, Parton, along with many other performers of her generation, found that her new music was not welcome on country radio playlists. She recorded a series of critically acclaimed bluegrass albums, beginning with \"The Grass is Blue\" (1999) and \"Little Sparrow\" (2001), both of which won Grammy Awards. Her 2002 album \"Halos and Horns\" included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin classic Stairway to Heaven. In 2005, Parton released Those Were The Days, her interpretation of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s through early 1970s. The CD featured such classics as John Lennon's \"Imagine,\" Cat Stevens' \"Where Do The Children Play,\" Tommy James' \"Crimson & Clover,\" and the folk classic \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\", as well as the title track.\n\nIn 2007, Dolly paved new musical ground by forming her own record label, Dolly Records. The label's first release - Backwoods Barbie - debuted at #2 on the Billboard country albums charts and marks Parton's first mainstream country album in 17 years. Parton is touring North America and Europe throughout 2008 in support of her latest release.", "otherInfo": "\u201cGoodnight With Dolly\u201d will feature Dolly Parton reading a series of Imagination Library books"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Motel Black LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8990010.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Alternative, Rock, Stoner Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Motel Black is a rock band based in Boston, MA.", "otherInfo": "Motel Black brings a special virtual full-band performance to ONCE Virtual Venue, featuring a different spin on their sound plus the live debut of some new material.\n--\nRSVP free at https://www.oncesomerville.com/e/motel-black-x-once-vv-104686917388\n--\nIn May of 2020 ONCE Somerville, an independent venue in the Boston Metro area, decided to launch a \u201cvirtual venue\u201d.

Instead of simply recording himself with a guitar, he opted to bring in some instrumental help to give his musical ideas more depth. Dave found assistance in drummer Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore, who were both accomplished jazz musicians in the local Charlottesville music scene. Based on the recommendation of distinguished local jazz guru John D\u2019earth, 16-year-old musical prodigy Stefan Lessard came on board to play bass. Completing the band was keyboard player Peter Griesar, who left the band after a couple of years, as well as the talented and classically trained violinist, Boyd Tinsley.\n\nThe first public performance of Dave Matthews Band occurred at the City of Charlottesville\u2019s Earth Day Festival in April 1991. The first official gig for the newly conceived Dave Matthews Band was May 11, 1991, at a private party held on the rooftop of the pink warehouse on South Street in downtown Charlottesville. Local weekly gigs soon followed at Eastern Standard and then Trax nightclub, and within a little time, word of the band\u2019s contagious new sound spread like wildfire throughout the region. Clubs started to fill up, tours began to cover more territory, and the fan base grew at an incredible rate.\n\nOn November 9, 1993, DMB released its first album, Remember Two Things, on its Bama Rags label. The album was recorded live at The Muse Music Club on Nantucket Island, in August of 1993. The album debuted on College charts as the highest independent entry, and went on to be certified gold by the RIAA -- a significant accomplishment for an independent album. Meanwhile, the band kept touring and its fan base continued to grow. By allowing fans to tape shows for their personal use, DMB created a highly interactive community that continues in spirit today.\n\nDuring the first part of 1994, Dave Matthews Band recorded its RCA debut, Under The Table and Dreaming. Just before the album\u2019s release on September 27, 1994, Dave Matthews Band hit the road for their first official national tour. The tour lasted well over a year and included sold out theater dates across the country, a trip to Europe, and two summers playing on the main stage of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. By the fall of 1995, when the band returned to the studio to record its next album, Under The Table and Dreaming had been certified four times platinum by the RIAA.\n\nCrash, Dave Matthews Band\u2019s second RCA studio album, was released on April 30, 1996, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The band continued with a steady schedule of touring throughout 1997, headlining sold-out amphitheater dates across North America. DMB, though elevated to the level of national pop stardom, continued to do things precisely as it had from day one: organically, with a grass roots mentality.\n\nOn October 28, 1997, Bama Rags/RCA label released an official double-disc live Dave Matthews Band album, entitled Live at Red Rocks 8-15-95. Without any marketing or promotion, Live at Red Rocks debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart and was instantly certified platinum. The album provided fans with a high quality and reasonably priced alternative to the over-priced, ill produced, and illegal live DMB CDs that were beginning to flood the bootleg black-market. The overwhelming success of Live at Red Rocks, combined with the band\u2019s tremendous touring achievements, proved that Dave Matthews Band had grown from a grass roots phenomenon to one of the hottest bands in America.\n\nOn April 28, 1998, RCA released Dave Matthews Band\u2019s third studio album, Before These Crowded Streets. The critically acclaimed recording debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart; it was the band\u2019s strongest debut to date. DMB spent the following year and a half on the road, selling out stadiums, arenas, and amphitheaters across the country.\n\nOn January 19, 1999, Bama Rags/RCA released Live at Luther College: An Acoustic Performance by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. Tim Reynolds was a guest guitarist on all of the Dave Matthews Band albums, and toured with the band as a guest musician. Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds toured as an acoustic duo during the winters of \u201996, \u201997, and \u201999. The second in a series of live Dave Matthews Band-related releases, Live at Luther College debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and has since been certified platinum by the RIAA . As with Live at Red Rocks, the success of this second live album was based solely on word-of-mouth buzz.\n\nThe third installment in the ongoing live album series, Listener Supported, was released by Bama Rags/RCA on November 23, 1999. The album was recorded live at New Jersey's Continental Airlines Arena in September 1999, and a video of the performance, also titled \"Listener Supported\", was released at the same time. The double-disc album was quickly certified double platinum, and the video has sold over a million copies as well.\n\nThe band spent much of 2000 on tour, finishing as the top-grossing touring band in the U.S. In the fall, Dave Matthews joined legendary producer Glen Ballard in Los Angeles to fine-tune song arrangements for a new album, and the pair wound up co-writing 12 new songs in a matter of days. From this explosion of creative chemistry came the band's fourth studio album, Everyday, released February 27, 2001. Matthews played electric guitar for the first time, and Ballard helped the band focus and tighten their arrangements, resulting in the phenomenal success of Everyday, which has since gone triple platinum.\n\nDMB spent the summer of 2001 touring the country and exposing sold-out audiences to songs from Everyday. On August 21, \"Dave Matthews Band, The Videos 1994-2001\", was released on DVD and VHS. For the first time, the entire collection of Dave Matthews Band videos (the first 12) was presented together, along with director commentary and behind the scenes footage.\n\nOn October 23, 2001, the band released its fourth live release, Live In Chicago, 12.19.98, featuring guest musicians such as Victor Wooten, Maceo Parker, and a full set with Tim Reynolds.\n\nThe band regrouped in January 2002 at the familiar Plant Studios in Sausalito, CA where they had recorded their 3rd RCA release Before These Crowded Streets. The band revisited tracks they had previously written and recorded in 2000 and collaborated on a couple of new tunes that had debuted in recent months. The resultant creation, Busted Stuff, was made available July 16, 2002. Busted Stuff is a landmark record for DMB; for the first time ever, this album is without any musical guests. Included on the album are road-tested fan favorites such as \u201cBartender\u201d, \u201cGrey Street\u201d, \u201cWhere Are You Going\u201d, and \"Grace Is Gone\".\n\nFollowing a successful tour throughout the US in Summer 2002, Dave Matthews Band released Live At Folsom Field, Boulder CO, the band's 5th live release overall. This double CD / DVD / VHS from the band's 7/11/01 performance, contains first ever live versions of songs from Everyday and Busted Stuff, such as \"When The World Ends,\" \"So Right,\" \"What You Are,\" \"If I Had It All,\" \"Angel,\" \"The Space Between,\" \"Everyday\" \"Big Eyed Fish,\" \"Digging A Ditch,\" and \"Bartender.\" The DVD utilizes footage taken from 22 cameras, was recorded in 5.1 surround sound, and presents the finest audio quality of any DMB live release to date. A short tour in several US cities in December of 2002 was highlighted by 2 sold out performances at Madison Square Garden. On 12/21 at MSG, to the surprise and delight of the audience, Dave Matthews Band was joined on stage by James Brown.\n\nThe band's 2003 summer tour culminated with a performance in New York\u2019s Central Park in front of an estimated crowd of in excess of 100,000 fans. The concert helped raise $2 Million for public education and parks in New York City. In November 2003 The Central Park Concert was released on DVD and CD. Captured by 30 cameras in High Definition Widescreen video and recorded in stereo and 5.1 audio, the DVD was directed by Larry Jordan, who worked with the band previously on their Listener Supported.\n\nSummer/Fall 2003 also saw the release of the first solo projects from DMB with the release of Boyd's True Reflections and Dave's Some Devil. The first single from Some Devil, entitled \"Gravedigger,\" earned Dave a Grammy Award for \"Best Male Rock Vocal Performance\".\n\nDave Matthews began a tour in December 2003 to promote his album Some Devil. Dubbed \"Dave Matthews and Friends\" tour, Dave's \"Friends\" included: Trey Anastasio, Brady Blade, Tony Hall, Ray Paczkowski and Tim Reynolds. Emmylou Harris and Spyboy were special guests on the tour. The 12-date tour began in Pennsylvania and ended in California in January 04.\n\nSpring of 2004 found DMB at home in their Virginia studio rehearsing for the summer tour and beginning to mold some new tunes for their forthcoming studio album.\n\nDave Matthews Band's 2004 summer tour proved to be another stream of dynamite concert performances. New songs such as \"Hello Again\", \"Sugar Will\" and \"Joy Ride\" joined older favorites on the setlists. Days after the summer tour ended, DMB played in front of thousands of fans at a \"Concert to Benefit Bay Area Charities\" in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.\n\nIn the first few days of October, Dave Matthews Band joined forces with many other musicians on the \"Vote for Change\" Tour. Presented by MoveOn PAC, all proceeds from the tour benefited American Coming Together (ACT). The \"Vote for Change\" Tour was a multi-city, multi-artist tour that included 37 shows in 33 cities in 12 states over 11 days and featured artists such as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, Bonnie Raitt, Pearl Jam, REM and more.\n\nDMB Live Trax, a highly anticipated series of exclusive live releases, made its debut in the early fall. 12.8.98 Centrum, Worcester, MA was the first release and shortly thereafter, 9.12.04 Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, CA became the second live release in the new series.\n\nDave Matthews Band returned to the studio in the fall of 2004 and continued to shape their next album. Mark Batson, a well-known producer who met DMB in August after their Los Angeles show, was asked by DMB to come to Virginia and help produce the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Dave Matthews Band launched a website devoted to their new studio album. www.dmbnewstudioalbum.com provides fans with video footage and ongoing updates on the album's progress.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Dave Matthews Band made their first trip \"down under\", playing four theater shows in Australia as well as the renowned East Coast Blues & Roots Festival in Byron Bay, Australia. Back in the US, DMB played the 36th Annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival before releasing their acclaimed sixth studio album, Stand Up in May. The release of the album was celebrated by an intimate performance at the Roseland Ballroom in NYC.\n\nDave Matthews Band headlined the 4th Annual Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN and also hosted their own festival at the end of July, the two-day Island Getaway event at New York City's Randall Island. DMB's Island Getaway included performances by Black Eyed Peas, Jem, Mike Doughty, Barenaked Ladies, Ray LaMontagne and Robert Randolph & the Family Band.\n\nFrom the first show of the 2005 summer tour in St. Louis to the four-show tour-ender at Red Rocks, the summer tour was epic and made all the more special by longtime lighting director, Fenton Williams' new stage set and lighting design. The fourth night at Red Rocks was added immediately after Hurricane Katrina struck. The concert, which featured the Neville Brothers on the bill, was a benefit for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Everyone from the concessionaires to the City of Denver pitched in and every cent related to the show -- over a million dollars total -- went to relief charities in the Gulf Coast.\n\nDMB, through their Bama Works Village Recovery Fund, partnered with CARE in 2005 to help tsunami-struck communities in eastern Sri Lanka put their lives back together. Monies donated to the Bama Works Village Recovery Fund are going to CARE to help empower local organizations in tsunami-affected areas to lead the economic and social recovery of their communities. All donations made through the DMB and Warehouse websites were matched 100% by Dave Matthews Band.\n\nDMB performed in Philadelphia, PA on July 2nd, a performance that was part of a series of free global concerts called \"Live 8\". \"Live 8\" concerts were held simultaneously in Philadelphia, PA; London, England; Rome, Italy; Paris, France and Berlin, Germany and were part of the ONE countdown to the G8 Summit. The concerts were part of a movement urging President Bush and other leaders of the world's 8 wealthiest nations to save millions of lives at the G8 Summit in Scotland July 5-8, 2005.\n\n2005 was definitely a year of CD releases. In addition to Stand Up, Live Trax 3, 8.27.2000 Meadows Music Theatre, Hartford, CT and Live Trax 4, 4.30.1996 Classic Amphitheatre, Richmond, VA were released in 2005 and recently, Dave Matthews Band released the Weekend on the Rocks and The Complete Weekend on the Rocks. Weekend on the Rocks features the highlights of all four nights, 9.9.05 - 9.12.05, at Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Complete Weekend on the Rocks features the four full-length shows. Both releases contain a DVD with video highlights of the Red Rocks performances.\n\nDave Matthews Band made a trip to New Orleans in late April 2006 for the annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Shortly before making the trip to Louisiana, DMB issued a $1.5 million challenge grant to help build the New Orleans Habitat Musicians\u2019 Village. The Village is a Habitat for Humanity project that seeks to build more than 300 homes in the city\u2019s Upper Ninth Ward with musicians and other New Orleans residents who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe 2006 annual DMB summer tour found rare songs such as \"Dreaming Tree\" and \"Proudest Monkey\" being rediscovered and new songs like \"The Idea of You\", \"Sister\" and \u201cCan\u2019t Stop\u201d making their debut. The 2006 summer tour production was definitely one of the best yet with DMB taking the live experience to a new level.\n\nA high point in DMB\u2019s career occurred on July 7-8, 2006 when the band performed back-to-back nights in historic Fenway Park with Sheryl Crow performing as support both evenings. Due to feedback and a high demand from fans, within weeks, the Fenway Park concerts were offered as Live Trax volume 6.\n\nDave Matthews Band hosted the second annual two-day Island Getaway event at New York City's Randall Island in August. The 2006 Island Getaway included performances by Gov\u2019t Mule, David Gray, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Slightly Stoopid, Yonder Mountain String Band and Tea Leaf Green.\n\nOther highlights of the summer tour included a return to Chicago with George Clinton performing and a two show tour-closer in DMB\u2019s hometown of Charlottesville, VA, at the new state-of-the-art John Paul Jones Arena.\n\nIn October, Dave Matthews Band had the pleasure and honor of touring as special guest of the Rolling Stones for a show at the Sun Bowl in El Paso, TX and the Qwest Center in Seattle, WA.\n\n2006 was another year chock full of releases! In addition to the rush release of the Fenway Park shows, a show from 1995 and 1996 were pulled out of the vaults based on requests from fans to release older shows in the Live Trax series.\n\nLive Trax 5: 8.23.1995 Meadow Brook Music Festival, Rochester Hills, MI\nLive Trax 6: 7.7 \u2013 7.8.2006 Fenway Park, Boston, MA\nLive Trax 7: 12.31.1996 Hampton Coliseum, Hampton, VA\n\nIn October, DMB released its double CD, Best of What\u2019s Around, Vol. 1, featuring the essential studio songs on one disc and a disc of live songs picked by fans from a survey DMB held earlier in the year.\n\nDave Matthews Band announced their plan in June to arrange for NativeEnergy and Clean Air-Cool Planet to offset 100% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from their touring activities since 1991. By offsetting the CO2 pollution that touring activities such as transporting gear, powering stages and air travel generate, Dave Matthews Band has taken a proactive role in fighting global warming and helping Native America to restore sustainable homeland economies in balance with the Earth.\n\nWith NativeEnergy, the band ensures that its CO2 offsetting actually contributes directly to the construction of new, Native American and Native Alaskan renewable energy generators whose clean electricity will displace energy that would otherwise have to come from polluting coal-fired plants, reducing CO2 and other pollution on behalf of the band. In addition, DMB\u2019s purchase supports financially additional offsets from wind farms in the Great Plains, that displace electricity on one of the most intensely coal-fired grids in the country.\n\nDave Matthews Band wants to send thanks to those that have supported their tsunami relief efforts. In 2005, DMB, through their Bama Works Village Recovery Fund, partnered with CARE to help tsunami-struck communities in eastern Sri Lanka put their lives back together. The Bama Works Village Recovery Fund monies raised helped CARE to provide the following relief in 2006:\n\n* CARE helped construct transitional housing for over 1,000 people who lost their homes to the tsunami.\n* Going forward, CARE plans to construct 591 permanent homes for families in the area.\n* CARE has constructed latrines, wells and water storage tanks for communities living in transitional shelters.\n* Over 580 people from 12 villages were employed by CARE to clear garbage and debris from roads and farmland.\n* CARE helped some 3,500 people regain their livelihoods by providing tools, supplies and cash grants.\n* Other CARE programs supported schools and provided psychosocial support for those affected by the tsunami, especially people living in transitional shelters.\n\nDMB trekked the globe in 2007 with a return trip to Australia as well as a European tour.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.verizon.com/pay-it-forward-live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hennessey Bonfire LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7405314.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Folk, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hennessey Bonfire is the world pop project of songwriter and percussionist Shawn Hennessey (Leana Song).

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tiedye Ky ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8268431.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "https://soundcloud.com/tiedyeky", "otherInfo": "Venture through a realm of deep basslines as Bassrush x Twenty Twenty Global present The Glitch Mob, Ivy Lab, Thriftworks, + Tiedye Ky"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eric Chesser ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9172648.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Eric Chesser, is an American Country Music Singer-Songwriter.

He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros.

Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

I\n\nJohn Keith Culbreth (aka Cubby) was 16 years old\u2014no longer the religious child he had been back in his childhood days spent in Anderson, SC\u2014but was, unknowingly, poised for a divine intervention of life-altering proportions. While peacefully sleeping after a classmate's musical performance, an entity presented itself to Cubby\u2014the entity presented itself as God. \"It was the most vivid dream I had ever had,\" says Cubby. \"It felt so bizarre.\" \"God\" spoke to Cubby. It told him to contact his classmate, Will Blackburn, and come together to create music. Cubby obliged, Blackburn agreed, and the band proceeded to practice for over a year, never playing a show.\n\nStop Light Observations' inaugural performance took place on Sullivan's Island. Among the crowd was Cubby's childhood pastor\u2014a man with whom he had once had a close relationship. As it turns out, Cubby's former pastor was Will Blackburn's grandfather. Divinity had served up fate. Cubby and Blackburn had been childhood friends, but never knew it. SLO was born, and the sky was the limit.\n\nBut things didn't truly take off until a few years later when SLO released their acclaimed 2013 debut, Radiation. Metronome hailed the record's \"emotive and elegant\" songs, which landed perfectly in the sweet spot between arena and indie rock. The band went from relative unknowns to playing Bonnaroo and selling out Charleston's largest club, The Music Farm, in just a year.\n\nSince then, Stop Light Observations have broken the record for most consecutive sold-out shows at The Music Farm and have toured across the country, playing standout festival sets at Firefly, Summerfest, and more. SLO's most recent LP, Toogoodoo, saw coverage at major national outlets from PBS and Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Fresh Noise to Impose, PopMatters and Garden & Gun, the latter praising Toogoodoo as \"a promising debut from the band, who have wowed audiences throughout the South.\u201d\n\nNow, following the successful release of Toogoodoo, and an ambitious year on the road in support, Stop Light Observations are poised to tackle their next major endeavor\u2014an ongoing series of digital 45s, each with an A-side and B-side, entitled The Volume, which will disperse the band\u2019s hard-hitting yet melodic songs in a more immediate fashion.\n\n\"The Volume is much more than just bypassing the mechanics of an album,\" Cubby explains. \"Its about inspiring ourselves and others with this approach that lends itself to complete creative freedom. The Beatles released 250-plus songs in 7 years without the technology we have today. If they can do it, why can't we?\"\n\nAt the center of the first volume is Stop Light Observations' new single, \"Coyote.\" It\u2019s a stunning, slow-building piano ballad that evolves strikingly through distinct dynamic phases, vocalist Will Blackburn's effortlessly toggling between a delicate croon and an anthemic howl. With \"Coyote,\" the group distills its already potent arena-ready indie rock all the way through the song's powerful crescendo of an outro.\n\nThematically, \u201cCoyote\u201d deals with loss\u2014something the entire band has coped with many times over the years. \"The situations and emotions behind our songs are extremely personal,\" SLO guitarist Louis Duffie explains.\n\nCubby adds, \"When I was 15, I started dating my childhood sweetheart\u2014who is now my wife\u2014and after our first year of dating we received the earth-shattering news that her best friend, Lizzy, had committed suicide. She was the sweetest, happiest, and kindest girl in our entire high school and to believe she would take her own life was unfathomable. 'Coyote' is that story for me\u2014the story of the pack animal, still feeling alone despite its family joining in its howls of pain. It is the girl with the bright smile taking her life\u2014the fallen angel. It's the first time you meet up with all your friends and that person you all loved so much isn't there.\"\n\nThe first installment from The Volume also offers up \"The Ghost of Larry Ford Jr.,\" an instrumental track that tackles the next step of loss: the frustration, anger and anxiety of letting go, all seamlessly communicated sans lyrics. The stylized, labyrinthine track sounds like a Wes Anderson films looks, along the way deftly mapping the chaotic trajectory of a mind in mourning.\n\nStop Light Observations may be blazing their own trails, but they want everyone to join them on their journey\u2014fans, friends and family, past and present. \"The Volume releases will ultimately be defined as a series\u2014a voice for the voiceless. A podium for those who have yearned for the opportunity to share their own stories of struggle, passion, and love,\" vocalist Will Blackburn explains.\n\n\"We live in an era of polar divisions perpetuated by fear,\" Blackburn continues. \"And the divide seems to be growing exponentially. But if we turn off the cable news channel and walk out our front doors and speak to our neighbors, we may find that our struggles, while they vary, are often quite relatable. It is my hope that trough this style of releasing music that we may open up the conversations that need to be addressed most in today's America. All are equal and all opinions should be heard with hopes of perpetuating peace and understanding. Love is the way and this is the path we have chosen to move forward.\"", "otherInfo": "Will is playing solo tomorrow at 7 EST!

A philosophy derived from the Japanese art of repairing cracked ceramics with gold to highlight flaws instead of hiding them, kintsugi speaks to the way an object's history is part of its aesthetic value. \"Considering what we were going through internally, and with what a lot of the lyrics are about, it had a great deal of resonance for us \u2014 the idea of figuring out how to repair breaks and make them a thing of beauty,\" says bassist Nick Harmer, who suggested the name to singer-guitarist Ben Gibbard and drummer Jason McGerr. \"Philosophically, spiritually, emotionally, it seems perfect for this group of songs.\"\nLong before they gave the album its name, the band embarked on a process that forced them to do things differently than they ever had before. For instance, in the course of making their seven previous albums, the Seattle band hadn't written much in the studio together. They had always preferred to hone their arrangements separately, or with just two or three of them playing at once. But when it came time to record Kintsugi, Death Cab for Cutie went into the studio with the openest of minds. Their willingness to try anything \u2014 including a twenty-minute exploration that evolved into one of the album's finest tracks, \"The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive\" \u2014 yields Death Cab's most compelling new work in years: an album that packs as much sonic as it does emotional wallop.\nKintsugi is the band's first time recording with a producer other than their own Chris Walla, the guitarist and multi-instrumentalist whose talents behind the board had helped shape Death Cab's sound since Gibbard released the You Can Play These Songs With Chords cassette in 1997. For Kintsugi, they worked with Rich Costey (whose production credits include albums by Franz Ferdinand, Muse, and Interpol), recording at his Los Angeles studio Eldorado over the course of twelve weeks in the first half of 2014. \"He was all in in a way that I don't think a lot of producers are nowadays,\" says Gibbard. \"We couldn't have landed on a better collaborator for this record. He accomplished what we've always attempted, which is to make Death Cab sound on a record how we sound live. And we're a rock band live. The difficulty now for the live show is making them rock as hard as they rock on the record. That's a new quagmire for this band.\"\nWork on Kintsugi began back in early 2013, as all Death Cab LPs have, with Gibbard writing and demoing the songs on his own before arranging and recording them with his band mates. They initially convened in fall of 2013 at Walla's Hall Of Justice studio in Seattle. Ten days into recording, Chris decided to step down as producer. Says Gibbard. \"Nothing dramatic, he just said, 'I don't think I'm the right guy to do this album and we should find someone else.'\" The band all felt that they needed to shake things up a bit. \"We challenged each other more and left no stone unturned. That was as gratifying as it was frustrating at times, but I couldn't be happier with the end product,\" says McGerr. Walla has since decided to leave the band but participated in the recording process as fully and vitally as he had on their previous albums. In fact, Costey didn't even know Walla was leaving the band until after Kintsugi was finished. Chris played his final show with the band in September at Rifflandia Festival in British Columbia.\nWhen they started recording, there weren't any rules at all. They'd work on a song for a while and then regroup with Costey to figure out elements to expand or elaborate. \"These guys have a chemistry that's existed for a long time, and that chemistry can't be ignored,\" says Costey. \"When you have a band that can play as well as they can play with each other, having them jam together in real time can actually be the quickest way to try a bunch of ideas and get them on tape.\" Songs such as the instantly memorable \"Good Help (Is So Hard To Find),\" the warm and vulnerable \"Little Wanderer\" and the brooding lead single \"Black Sun\" were all tracked with the four members of the band playing together in a room, reacting to each other in real time, adding layers \u2014 and later subtracting some. \"All four of us being on the floor together in the studio was something that hadn't happened in years, because Chris was always behind the glass or in the control room,\" says McGerr. \"But this was more like when we're onstage, where everyone has their eyes closed and we're playing in the moment. With 'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive,' it turned into a twenty-minute thing they captured in the control room on a two-track. We had started it in Seattle months prior and it just wasn't getting there. Rich brought us into the control room and was like, 'This is our song.'\"\nCostey credits another element of their production set-up with helping achieve the perfect balance of their classic approach and the new one: \"My studio has one big live recording space and two control rooms,\" he says. \"Once we got basic tracks together, Chris would work on them in the other control room. And he would end up doing completely different versions of the songs. For 'Black Sun,' Chris did all this super old school sequenced synth stuff that we used on the final track, and it really brought that song to another level.\"\n\"Black Sun\" is also a perfect example of Gibbard's customarily honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. \"'Black Sun' is about divorce and the ugliness and conflicting emotions that come with that: anger, sadness, finger-pointing, acceptance, forgiveness, understanding. To me, the idea of a black sun has multiple meanings: The black sun could be an eclipse, where one thing eclipses another. The sun is supposed to be a radiating light on the world but in this instance it is blacked out. We've all been that at some point in our life when we're supposed to be shining upon someone giving them support, but for some reason are unable to do that. I am the black sun, and the song is as much an indictment of myself as anything.\"\nAlthough, in the case of \"Black Sun,\" Gibbard says he's willing to elaborate on the elements of the song that are autobiographical, he's never been one to reveal the precise meaning behind his lyrics. \"I know that people will assume these songs are about certain things, and in some instances they are going to be correct,\" he says. \"But I'm not going to give people a road map.\"\nGibbard acknowledges that, early on in the process of writing this group of songs, as he was still trying to make sense of the major changes happening in his life, he had to remind himself not to change his creative process. \"If there's a reason people can relate to my songwriting, maybe it's they feel like they're getting an honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. I'm certainly not going to censor that just because people think they know something about my personal life. I would be cowardly as a songwriter and not be true to what I've always done if I shy away from these events in my life because I was in relationship with a public figure.\n\"I know the lyrics aren't 100% fiction and they're not 100% nonfiction, and only Ben knows what that blend is,\" says Harmer. \"But with this group of songs, I do think he is writing from a genuinely vulnerable and honest place and I'm proud of him for putting himself out there and being fearless about it.\"\nOne of the songs on Kintsugi that Gibbard says he holds closest to his heart is \"Little Wanderer,\" where he sings, \"You sent a photo out of your window of Paris of what you wished that I could see. But someone's gotta be the lighthouse and that someone's gotta be me.\" He explains: \"There are innumerable songs about, like, 'The road ain't no place to start a family.' 'Home Sweet Home' by Motley Crue, 'Gone Til November,' by Wyclef Jean, and so on. But nobody ever writes a song about sitting at home, waiting for someone to come back. And for so much of my life, I've been the one off somewhere in the world trying to maintain a connection through digital portals. Now, being with someone who travels pretty much all the time, I feel like I've gotten a taste of my own medicine. All the songs are personal, but that one is personal in a way that is very tender to me.\"\nHere, too, \"The Ghosts of Beverly Drive\" encapsulates important elements of the album's larger theme \u2014 embracing flaws and being open to change. \"If only you had known me before the accident,\" it begins, \"for with that grand collision came a grave consequence.\" Says Gibbard: \"There's this charade you play with someone when you start seeing each other, that no one has ever made you feel this way before,\" says Gibbard. \"'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive' is about when you say to the person you're with, 'Let's just acknowledge that we are not the first people to feel this way. Let's be honest with each other that we've been in love before or that we've fallen out of love with people before, and that's OK.'\"", "otherInfo": "5/28 is the last weekly show, tune in at 4pm PT!

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent.

These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week.

It was born out of tragedy after the band's guitar player, Grae McCullough, lost his one-month-old daughter to a chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18. \"The peace I had the day Lizzie's short life ended could have only been God. There was an underlying sense of peace in the devastation and the song really encapsulates the situation we were in,\" says McCoullough.\n\nBlakesley has been featured on Sirius XM, EWTN\u2019s Life on the Rock, Relevant Radio, KLOVE and has performed with wide variety of Christian artists like Matt Maher, Andrew Peterson, Jars of Clay and the Newsboys; as well as several International Papal events, most recently in Milan, Italy in 2012.

Her dog is buried in the garden along the eastern wall; sometimes, she wonders if the ground will bloom half-a-dozen of him under a certain kind of moon. In the morning the light creeps sideways through the windows and lights her up from the chest down, her head nestled in the shadow. Sometimes she finds herself playing guitar before she has left sleep. Her hands strum but her mind is still dreaming. (It\u2019s her birthday, she\u2019s at the movies, the screen is a tidal wave, someone touches her leg, she wakes up with her fingers tangled in the strings and the kettle whistling.)\n\nThe house is haunted. It should go without saying, but it should be said anyway. The house is haunted, but no one knows anything about the ghost or how it messes with you, except for the fact that every time she goes away (to Texas, to Memphis, to Graceland, to Germany) she always ends up coming home again. It\u2019s the strangest kind of haunting. Everyone calls it, the house, the House of Punishment\u2014more than one mistaken citizen has turned up looking for a similarly-named erotic dungeon on the other side of town\u2014but the name is misleading. It is not a house where someone was punished, or a house where someone might be punished, but a house that replaces punishment; instead of feeling guilt or regret you must play quietly in any corner, and eventually the emotion will resolve itself.\n\nInside, every door frame is notched: the respective growths of former tenants, friends. On one of them, a place where\u2014deep in her cups\u2014she\u2019d measured her height as a full five inches taller than normal; only the next morning did she realize, cotton-mouthed, that she\u2019d been standing on her toes when she\u2019d slid the pencil over the apex of her skull. There had been a Murphy bed once, she was certain, and sometimes when she was very, very tired she would imagine her bed, which was not a Murphy bed, snapping her up into the wall. Next to her bed, in her nightstand drawer, lived the following things: crumpled receipts, red yarn, eight dollars, a white lighter, two undeveloped film cameras, Grether\u2019s Pastilles in their old-timey tin, fistfuls of birthday cards with the shimmer worn off, a pocket-sized copy of the constitution, a pocket knife, a pair of swimming goggles, a pair of recording headphones, shoelaces twisted into a Gordian knot, an unpaid parking ticket, a strip of Peanuts Halloween stickers, an MRI request form from when she sprained her finger, colloidal silver (someone told her it would cure her cold; someone else told her it would give her Argyria), a map of Kyoto (she\u2019d gotten bored at the temple), incense, her first fan letter (she promised herself she\u2019d respond; she never did), a bunch of bolts, a plastic doll\u2019s hand, doggie bags (he\u2019d died over a year ago), an unopened Replacements cassette, an unopened 23 & Me kit, an unopened fortune cookie, unopened pepper spray she doesn\u2019t trust herself to take out of the packaging. In a fake book on her desk\u2014pleather-bound and conspicuously absent a title\u2014she collects her used boarding passes, old concert tickets, disconnected wristbands. It doesn\u2019t escape her notice that she can\u2019t throw anything away, that objects remain unopened, unresolved, untangled, unconsumed. She is always in the middle. She is never at the end of anything.\n\nShe lives near a hospital. All night, she hears sirens, imagines the people being transported to and fro, their bodies speeding along in the back of ambulances and their spirit trying to catch up. She makes jokes. \u201cIf I wake up, someone better be dying,\u201d she says, until one night she wakes up and feels it: someone\u2019s essence slipping past her on the way to somewhere else. After that, she thinks about the hospital as a metaphor, and considers the many ailments the metaphorical hospital could cure, the many symptoms it could treat: Imposter syndrome. Cabin fever. Foot-in-mouth disease. Word vomit.\n\nShe invites her friends\u2014that is to say, her family\u2014over for dinner. She has this one friend whose dad was really obsessed with blood\u2014blood as in family, not the interesting kind of blood\u2014and how it was thicker than water (ew), and then one day her friend looked up the actual expression and it was, The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Shit, right? Anyway, she makes a green bean casserole, which is demolished in short order, and hot rolls. Someone kills a pint of ice cream she\u2019s been saving. Someone else drinks a beer so hard it sputters, erupts. Someone else sits in the corner playing cat\u2019s cradle, waiting to feel the guilt lift from their sternum.\n\nAfter that, the coven of her covenant goes out beneath the new moon; they journal and play Bright Eyes and Britney Spears and act out Mar\u00eda Irene Forn\u00e9s\u2019 plays and eat peaches. They lie on the grass and the stone and talk about the skies they were born under. They don\u2019t believe, really, that it makes a difference, but it\u2019s nice to think about. After all, everyone knows the world is ending. They\u2019ve been told as much, and they can see it in the streets, and they know the world is irreparably fucked, but most importantly they feel it among themselves; they know this goodness cannot last forever.\n\nShe sits near them. They are together but at the same time they are alone, as we all are. Someone has put a braid into her hair; she\u2019s left toothmarks on someone else. Something moves through the empty house, less the ghost than the breath of the ghost. She tells her friends: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to disappear.\u201d Someone laughs. Then, someone else opens their mouth, and something else climbs out.\n\nCarmen Maria Machado, March 2020", "otherInfo": "VICE's second installment of Noisey Night In, a virtual concert fundraiser to support artists impacted by the pandemic.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important.

Instead of simply recording himself with a guitar, he opted to bring in some instrumental help to give his musical ideas more depth. Dave found assistance in drummer Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore, who were both accomplished jazz musicians in the local Charlottesville music scene. Based on the recommendation of distinguished local jazz guru John D\u2019earth, 16-year-old musical prodigy Stefan Lessard came on board to play bass. Completing the band was keyboard player Peter Griesar, who left the band after a couple of years, as well as the talented and classically trained violinist, Boyd Tinsley.\n\nThe first public performance of Dave Matthews Band occurred at the City of Charlottesville\u2019s Earth Day Festival in April 1991. The first official gig for the newly conceived Dave Matthews Band was May 11, 1991, at a private party held on the rooftop of the pink warehouse on South Street in downtown Charlottesville. Local weekly gigs soon followed at Eastern Standard and then Trax nightclub, and within a little time, word of the band\u2019s contagious new sound spread like wildfire throughout the region. Clubs started to fill up, tours began to cover more territory, and the fan base grew at an incredible rate.\n\nOn November 9, 1993, DMB released its first album, Remember Two Things, on its Bama Rags label. The album was recorded live at The Muse Music Club on Nantucket Island, in August of 1993. The album debuted on College charts as the highest independent entry, and went on to be certified gold by the RIAA -- a significant accomplishment for an independent album. Meanwhile, the band kept touring and its fan base continued to grow. By allowing fans to tape shows for their personal use, DMB created a highly interactive community that continues in spirit today.\n\nDuring the first part of 1994, Dave Matthews Band recorded its RCA debut, Under The Table and Dreaming. Just before the album\u2019s release on September 27, 1994, Dave Matthews Band hit the road for their first official national tour. The tour lasted well over a year and included sold out theater dates across the country, a trip to Europe, and two summers playing on the main stage of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. By the fall of 1995, when the band returned to the studio to record its next album, Under The Table and Dreaming had been certified four times platinum by the RIAA.\n\nCrash, Dave Matthews Band\u2019s second RCA studio album, was released on April 30, 1996, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The band continued with a steady schedule of touring throughout 1997, headlining sold-out amphitheater dates across North America. DMB, though elevated to the level of national pop stardom, continued to do things precisely as it had from day one: organically, with a grass roots mentality.\n\nOn October 28, 1997, Bama Rags/RCA label released an official double-disc live Dave Matthews Band album, entitled Live at Red Rocks 8-15-95. Without any marketing or promotion, Live at Red Rocks debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart and was instantly certified platinum. The album provided fans with a high quality and reasonably priced alternative to the over-priced, ill produced, and illegal live DMB CDs that were beginning to flood the bootleg black-market. The overwhelming success of Live at Red Rocks, combined with the band\u2019s tremendous touring achievements, proved that Dave Matthews Band had grown from a grass roots phenomenon to one of the hottest bands in America.\n\nOn April 28, 1998, RCA released Dave Matthews Band\u2019s third studio album, Before These Crowded Streets. The critically acclaimed recording debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart; it was the band\u2019s strongest debut to date. DMB spent the following year and a half on the road, selling out stadiums, arenas, and amphitheaters across the country.\n\nOn January 19, 1999, Bama Rags/RCA released Live at Luther College: An Acoustic Performance by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. Tim Reynolds was a guest guitarist on all of the Dave Matthews Band albums, and toured with the band as a guest musician. Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds toured as an acoustic duo during the winters of \u201996, \u201997, and \u201999. The second in a series of live Dave Matthews Band-related releases, Live at Luther College debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and has since been certified platinum by the RIAA . As with Live at Red Rocks, the success of this second live album was based solely on word-of-mouth buzz.\n\nThe third installment in the ongoing live album series, Listener Supported, was released by Bama Rags/RCA on November 23, 1999. The album was recorded live at New Jersey's Continental Airlines Arena in September 1999, and a video of the performance, also titled \"Listener Supported\", was released at the same time. The double-disc album was quickly certified double platinum, and the video has sold over a million copies as well.\n\nThe band spent much of 2000 on tour, finishing as the top-grossing touring band in the U.S. In the fall, Dave Matthews joined legendary producer Glen Ballard in Los Angeles to fine-tune song arrangements for a new album, and the pair wound up co-writing 12 new songs in a matter of days. From this explosion of creative chemistry came the band's fourth studio album, Everyday, released February 27, 2001. Matthews played electric guitar for the first time, and Ballard helped the band focus and tighten their arrangements, resulting in the phenomenal success of Everyday, which has since gone triple platinum.\n\nDMB spent the summer of 2001 touring the country and exposing sold-out audiences to songs from Everyday. On August 21, \"Dave Matthews Band, The Videos 1994-2001\", was released on DVD and VHS. For the first time, the entire collection of Dave Matthews Band videos (the first 12) was presented together, along with director commentary and behind the scenes footage.\n\nOn October 23, 2001, the band released its fourth live release, Live In Chicago, 12.19.98, featuring guest musicians such as Victor Wooten, Maceo Parker, and a full set with Tim Reynolds.\n\nThe band regrouped in January 2002 at the familiar Plant Studios in Sausalito, CA where they had recorded their 3rd RCA release Before These Crowded Streets. The band revisited tracks they had previously written and recorded in 2000 and collaborated on a couple of new tunes that had debuted in recent months. The resultant creation, Busted Stuff, was made available July 16, 2002. Busted Stuff is a landmark record for DMB; for the first time ever, this album is without any musical guests. Included on the album are road-tested fan favorites such as \u201cBartender\u201d, \u201cGrey Street\u201d, \u201cWhere Are You Going\u201d, and \"Grace Is Gone\".\n\nFollowing a successful tour throughout the US in Summer 2002, Dave Matthews Band released Live At Folsom Field, Boulder CO, the band's 5th live release overall. This double CD / DVD / VHS from the band's 7/11/01 performance, contains first ever live versions of songs from Everyday and Busted Stuff, such as \"When The World Ends,\" \"So Right,\" \"What You Are,\" \"If I Had It All,\" \"Angel,\" \"The Space Between,\" \"Everyday\" \"Big Eyed Fish,\" \"Digging A Ditch,\" and \"Bartender.\" The DVD utilizes footage taken from 22 cameras, was recorded in 5.1 surround sound, and presents the finest audio quality of any DMB live release to date. A short tour in several US cities in December of 2002 was highlighted by 2 sold out performances at Madison Square Garden. On 12/21 at MSG, to the surprise and delight of the audience, Dave Matthews Band was joined on stage by James Brown.\n\nThe band's 2003 summer tour culminated with a performance in New York\u2019s Central Park in front of an estimated crowd of in excess of 100,000 fans. The concert helped raise $2 Million for public education and parks in New York City. In November 2003 The Central Park Concert was released on DVD and CD. Captured by 30 cameras in High Definition Widescreen video and recorded in stereo and 5.1 audio, the DVD was directed by Larry Jordan, who worked with the band previously on their Listener Supported.\n\nSummer/Fall 2003 also saw the release of the first solo projects from DMB with the release of Boyd's True Reflections and Dave's Some Devil. The first single from Some Devil, entitled \"Gravedigger,\" earned Dave a Grammy Award for \"Best Male Rock Vocal Performance\".\n\nDave Matthews began a tour in December 2003 to promote his album Some Devil. Dubbed \"Dave Matthews and Friends\" tour, Dave's \"Friends\" included: Trey Anastasio, Brady Blade, Tony Hall, Ray Paczkowski and Tim Reynolds. Emmylou Harris and Spyboy were special guests on the tour. The 12-date tour began in Pennsylvania and ended in California in January 04.\n\nSpring of 2004 found DMB at home in their Virginia studio rehearsing for the summer tour and beginning to mold some new tunes for their forthcoming studio album.\n\nDave Matthews Band's 2004 summer tour proved to be another stream of dynamite concert performances. New songs such as \"Hello Again\", \"Sugar Will\" and \"Joy Ride\" joined older favorites on the setlists. Days after the summer tour ended, DMB played in front of thousands of fans at a \"Concert to Benefit Bay Area Charities\" in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.\n\nIn the first few days of October, Dave Matthews Band joined forces with many other musicians on the \"Vote for Change\" Tour. Presented by MoveOn PAC, all proceeds from the tour benefited American Coming Together (ACT). The \"Vote for Change\" Tour was a multi-city, multi-artist tour that included 37 shows in 33 cities in 12 states over 11 days and featured artists such as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, Bonnie Raitt, Pearl Jam, REM and more.\n\nDMB Live Trax, a highly anticipated series of exclusive live releases, made its debut in the early fall. 12.8.98 Centrum, Worcester, MA was the first release and shortly thereafter, 9.12.04 Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, CA became the second live release in the new series.\n\nDave Matthews Band returned to the studio in the fall of 2004 and continued to shape their next album. Mark Batson, a well-known producer who met DMB in August after their Los Angeles show, was asked by DMB to come to Virginia and help produce the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Dave Matthews Band launched a website devoted to their new studio album. www.dmbnewstudioalbum.com provides fans with video footage and ongoing updates on the album's progress.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Dave Matthews Band made their first trip \"down under\", playing four theater shows in Australia as well as the renowned East Coast Blues & Roots Festival in Byron Bay, Australia. Back in the US, DMB played the 36th Annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival before releasing their acclaimed sixth studio album, Stand Up in May. The release of the album was celebrated by an intimate performance at the Roseland Ballroom in NYC.\n\nDave Matthews Band headlined the 4th Annual Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN and also hosted their own festival at the end of July, the two-day Island Getaway event at New York City's Randall Island. DMB's Island Getaway included performances by Black Eyed Peas, Jem, Mike Doughty, Barenaked Ladies, Ray LaMontagne and Robert Randolph & the Family Band.\n\nFrom the first show of the 2005 summer tour in St. Louis to the four-show tour-ender at Red Rocks, the summer tour was epic and made all the more special by longtime lighting director, Fenton Williams' new stage set and lighting design. The fourth night at Red Rocks was added immediately after Hurricane Katrina struck. The concert, which featured the Neville Brothers on the bill, was a benefit for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Everyone from the concessionaires to the City of Denver pitched in and every cent related to the show -- over a million dollars total -- went to relief charities in the Gulf Coast.\n\nDMB, through their Bama Works Village Recovery Fund, partnered with CARE in 2005 to help tsunami-struck communities in eastern Sri Lanka put their lives back together. Monies donated to the Bama Works Village Recovery Fund are going to CARE to help empower local organizations in tsunami-affected areas to lead the economic and social recovery of their communities. All donations made through the DMB and Warehouse websites were matched 100% by Dave Matthews Band.\n\nDMB performed in Philadelphia, PA on July 2nd, a performance that was part of a series of free global concerts called \"Live 8\". \"Live 8\" concerts were held simultaneously in Philadelphia, PA; London, England; Rome, Italy; Paris, France and Berlin, Germany and were part of the ONE countdown to the G8 Summit. The concerts were part of a movement urging President Bush and other leaders of the world's 8 wealthiest nations to save millions of lives at the G8 Summit in Scotland July 5-8, 2005.\n\n2005 was definitely a year of CD releases. In addition to Stand Up, Live Trax 3, 8.27.2000 Meadows Music Theatre, Hartford, CT and Live Trax 4, 4.30.1996 Classic Amphitheatre, Richmond, VA were released in 2005 and recently, Dave Matthews Band released the Weekend on the Rocks and The Complete Weekend on the Rocks. Weekend on the Rocks features the highlights of all four nights, 9.9.05 - 9.12.05, at Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Complete Weekend on the Rocks features the four full-length shows. Both releases contain a DVD with video highlights of the Red Rocks performances.\n\nDave Matthews Band made a trip to New Orleans in late April 2006 for the annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Shortly before making the trip to Louisiana, DMB issued a $1.5 million challenge grant to help build the New Orleans Habitat Musicians\u2019 Village. The Village is a Habitat for Humanity project that seeks to build more than 300 homes in the city\u2019s Upper Ninth Ward with musicians and other New Orleans residents who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe 2006 annual DMB summer tour found rare songs such as \"Dreaming Tree\" and \"Proudest Monkey\" being rediscovered and new songs like \"The Idea of You\", \"Sister\" and \u201cCan\u2019t Stop\u201d making their debut. The 2006 summer tour production was definitely one of the best yet with DMB taking the live experience to a new level.\n\nA high point in DMB\u2019s career occurred on July 7-8, 2006 when the band performed back-to-back nights in historic Fenway Park with Sheryl Crow performing as support both evenings. Due to feedback and a high demand from fans, within weeks, the Fenway Park concerts were offered as Live Trax volume 6.\n\nDave Matthews Band hosted the second annual two-day Island Getaway event at New York City's Randall Island in August. The 2006 Island Getaway included performances by Gov\u2019t Mule, David Gray, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Slightly Stoopid, Yonder Mountain String Band and Tea Leaf Green.\n\nOther highlights of the summer tour included a return to Chicago with George Clinton performing and a two show tour-closer in DMB\u2019s hometown of Charlottesville, VA, at the new state-of-the-art John Paul Jones Arena.\n\nIn October, Dave Matthews Band had the pleasure and honor of touring as special guest of the Rolling Stones for a show at the Sun Bowl in El Paso, TX and the Qwest Center in Seattle, WA.\n\n2006 was another year chock full of releases! In addition to the rush release of the Fenway Park shows, a show from 1995 and 1996 were pulled out of the vaults based on requests from fans to release older shows in the Live Trax series.\n\nLive Trax 5: 8.23.1995 Meadow Brook Music Festival, Rochester Hills, MI\nLive Trax 6: 7.7 \u2013 7.8.2006 Fenway Park, Boston, MA\nLive Trax 7: 12.31.1996 Hampton Coliseum, Hampton, VA\n\nIn October, DMB released its double CD, Best of What\u2019s Around, Vol. 1, featuring the essential studio songs on one disc and a disc of live songs picked by fans from a survey DMB held earlier in the year.\n\nDave Matthews Band announced their plan in June to arrange for NativeEnergy and Clean Air-Cool Planet to offset 100% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from their touring activities since 1991. By offsetting the CO2 pollution that touring activities such as transporting gear, powering stages and air travel generate, Dave Matthews Band has taken a proactive role in fighting global warming and helping Native America to restore sustainable homeland economies in balance with the Earth.\n\nWith NativeEnergy, the band ensures that its CO2 offsetting actually contributes directly to the construction of new, Native American and Native Alaskan renewable energy generators whose clean electricity will displace energy that would otherwise have to come from polluting coal-fired plants, reducing CO2 and other pollution on behalf of the band. In addition, DMB\u2019s purchase supports financially additional offsets from wind farms in the Great Plains, that displace electricity on one of the most intensely coal-fired grids in the country.\n\nDave Matthews Band wants to send thanks to those that have supported their tsunami relief efforts. In 2005, DMB, through their Bama Works Village Recovery Fund, partnered with CARE to help tsunami-struck communities in eastern Sri Lanka put their lives back together. The Bama Works Village Recovery Fund monies raised helped CARE to provide the following relief in 2006:\n\n* CARE helped construct transitional housing for over 1,000 people who lost their homes to the tsunami.\n* Going forward, CARE plans to construct 591 permanent homes for families in the area.\n* CARE has constructed latrines, wells and water storage tanks for communities living in transitional shelters.\n* Over 580 people from 12 villages were employed by CARE to clear garbage and debris from roads and farmland.\n* CARE helped some 3,500 people regain their livelihoods by providing tools, supplies and cash grants.\n* Other CARE programs supported schools and provided psychosocial support for those affected by the tsunami, especially people living in transitional shelters.\n\nDMB trekked the globe in 2007 with a return trip to Australia as well as a European tour.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.verizon.com/pay-it-forward-live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AL1CE LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8432226.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Fantasy, Dream, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "AL1CE is a multimedia performing arts rock group that fuses dance, surrealist art, video, world music, electronica and rock into a veritable broth of sound and vision.

She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012.

Her dog is buried in the garden along the eastern wall; sometimes, she wonders if the ground will bloom half-a-dozen of him under a certain kind of moon. In the morning the light creeps sideways through the windows and lights her up from the chest down, her head nestled in the shadow. Sometimes she finds herself playing guitar before she has left sleep. Her hands strum but her mind is still dreaming. (It\u2019s her birthday, she\u2019s at the movies, the screen is a tidal wave, someone touches her leg, she wakes up with her fingers tangled in the strings and the kettle whistling.)\n\nThe house is haunted. It should go without saying, but it should be said anyway. The house is haunted, but no one knows anything about the ghost or how it messes with you, except for the fact that every time she goes away (to Texas, to Memphis, to Graceland, to Germany) she always ends up coming home again. It\u2019s the strangest kind of haunting. Everyone calls it, the house, the House of Punishment\u2014more than one mistaken citizen has turned up looking for a similarly-named erotic dungeon on the other side of town\u2014but the name is misleading. It is not a house where someone was punished, or a house where someone might be punished, but a house that replaces punishment; instead of feeling guilt or regret you must play quietly in any corner, and eventually the emotion will resolve itself.\n\nInside, every door frame is notched: the respective growths of former tenants, friends. On one of them, a place where\u2014deep in her cups\u2014she\u2019d measured her height as a full five inches taller than normal; only the next morning did she realize, cotton-mouthed, that she\u2019d been standing on her toes when she\u2019d slid the pencil over the apex of her skull. There had been a Murphy bed once, she was certain, and sometimes when she was very, very tired she would imagine her bed, which was not a Murphy bed, snapping her up into the wall. Next to her bed, in her nightstand drawer, lived the following things: crumpled receipts, red yarn, eight dollars, a white lighter, two undeveloped film cameras, Grether\u2019s Pastilles in their old-timey tin, fistfuls of birthday cards with the shimmer worn off, a pocket-sized copy of the constitution, a pocket knife, a pair of swimming goggles, a pair of recording headphones, shoelaces twisted into a Gordian knot, an unpaid parking ticket, a strip of Peanuts Halloween stickers, an MRI request form from when she sprained her finger, colloidal silver (someone told her it would cure her cold; someone else told her it would give her Argyria), a map of Kyoto (she\u2019d gotten bored at the temple), incense, her first fan letter (she promised herself she\u2019d respond; she never did), a bunch of bolts, a plastic doll\u2019s hand, doggie bags (he\u2019d died over a year ago), an unopened Replacements cassette, an unopened 23 & Me kit, an unopened fortune cookie, unopened pepper spray she doesn\u2019t trust herself to take out of the packaging. In a fake book on her desk\u2014pleather-bound and conspicuously absent a title\u2014she collects her used boarding passes, old concert tickets, disconnected wristbands. It doesn\u2019t escape her notice that she can\u2019t throw anything away, that objects remain unopened, unresolved, untangled, unconsumed. She is always in the middle. She is never at the end of anything.\n\nShe lives near a hospital. All night, she hears sirens, imagines the people being transported to and fro, their bodies speeding along in the back of ambulances and their spirit trying to catch up. She makes jokes. \u201cIf I wake up, someone better be dying,\u201d she says, until one night she wakes up and feels it: someone\u2019s essence slipping past her on the way to somewhere else. After that, she thinks about the hospital as a metaphor, and considers the many ailments the metaphorical hospital could cure, the many symptoms it could treat: Imposter syndrome. Cabin fever. Foot-in-mouth disease. Word vomit.\n\nShe invites her friends\u2014that is to say, her family\u2014over for dinner. She has this one friend whose dad was really obsessed with blood\u2014blood as in family, not the interesting kind of blood\u2014and how it was thicker than water (ew), and then one day her friend looked up the actual expression and it was, The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Shit, right? Anyway, she makes a green bean casserole, which is demolished in short order, and hot rolls. Someone kills a pint of ice cream she\u2019s been saving. Someone else drinks a beer so hard it sputters, erupts. Someone else sits in the corner playing cat\u2019s cradle, waiting to feel the guilt lift from their sternum.\n\nAfter that, the coven of her covenant goes out beneath the new moon; they journal and play Bright Eyes and Britney Spears and act out Mar\u00eda Irene Forn\u00e9s\u2019 plays and eat peaches. They lie on the grass and the stone and talk about the skies they were born under. They don\u2019t believe, really, that it makes a difference, but it\u2019s nice to think about. After all, everyone knows the world is ending. They\u2019ve been told as much, and they can see it in the streets, and they know the world is irreparably fucked, but most importantly they feel it among themselves; they know this goodness cannot last forever.\n\nShe sits near them. They are together but at the same time they are alone, as we all are. Someone has put a braid into her hair; she\u2019s left toothmarks on someone else. Something moves through the empty house, less the ghost than the breath of the ghost. She tells her friends: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to disappear.\u201d Someone laughs. Then, someone else opens their mouth, and something else climbs out.\n\nCarmen Maria Machado, March 2020", "otherInfo": "VICE's second installment of Noisey Night In, a virtual concert fundraiser to support artists impacted by the pandemic.

But singer-guitarist Art Alexakis isn\u2019t about to start phoning it in now.\n\nAlthough the band hasn\u2019t released a new studio album since 2015\u2019s triumphant Black Is The New Black, Everclear continues to tour actively, in conjunction with a series of past-release anniversary dates and the annual Summerland Tour, which Alexakis created and has been running since 2012, featuring a rotating cast of \u201990s alt rock favorites. And while it\u2019s a virtual surety that no Everclear gig is complete without a rendition of \u201cSanta Monica\u201d and \u201cFather of Mine,\u201d lately the band has found that exploring the full range of past material\u2014especially the \u201cdeep cuts\u201d\u2014not only gives fans a rare treat, it also injects new life into the band\u2019s live dynamic.\n\n\u201cBy mixing it up and digging into the catalogue, it still makes it fun and relevant for us, and I think for the fans as well,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cIt\u2019s still important to play the hits, but by playing those other songs as well, it makes it all seem more vibrant and real. Even though I recorded some of those songs 20 years ago, I haven\u2019t played them in a long time, so it\u2019s like reinventing the wheel. I\u2019m having more fun now than I have in years. I think all of us are.\u201d\n\nFormed by Alexakis in 1991 in Portland, Oregon, Everclear has enjoyed a lengthy career spanning 11 studio releases, numerous videos, thousands of shows and accolades that include a 1998 Grammy nomination. Like a true survivor, Alexakis has soldiered on through multiple lineup changes over the years: During the \u201cclassic\u201d era, the band also included Craig Montoya on Bass and Greg Eklund on drums; the current touring lineup features longtime members Dave French (guitar) and Freddy Herrera (bass), as well as drummer Brian Nolan (also with American Hi-Fi), who has performed with Everclear on multiple past tours.\n\nThis incarnation of the band will hit the road for the 2018 Summerland Tour. As in prior years, Everclear will headline the latest installment of the festival, this time supported by Marcy Playground and Local H, and also featuring a special DJ set Alexakis will contribute, which honors the \u201990s in a refreshingly old-school way.\n\n\u201cThe Summerland Tours are all unique; they all have a different kind of feel to them,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cI think this year will be really cool, because it\u2019s usually guitar-based, but Marcy Playground is more acoustic-based, yet they still rock in their own way. Local H is just two guys, meanwhile, and they\u2019re great, too. So, it\u2019s just a different look at \u201990s alternative this year\u2026different facets of what it\u2019s about. With Everclear, we\u2019re going to play the hits we always play, but we\u2019re also going to mix it up. Every night will be a little different; there\u2019ll be a few surprises every show.\u201d\n\nFor Alexakis and Co., it\u2019s a continuation of a hectic couple of years. Everclear spent May and June of 2017 touring in honor of the 20th anniversary of So Much For The Afterglow, the band\u2019s massively successful sophomore major-label release. The 40-date run was an incredibly emotional and personally satisfying experience for Alexakis, who was able to perform obscure cuts from that time period for the first time in many years. Connecting with fans in that setting also reinforced the lasting impression the album has made.\n\n\u201cThe tour was phenomenal. It left me and the band stunned at how important that record was to so many people, and to be a part of that, both then and now,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cThe legacy of it is still vibrant for so many people. It was great just watching people react when we were playing not just the hits, but deeper songs on that record. I always liked the deeper songs\u2014they were usually my favorite songs\u2014and when the band would play those, it would be really exciting and important for me. That was fun, seeing that reaction, and just talking to people after the show.\u201d\n\nPrior to that, Everclear experienced a career resurgence thanks to 2015\u2019s Black Is The New Black, which not only proved the band could still rock, but also that Everclear remains creatively relevant, decades after their platinum years. As is common for many artists these days, Black didn\u2019t set records for traditional album sales, but the release did see significant streaming activity and sparked a heightened social media presence, putting the group firmly back in the listening public\u2019s mind. The band continues to ride this latest wave of interest.\n\n\u201cI personally think [Black] is one of the best records Everclear has ever made,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIt sounds like both old Everclear and new Everclear: It has a contemporary production sound, but it\u2019s just old-school, angry rock songs. It\u2019s kind of dark, very reminiscent of the early stuff. The sales weren\u2019t great on it, but a lot of people streamed it. It got millions and millions of streams, so people were listening to it, and it resonated.\u201d\n\nBut when you\u2019ve been a prolific band for more than a quarter-century, it\u2019s all part of the journey. Right now, Alexakis is feeling a reflective pull for the 25th anniversary of World Of Noise, the band\u2019s indie debut, which was recorded for $400 in a friend\u2019s basement in Portland. Although no official commemorative tour dates are confirmed as of this writing, Alexakis says he\u2019s considering playing some smaller, select shows this year as a tribute to the release. Much of the material rarely sees the light of day, but the 1993 album continues to enjoy a special place in Everclear history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just had a baby, I was on public assistance and was working part-time jobs, I was very frustrated and very angry and there were a lot of emotions going on,\u201d Alexakis reflects. \u201cI made that record for $400, because that\u2019s all I had. I got this guy who had a basement studio to give me 40 hours\u2019 worth of recording at $10 an hour. We had 10 or 11 songs, so we went in and recorded them in a week and mixed them, and that\u2019s the album.\u2026From there we just hit the ground running. I still haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\nThat rough and raw first attempt was just the nexus of the massive body of work Everclear and Alexakis have contributed since that humble beginning. When it comes to recording new material, at the moment Alexakis is focused primarily on writing and recording his first solo album, due out later this year. That precludes a new Everclear release\u2026for now.\n\n\u201cWe might make another record in a couple years,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe later on this year I\u2019ll feel like it. I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nThat said, the band\u2019s live itinerary certainly makes up for its recent studio absence. As the group prepares for another Summerland run, as well as numerous other future dates, Alexakis is excited to revisit songs from fan favorite records like Afterglow, Sparkle and Fade and the double album Songs From The American Movie, but also compositions from more underrated collections, like 2012\u2019s Invisible Stars.\n\n\u201cThere are people asking for songs, so we\u2019ll just try and learn songs as we go,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIf we get a lot of response from people to play a certain song, we\u2019re going to learn it and go on the road and play it. You don\u2019t think, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t sing that high anymore.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to worry about it. We\u2019re going to play some rock n\u2019 roll, and just do it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join Art Alexakis of Everclear for a special solo performance in partnership with the Sweet Relief Concert Series next Thursday, May 28th at 6pm PST.

A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008. Features tracks with Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Saigon, amongst others.", "otherInfo": "Live on The Roots Youtube"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Simple Parade LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7416385.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Folk, Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "At it's core, The Simple Parade is singer/songwriter Justin Hooper who lives in beautiful Denver, CO.

These are melodies of depth, and her guitar work is exemplary.\" - Robert K. Oermann, Music Row Magazine\n\nOnce a Seattle resident, Treva Blomquist is now a Nashville local and has quickly risen to the top of an endless pool of talent that inundates the music city. Treva's ability to seamlessly weave a tapestry of folk and soul, dye it indigo blue, and adorn it with the occasional sparkling sequin of pop has earned her considerable recognition among artists and critics alike. Her songwriting is rock solid and mature, often earning favorable comparisons to Patty Griffin and Mindy Smith, with the exception that Treva is more versatile than either of the aforementioned tunesmiths. Treva is comfortable and compelling performing as a solo act, in front of a small string section, or shaking the walls of any rock venue in town with a band.\n\nAlthough Treva's brilliant songwriting and impressive guitar chops distinguish her from other artists in her genre, it is her voice that places her in a league of her own. Treva's range is wide and her timbre is as focused and as pure as a trumpet, and just as powerful. But it is the integrity and authenticity embedded within her lyrics, and the passion and soul conveyed through her voice that are truly the most inspiring. Treva posses a rare talent that is often sought after but rarely obtained.\n\nBlomquist\u2019s new album Snakes & Saints makes that point perfectly clear. Produced and engineered by multi-instrumentalists Nathan Johnson (Meaning Machine) and J. Brandon Owens (Enjoyer) at both Owens\u2019 Silent Planet studios and Johnson\u2019s home studio, it offers another example of how Blomquist culls her inspiration and sustains her intents through a resilient sense of hope, purpose and affirmation.\n\nConsisting of all original material penned by Blomquist herself, the album finds her sharing her heartfelt vocals through a delivery that\u2019s both hushed and heroic, upbeat and yet unassuming. On songs such as \u201cSecret\u201d and \u201cShape I\u2019m In,\u201d her singing literally seems to shimmer and shine. \u201cSugar\u201d finds her delivery teeming with pure pop perfection.

If you ask the two remaining members of The Tragic Radicals, apparently several. A four year revolving door of band members has brought guitarist, Aj Caves, and former TR bassist, turned drummer extraordinaire, Tyler Chittick, to one conclusion; less really is more.\nRewind to the chilly month of January, 2016 in Fullerton, CA: The rock band soon to be known as The Tragic Radicals was born. Since the recent disbanding of her all-girl rock group, The Slivers, Aj, bored and bandless, turned to Craigslist, to scout out musicians for her next (and hopefully more successful) band. With a little diligence, it wasn\u2019t too long before drummer, Nathan, bassist, Tyler, and singer, Cassidy, were assembled, auditioning in Aj\u2019s living room. The band began rehearsing there weekly, and the four-piece picked up and put their scent on, roughly, a dozen of Aj\u2019s existing songs, came up with a suitable moniker, and were hitting stages within a couple of months. Over the next few years, the group played steady gigs, recorded two EPs (one unreleased), and also underwent numerous personnel changes.\nFast forward to late August, 2019: Two singers, four drummers, and nearly one hundred shows later, The Radicals found themselves tragically (or not so tragically) half the band they used to be. Having recently become a three-piece after letting go of their second (and last) singer in June 2019, the band was surprised to see their summer filling up very fast. The new formation of TR soon was gaining momentum as an instrumental act, and was booked solid through the end of August. Promoters were all over them. They were playing venues anywhere from the Sunset Strip to Long Beach, to Orange County, an exciting and unexpected turn of events for a band who was fully anticipating a struggle booking gigs without a vocalist. In a matter of six weeks, with nearly a dozen shows down, the band was nearing the end of their stretch, with only two left on the calendar, both of which at The World Famous Doll Hut in Anaheim, CA. The first of the two shows was one they\u2019d been preparing for. A Saturday night prime slot with a stacked bill, this was an excellent opportunity for The Tragic Radicals to earn some decent exposure, as it promised a great turnout. They did not predict the departure of their drummer on the day of the gig.\nThough blindsided and disappointed, indeed, the show must go on. No stranger to flakey musicians, the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was setting in for the two longest running members of The Tragic Radicals as they had hours to prepare for their performance as a duo. This was not the first time Aj and Tyler had been forced to curb their act on short notice. If one thing has remained constant in TR, it\u2019s etiquette, and there would be no backing out of shows due to the lack of professionalism from other members. Put on the spot, the two would naturally resort to just guitar and bass, jokingly dubbing these modified performances as their \u2018Almost Acoustic Christmas\u2019 shows; for whatever reason, this seemed to happen every December, coincidentally. Even though this was far from their first rodeo, it was clear they began to silently doubt their abilities matching the caliber of the lineup that night, fearing the intensity of their sound would suffer without drums. Consultation between the two was unnecessary as Tyler posed the idea of ditching the bass, and instead doing drums and guitar, and without debate, the musical arrangement was settled.\nWith a packed house, surrounded by many semi-famous musicians, the nervous pair took the stage at The Doll Hut that night, hoping to make it through their set semi-painlessly. The crowd\u2019s growing audible response as each new song was playedLittle did it would prove to be the most successful incarnation of The Tragic Radicals yet. In the months following their impressive, pivotal August performance, The Tragic Radicals would have a new look, a new sound, and a new following. Not to mention, new opportunities. In a very short amount of time, they found their calendar packed once again, filled with not only gigs, but appearances on podcasts like Taxi TV, The Flabby Hoffman Radio Show, Die Laughing Records Radio Podcast, and C4OC\u2019s House of Metal Radio Show. Somehow, they\u2019d managed to achieve more in a matter of weeks than they had as a full band in almost four years-time. It was an exciting time for TR, and finally they began reaping the benefits after years of hard work.\nAnd so it goes, with success comes some criticism. Now and again, skeptics who can\u2019t seem to wrap their heads around how a two-piece, instrumental band, with no vocals or bass will argue that TR cannot compete with the live sound capabilities of a traditional four or five-piece rock band. Aware of the criticism, the pair has had much to prove when it comes to their live act. Eliminating the vocals and bass does present some challenges, but the two-piece is adapting quite well, crafting clever songs with shortened or modified arrangements to make up for the sounds of absent band members. For years Tyler and Aj were frustrated with TR\u2019s inability to expand their song catalog. Due to the constant rotation of members, it was nearly impossible to write new material at the desired pace. Relieved of aforementioned obstacles, The Tragic Radicals are rapidly writing new songs, and are preparing to record and release new music by January 2020. The creative process requires a slightly different approach now, but Aj\u2019s melodic riffs and ability uniquely arrange songs to replace lyrics is a major asset to the band. Playing through both guitar and bass amps on stage, she maintains her distinct guitar tone while incorporating low end to fill the void of Tyler\u2019s missing bass. Perfectly accompaniment, Tyler lends emphasis to accents and dynamics, drumming as though he was playing bass. An incredibly versatile musician, capable of mastering numerous instruments, his skills and flexibility allow him to keep up with Aj\u2019s frequent song reworking and tendency to experiment with time changes. The two manage to captivate audiences with, not only their blatant chemistry, but their genuine, intense stage presence, and roll with the punches charm.", "otherInfo": "Every Thursday We'll Be Playing 3 Original Tracks - Personal Faves, And Requests Welcomed!

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jerry Joseph LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7249633.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Rock And Roll, Folk, Songwriter, Singer, Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Joseph is a prolific and accomplished songwriter, writing hits for Widespread Panic and releasing 30 albums in his 30+ year career; as a solo artist, with the Jackmormons, supergroup Stockholm Syndrome, his burning two-piece The Denmark Veseys, or originally, with his beloved 80s cult band, Little Women.\n\nJoseph is also a relentless live performer, playing over 150 shows a year across the globe.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lisa Marshall LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10340169.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Classic Soul, Jam, Funk, Folk Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Soul-a-licious, folk-funk dusted with Rhythm and Blues is the music of Lisa Marshall.\n\"She's the little lady w/ the BIG voice!

A true honor for Lisa with her deep love and passion for the women of early Soul/R&B and Blues.\n\nThe band's live performance is an ever evolving sound of folk/funk, garage R&B jam, and improv, taking the songs and the audience on a unique journey every performance.\n\u201cThe cocktail that is her music (a funky, soulful blues) can\u2019t really be called fusion, but more a stirred Motown mixer.

Pruitt on Bass, Track 3 & 4; Eric Manegold on Drums, Track 2 & 5; Kevin Fallon on Lead Guitar, Track 5; Nick Salzetti on Drums. The title track Simple drums were recorded with a single sennheiser dynamic microphone placed in the middle of the drum set above the kick drum.\n\nBorn and raised in Virginia Beach, VA, she spent her early years on the Chesapeake Bay. Her young parents possessed a large vinyl collection; Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Motown, Funk to Disco, was a constant in the house. Lisa remembers hours of sitting on the sand filled carpet with the album insert of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young 4 Way Street, reading the lyrics and singing along to 'Cowgirl In The Sand' with her younger sister. \"I have always loved harmonies. I loved that album for their harmonies. Looking back it's so fitting that I would sing that song. Living literally across the street from the beach our carpet sounded like a giant bean bag when you walked on it. I guess I thought I was the cowgirl.\" (laughs)...more like a gypsy\"\n\nAt the age of 21, Marshall moved to California. It was in L.A. where she co-founded and fronted Peculiar Boogie with Rebekah Coltman (guitar) & Susan Joyner (keys) for a decade. Their band was a unique blend of female fronted \u201cBrit\u201d Rock featuring R&B style vocals and harmonies. The band played and showcased at some of L.A\u2019s hot spots such as Troubadour, and the Roxy. Robben Ford, Koko Taylor, and Big Brother and the Holding Company are some of the acts that Peculiar Boogie supported. The band received air play in California and Europe regularly. Lisa also had the honor of singing with Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\nCurrently Lisa had been debuting new songs with her band live around Austin. She continues to create new music for an upcoming EP to be released in 2016. Lisa has been selected from over 900 musicians in Austin to the list of Black Fret/Patrons of Live Music.

She\u2019s dedicated the lively confessional \u201cto all who wander.\u201d\n\nFrom the album\u2019s torrid opener, \u201cLove Revolution,\u201d to the euphoric closer \u201cSong Don\u2019t Fail Me Now,\u201d The Walk demonstrates a heartfelt testament that music can absolutely heal the spirit. It\u2019s a fearless, funny, insightful Bishop we encounter on a path that found her moving from Nashville back to her native Texas, writing an album that captures a seasoned singer/songwriter rediscovering her passion and musical purpose. It\u2019s a liberating collection of songs she calls her \u201cbreakaway.\u201d \u201cThe words are from my soul and the music keeps my feet moving,\u201d says Bonnie. \u201cFor that I am most grateful.\u201d\n\nFraming each of the album\u2019s songs in one-word definitions (such as PURPOSE for \u201cLove Revolution,\u201d and DOUBT for the moving title track), Bonnie captures life\u2019s contradictions and conflicts with an unblinking, no-holding-back approach. Jordan\u2019s groove-laden production completes the compact she made with herself to flourish outside of her comfort zone. \u201cI always wanted to work with him,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew he was perfect for this project because I knew he would create lively beats that made deeper songs like this connect on an upbeat level, as well. I was taking a journey into the unknown and he was there with me every step of the way.\u201d\n\nBishop began playing original music in dive bars and honky-tonks across her native Texas after graduating from the University of Texas with a degree in Sociology. She moved to Nashville in 2008, sharpening her songwriting chops with writers Mike Reid, Jimmy Wallace, Al Anderson among others. Her big break came when Bonnie Raitt recorded a song she and Anderson wrote entitled \u201cNot Cause I Wanted To,\u201d helping snag a Grammy for Best Americana Album in 2013. In all, Bishop has recorded eight albums, rising though the country/Americana ranks and receiving various awards for her songwriting. A few years ago she decided to take a hiatus from the stress of the music business and enrolled in Sewanee University of the South, where she is currently working toward a master\u2019s degree in creative writing.\n\nIn 2016, Thirty Tigers convinced her to record a new album with producer David Cobb, the universally acclaimed Ain\u2019t Who I Was, which brought her back with a splash and showcased the more soulful side of the dynamic singer.\n\nBonnie also dedicates herself to a cause that \u201cwalks the walk\u201d when it comes to turning music into redemptive, life-changing transformation for others, and calls her work with Songwriting With Soldiers the most fulfilling part of her life as a songwriter. This non-profit organization pairs professional songwriters with veterans and active duty military, using collaborative songwriting to build creativity, connections, and strengths. Bonnie recently performed some of the songs she has written with veterans as part of a Songwriting With Soldiers PBS concert at Nashville\u2019s War Memorial Auditorium, which aired this Fall and continues to run on U.S. public access.\n\nTrack List:\nLove Revolution (written by Bonnie Bishop and Gabe Dixon)\nKeep On Movin (written by Bonnie Bishop and Gabe Dixon)\nThe Walk (written by Bonnie Bishop and Emery Dobyns)\nEvery Happiness Under The Sun (written by Bonnie Bishop and Rebecca Lynn Howard)\nI Don\u2019t Like To Be Alone (written by Bonnie Bishop)\nWomen At The Well (written by Bonnie Bishop and Rebecca Lynn Howard)\nSong Don\u2019t Fail Me Now (written by Bonnie Bishop and Gabe Dixon)\n\n\nFollow Bonnie Bishop here:\nOffiicial Website: www.bonniebishop.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/bonniebishop\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/bonniebishopforrockstar\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/BonnieBishopOfficial", "otherInfo": "Bonnie Bishop will perform a LIMITED LIVE & LIVE STREAM Band Show at Lava Cantina on THURS, May 28th at 9:00pm!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Maggie Rose ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388859.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country, Americana, Funk, Rock, Soul, R&b", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Exceptionally versatile singer-songwriter Maggie Rose released her highly anticipated album, Change The Whole Thing, September 21, 2018. Stamped with her affinity for finely crafted melodies and intricate storytelling, the project encompasses a blend of American music melding Rock, Soul, Rhythm and Blues, Country and Gospel. Maggie's recent album Change The Whole Thing was named by Rolling Stone as one of the \"Best Albums of 2018.\"\n\nThe resilient powerhouse recorded this album at the famed Starstruck Studios in Nashville, TN implementing an impressively demanding method highlighting an artist in complete command of her ever-evolving creative process: live with her 13-piece \u201cfamily band\u201d in one take, no overdubs, no bullshit and a sound that is best described by the following quote from Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cMaggie Rose has come into her own with this current earth-conscious, trippy country-soul stage of her ever-evolving musical persona...Rose\u2019s performances [during CMA Fest and Bonnaroo] showed her embracing her inner soul diva, belting with fire on \u2018It's You\u2019 and the pulverizing \u2018Pull You Through.\u2019 Just to drive the point home, Rose and her band even stretched out on a swinging cover of \u2018The Letter,\u2019 doing a more-than-respectable impression of the funky Mad Dogs & Englishmen arrangement originally sung by Joe Cocker.\u201d\n\nLeading to the Fall album launch, Rose incrementally released four Digital 45s from her forthcoming project beginning in October 2017 to both satisfy and build the anticipation of her growing fanbase. The initial 45 earned her a spot in the Top 10 on Sirius XM with the \u201csmoldering\u201d A-side, \u201cPull You Through.\u201d The \u201cpulverizing\u201d single was hailed by Rolling Stone as a \u201csoulful ballad that rejoices in the healing powers of love...a bare-bones track [that is] really a showcase for the Dusty Springfield-worthy vocals of Rose\u2026\u201d.\n\nIn Spring of 2018, Maggie released \"It's You\" and \"Smooth.\" Rolling Stone once again praised Maggie Rose with \"It's You\" as \u201ca giant, throwback Soul ballad that shows off her dynamic vocals [containing] shades of Aretha Franklin,\u201d and also praised \"Smooth\" as \"a supremely funky rocker with hints of Grace Potter [and] Janis Joplin\".\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding each Digital 45 release has continually increased the appetite of her fans while relentlessly expanding her following via radio, streaming platforms and through her captivating live performances. The full-length album will feature 12 songs, 12 live in-studio videos, with a full-access behind-the-scenes one-hour musical documentary which peels back the layers and allows the viewer an intimate look into the making of the album.\n\nRose has been named to YouTube\u2019s Emerging Artist and Artist in Residence 2018 programs, and Pandora named her an Artist to Watch 2018. In June, Maggie\u2019s creative breadth and versatility sparked the first-ever partnership between Prescription Songs and Sea Gayle Music, with the two companies signing a joint-venture publishing agreement with Rose. In July, she was tapped for an as-named synchronization deal that lends her voice to a national ad campaign focusing on Women\u2019s Empowerment.\n\nIn 2018, Maggie Rose has played over 150 dates across the world including\nBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, while sharing the stage with artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Julia Michaels, Brandy Clark, and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead.", "otherInfo": "Join us LIVE on Thursday May 28th at 9pm CT for the Official \u201cHELP MYSELF\u201d Virtual Release Party, Song Premiere and Concert.

His songs tell heartfelt stories about real people, and are unfailingly optimistic and forward looking. In addition to being a Billboard Top 10 recording artist, he is also the winner of Best Americana Artist by the Indie Music Channel, and two Grammy certificates, awarded in 2017. He performs frequently in southern Appalachia: Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia - however he has performed everywhere from the Troubadour in Los Angeles to Carnegie Hall in New York, and most places in between. He has also played in Europe, including a recent tour in northern Italy. Equally at home as a solo artist and with his Nashville band, Grant is an engaging performer who delights audiences with his southern humor and passion.\n\nHis most recent album \"Dust Bowl - American Stories\" spent 17 weeks on the Billboard charts, including eleven weeks in the TOP 10 of the Americana/Folk Album Sales Chart, and reached as high as #12 on the Country Album Sales Chart, and #2 on the Heatseekers Chart (across all genres). The album continues to earn rave reviews, like this one from NO DEPRESSION, the bible of American Roots music: \u201cGrant\u2019s ability to capture the heartland in his music is amazing ... he has written A heartland masterpiece ... lyrics and music as potent as Woody Guthrie ... sent chills down my spine ... bound to become a classic ... A reminder of the darker period of Bob Dylan, and it\u2019s that good, that memorable...\u201d\n\nIn 2018 his charming Christmas song \u201cFly Possum Fly\u201d (featuring county singing sensation EmiSunshine) was both a radio single and a children\u2019s book. Grant added book festivals and book signings to his itinerary, which continues now as a second book in the series will be published August 2019. His next single, \u201cMan Of Steel\u201d has been selected by the National Veterans Foundation (www.nvf.org) as their official theme song.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Robbie G ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10061735.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Indie, Canadian, Underground Rap", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There is something to be said of an artist with over seven hundred live shows under his belt in the last decade, half of which were headlining slots.

Catching his break after winning a Beatport remix contest in 2012 with his dubstep-\nfocused version of Above & Beyond\u2019s \u201cYou Got to Go\u201d, Seven Lions, born Jeff Montalvo, garnered early support\nfrom the likes of Skrillex and his OWSLA label. 2013 tour dates with Porter Robinson and Krewella pushed\nMontalvo and his genre-bending production style to the forefront of the modern electronic music scene.\nPutting sheer technical production prowess to work in soulful, deep, hybridized creations all distinctly his\nown, the multi-talented musician is single-handedly changing the sonic landscape for future generations to come\nby bridging the gap between the soaring, ethereal vibe of trance and intensely adrenalizing bass music. His\nproductions have seen stages at world-renowned festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival\n(New York and Las Vegas), Electric Forrest, Electric Zoo, South by Southwest, and HARD.\nAfter several successful releases under the OWSLA label (his debut EP, Days to Come, reached #2 on\nthe iTunes Dance charts), Montalvo released his highly anticipated 2014 follow-up EP, Worlds Apart, on Republic\nRecords\u2019 dance imprint Casablanca. Containing several notable features which include Ellie Goulding and Tove\nLo, Worlds Apart debuted at #1 on the iTunes Dance charts, and the title track was also featured in Billboard\u2019s\n\u201cTop 10 Electronic/Dance Songs of 2014\u201d list. The EP also featured the smash hit and canonical dance track\n\u2018Strangers\u2019, featuring superstar vocalist Tove Lo. \u2018Strangers\u2019 was a definitive track in what was perhaps the peak\nof American electronic dance music, and solidified Seven Lions as one of the scene\u2019s premier artists.\nIn 2015, Seven Lions began releasing music in EP formats, devoting each EP to a cohesive idea and\nworld found within the Seven Lions universe. 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Throes of Winter\u201d hints at a larger seasonal theme, to\nbe continued through to his future releases. When asked about the spark for this vision, he explains, \"Since\nartists aren't releasing proper albums anymore, it makes sense to create something that's digitally artistic with real\ncohesion as opposed to tossing out singles and just haphazardly seeing what sticks\u2026 I wanted to start making\nthe music more thematic, interesting, and part of something larger.\u201d\nBucking more trends and breaking from convention, his 2016 Creation EP [Casablanca Records] followed\na different path for his latest body of work. \u201cThis time, songwriting really took place on guitar,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\nare more acoustic elements in the songs, and that ties it together. I wanted to get a little more experimental. I\ndidn\u2019t worry if something was going to be a big banger on the dancefloor or not. I just made what felt right at the\ntime.\u201d Ultimately, Seven Lions continues challenging himself and musical genres. \u201cI want to do something\ndifferent,\u201d he concludes. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to fit into just one genre. I want people to walk away loving\ndifferent kinds of music and sounds.\u201d\nThis year saw Seven Lions once more travel across the country on his There and Back Again club-\nfocused tour, in addition to hallmark festival appearances at Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, EDC\nJapan, Middlelands, Electric Zoo, and Paradiso, amongst others. This summer the sound-sculptor unveiled his\nhighly-anticipated Where I Wont Be Found EP as well, continuing his always growing world, identified via these\nannual EP projects. The eight-track offering is a wondrous journey from start to. From the heavily streamed and\ncritically praised \u201cFreesol,\u201d to the energetic future bass collaboration \u201cRescue Me\u201d with scene upstart Unlike Pluto,\nWhere I Wont Be Found reminds fans of what made Seven Lions who he is today - a singular talent in electronic\nmusic, and a producer who has always forged his own lane.\nIn support of the EP and the year as a whole, Seven Lions will wrap up 2017 with a 20 date North\nAmerican headlining tour with Tritonal (and Kill The Noise as support). Playing some of America\u2019s largest\ntheatres, the Horizon Tour hits LA (2 nights at the iconic Palladium), NYC (Brooklyn\u2019s Hangar), Boston,\nPhiladelphia, San Francisco (Bill Graham), Toronto, and many other key locales.\n\nJeff started 2018 in a new direction \u2013 his very own record label.

He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control. It\u2019s his music, done his way.\n\n( Jon Hartley Fox )", "otherInfo": "Thursday Nights Live (#11)\nTony Furtado/Stephanie Schneiderman w/Laura Veirs.\nFor our 11th episode, we have internationally renowned singer-songwriter Laura Veirs as our musical guest who will swing by for a 'sidewalk serenade'!

These are melodies of depth, and her guitar work is exemplary.\" - Robert K. Oermann, Music Row Magazine\n\nOnce a Seattle resident, Treva Blomquist is now a Nashville local and has quickly risen to the top of an endless pool of talent that inundates the music city. Treva's ability to seamlessly weave a tapestry of folk and soul, dye it indigo blue, and adorn it with the occasional sparkling sequin of pop has earned her considerable recognition among artists and critics alike. Her songwriting is rock solid and mature, often earning favorable comparisons to Patty Griffin and Mindy Smith, with the exception that Treva is more versatile than either of the aforementioned tunesmiths. Treva is comfortable and compelling performing as a solo act, in front of a small string section, or shaking the walls of any rock venue in town with a band.\n\nAlthough Treva's brilliant songwriting and impressive guitar chops distinguish her from other artists in her genre, it is her voice that places her in a league of her own. Treva's range is wide and her timbre is as focused and as pure as a trumpet, and just as powerful. But it is the integrity and authenticity embedded within her lyrics, and the passion and soul conveyed through her voice that are truly the most inspiring. Treva posses a rare talent that is often sought after but rarely obtained.\n\nBlomquist\u2019s new album Snakes & Saints makes that point perfectly clear. Produced and engineered by multi-instrumentalists Nathan Johnson (Meaning Machine) and J. Brandon Owens (Enjoyer) at both Owens\u2019 Silent Planet studios and Johnson\u2019s home studio, it offers another example of how Blomquist culls her inspiration and sustains her intents through a resilient sense of hope, purpose and affirmation.\n\nConsisting of all original material penned by Blomquist herself, the album finds her sharing her heartfelt vocals through a delivery that\u2019s both hushed and heroic, upbeat and yet unassuming. On songs such as \u201cSecret\u201d and \u201cShape I\u2019m In,\u201d her singing literally seems to shimmer and shine. \u201cSugar\u201d finds her delivery teeming with pure pop perfection. The atmospheric ambiance of \u201cAnger\u201d belies the sentiments suggested by the title, just as the mellow drift of \u201cSorry\u201d and the distinctive dynamic of \u201cThe Bottom\u201d reflect a wisdom and endurance that conveys an inherent emotion that\u2019s bound up in each.\n\n\n*Riverbluff Performing Songwriter Grand Prize Winner (2006) for \"I Could Get Used To This\"\n\n*USA Songwriting Competition Honorable Mention (2006) with \"When the Cards Are Yours\" (Folk Category)\n\n*Kerrville Folk Festival Finalist (2005)\n\n*USA Songwriting Competition Honorable Mention (2018) with C'mon Love (Americana)", "otherInfo": "Tune in as Singer-songwriter Treva Blomquist streams an acoustic concert from her home to yours via FaceBook and Instagram."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Becoming Young LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10394287.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Rock, Acoustic, Pop, Electro", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Life's messy, I write songs about it.", "otherInfo": "I'm doing an interview with my buddy Ricky at 7 PM and I'm playing an acoustic set at 8 PM!\n\nVisit this link to watch the stream: https://www.twitch.tv/bassfeedsthesoul\n\nI will also post links on my Instagram @becomingyoung.\n\n//\n\nBecoming Young has a sound that is refreshing enough to keep us wanting more and dark enough to make us look inside ourselves and feel everything.\n\nMaking his RickTalk debut this Thursday Ricky will interview him before he takes over our twitch for the night!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cookie Rabinowitz LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8844817.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Alternative Soul, 4-eyed Soul, Indy, Rnb-soul, Soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Bespectacled Philadelphia soul man specializes in slickly funky pop R&B that harks back to Hall & Oates and the classic Sound of Philadelphia era\". - Dan DeLuca: The best of Philly music, Philadelphia Inquirer", "otherInfo": "Hope everyone is keepin' cool.\n\nCheck back this coming thursday at 9pm sharp to see if Cookie will finally get it right.\nCookie Rabinowitz - Live Stream #6.5\n\n\nkeep in touch, check me out on the links below.\n\nNewsletter: https://cookierabinowitz.com/newslett...\nWebsite: https://www.cookierabinowitz.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cookierabin...\n\n\nDo good things.\n\nThanks,\n\nLove ya,\nCookie"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "OddsLane LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9143646.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Blues, Blues Rock, Blues & Classic Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Odds Lane is a uniquely blended mix of driving blues-rock riffs and solid grooves with an overall pop sensibility.

If you ask the two remaining members of The Tragic Radicals, apparently several. A four year revolving door of band members has brought guitarist, Aj Caves, and former TR bassist, turned drummer extraordinaire, Tyler Chittick, to one conclusion; less really is more.\nRewind to the chilly month of January, 2016 in Fullerton, CA: The rock band soon to be known as The Tragic Radicals was born. Since the recent disbanding of her all-girl rock group, The Slivers, Aj, bored and bandless, turned to Craigslist, to scout out musicians for her next (and hopefully more successful) band. With a little diligence, it wasn\u2019t too long before drummer, Nathan, bassist, Tyler, and singer, Cassidy, were assembled, auditioning in Aj\u2019s living room. The band began rehearsing there weekly, and the four-piece picked up and put their scent on, roughly, a dozen of Aj\u2019s existing songs, came up with a suitable moniker, and were hitting stages within a couple of months. Over the next few years, the group played steady gigs, recorded two EPs (one unreleased), and also underwent numerous personnel changes.\nFast forward to late August, 2019: Two singers, four drummers, and nearly one hundred shows later, The Radicals found themselves tragically (or not so tragically) half the band they used to be. Having recently become a three-piece after letting go of their second (and last) singer in June 2019, the band was surprised to see their summer filling up very fast. The new formation of TR soon was gaining momentum as an instrumental act, and was booked solid through the end of August. Promoters were all over them. They were playing venues anywhere from the Sunset Strip to Long Beach, to Orange County, an exciting and unexpected turn of events for a band who was fully anticipating a struggle booking gigs without a vocalist. In a matter of six weeks, with nearly a dozen shows down, the band was nearing the end of their stretch, with only two left on the calendar, both of which at The World Famous Doll Hut in Anaheim, CA. The first of the two shows was one they\u2019d been preparing for. A Saturday night prime slot with a stacked bill, this was an excellent opportunity for The Tragic Radicals to earn some decent exposure, as it promised a great turnout. They did not predict the departure of their drummer on the day of the gig.\nThough blindsided and disappointed, indeed, the show must go on. No stranger to flakey musicians, the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was setting in for the two longest running members of The Tragic Radicals as they had hours to prepare for their performance as a duo. This was not the first time Aj and Tyler had been forced to curb their act on short notice. If one thing has remained constant in TR, it\u2019s etiquette, and there would be no backing out of shows due to the lack of professionalism from other members. Put on the spot, the two would naturally resort to just guitar and bass, jokingly dubbing these modified performances as their \u2018Almost Acoustic Christmas\u2019 shows; for whatever reason, this seemed to happen every December, coincidentally. Even though this was far from their first rodeo, it was clear they began to silently doubt their abilities matching the caliber of the lineup that night, fearing the intensity of their sound would suffer without drums. Consultation between the two was unnecessary as Tyler posed the idea of ditching the bass, and instead doing drums and guitar, and without debate, the musical arrangement was settled.\nWith a packed house, surrounded by many semi-famous musicians, the nervous pair took the stage at The Doll Hut that night, hoping to make it through their set semi-painlessly. The crowd\u2019s growing audible response as each new song was playedLittle did it would prove to be the most successful incarnation of The Tragic Radicals yet. In the months following their impressive, pivotal August performance, The Tragic Radicals would have a new look, a new sound, and a new following. Not to mention, new opportunities. In a very short amount of time, they found their calendar packed once again, filled with not only gigs, but appearances on podcasts like Taxi TV, The Flabby Hoffman Radio Show, Die Laughing Records Radio Podcast, and C4OC\u2019s House of Metal Radio Show. Somehow, they\u2019d managed to achieve more in a matter of weeks than they had as a full band in almost four years-time. It was an exciting time for TR, and finally they began reaping the benefits after years of hard work.\nAnd so it goes, with success comes some criticism. Now and again, skeptics who can\u2019t seem to wrap their heads around how a two-piece, instrumental band, with no vocals or bass will argue that TR cannot compete with the live sound capabilities of a traditional four or five-piece rock band. Aware of the criticism, the pair has had much to prove when it comes to their live act. Eliminating the vocals and bass does present some challenges, but the two-piece is adapting quite well, crafting clever songs with shortened or modified arrangements to make up for the sounds of absent band members. For years Tyler and Aj were frustrated with TR\u2019s inability to expand their song catalog. Due to the constant rotation of members, it was nearly impossible to write new material at the desired pace. Relieved of aforementioned obstacles, The Tragic Radicals are rapidly writing new songs, and are preparing to record and release new music by January 2020. The creative process requires a slightly different approach now, but Aj\u2019s melodic riffs and ability uniquely arrange songs to replace lyrics is a major asset to the band. Playing through both guitar and bass amps on stage, she maintains her distinct guitar tone while incorporating low end to fill the void of Tyler\u2019s missing bass. Perfectly accompaniment, Tyler lends emphasis to accents and dynamics, drumming as though he was playing bass. An incredibly versatile musician, capable of mastering numerous instruments, his skills and flexibility allow him to keep up with Aj\u2019s frequent song reworking and tendency to experiment with time changes. The two manage to captivate audiences with, not only their blatant chemistry, but their genuine, intense stage presence, and roll with the punches charm.", "otherInfo": "Every Thursday We'll Be Playing 3 Original Tracks - Personal Faves, And Requests Welcomed!

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Z-Trip LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10397331.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electronic, Hip-hop, Soul, Turntablism, House, Producer, Edm, Reggae, Bass, Rock, Funk", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Z-Trip's roots are based in Hip Hop, but he covers and loves all music styles.

With the prolific duo\u2019s meteoric rise a true testament to their hard work in the studio and infectious energy in the club, a slew of early releases via imprints such as Viva, and elrow helped rocket the pair to their first Beatport Number #1 with their breakthrough record on Hot Creations, \u2018Tribesmen\u2019.\n\nHaving later released EPs on Toolroom Records, Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars and Green Velvet\u2019s Relief Records, Solardo soon branched out into their now iconic Sola imprint - which soon became a home for a flurry of the most predominant tech-house tracks on the circuit. With over 50 releases on the label with tracks from the likes of Max Chapman, Mason Maynard, and Grammy nominated duo CamelPhat - who Mark & James worked with on collaborative club track \u2018Accelerator\u2019, the label has gone from strength to strength hosting parties at the BPM Festival, The Warehouse Project and its own club showcase at The Source in Maidstone.\n\nAfter being assigned remixes for the likes of MK, David Guetta, Black Coffee, Nicole Moudaber & Carl Cox, Solardo\u2019s success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and they signed to Ultra Music. Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards.\n\nThe love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK.\n\nMusic aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat.\n\nFollowing on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island.\n\nThe duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair.

He doesn't need an award to prove his popularity and he won't act cool to keep his credibility. The host of Radio 1's ground-breaking Essential Selection show for a staggering eight years, he works within the mainstream, but is respected by the underground.\n\nBorn in Dartford, educated in Rochester and inspired in his teens by the underground soul scene of the late seventies (and the music of the time...by the likes of Funkadelic, James Brown & Evelyn \"Champagne\" King) Pete's first DJ job was at a wedding. He was 15 years old. A natural born entrepreneur, he began promoting local bands, booking gigs in a nearby town hall and - as part of the Kent 'Soul Mafia' - playing black soul & dance music in every club that would give him a gig. After leaving school, he bought a Transit van and set up his own sound system.\n\nIn 1979, Pete became a journalist for monthly magazine Blues & Soul. By the following year, he was features editor, a position he would hold until '83. At the same time, he was appearing on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Medway and London. Then he got his first break with Radio 1, presenting a regular 15 minute 'magazine' feature on dance music on Peter Powell's show. \"That was a strange experience, but also very exciting,\" says Pete. \"Radio 1 was at the peak of its popularity. I had to say what was happening on the streets. I was the first person to play Malcolm McLaren's Buffalo Gals on the radio.\"\n\nPete's knowledge of the dance underground, coupled with his ear for a crossover hit, saw him appointed A&R manager at newly-founded independent label London Records in '83. While looking after the careers of pop acts like '80s girl group Bananarama, he continued to pursue his budding radio career. Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn't pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent's newly-launched Invicta station in '84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers.\n\nIn '88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, FFRR, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. \"The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,\" he recalls. \"I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books.\"\n\nInevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. FFRR's next releases were cut'n'paste production 'Bass (How Low Can You Go?)' by Simon Harris and Salt'n'Pepa's 'Push It', both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve 'Silk' Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L'il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie.\n\nIn '91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country's best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. \"I'm not too concerned with credibility,\" he claims. \"When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn't see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn't want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one.\"\n\nPerhaps Pete's biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of BBC Radio 1. When the nation's biggest radio station decided to re-invent itself in the mid-'90s, controller Matthew Bannister knew precisely who to ask for help. After Pete's ideas were taken on board, the likes of Tim Westwood, Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Carl Cox and, more recently, Fabio and Grooverider, started to appear on Radio 1's DJ roster. In addition, the station's daytime playlist began to reflect the extent of the impact of modern electronic music on British kids. In January '99, Pete enters his eighth year as the presenter of Essential Selection. With over a million and a half listeners each week, it remains the UK's most popular dance music radio show, thanks to its host's consistent ability to change with the times. Its success has also spawned a series of compilation albums, released by FFRR, which to date have sold over 750,000 copies. The latest - which boasts a tangerine-themed cover and the mixing talents of Tong, Paul Oakenfold and, if you're lucky enough to bag a limited edition copy with a bonus CD, Carl Cox - comes complete with Madonna's seal of approval. It is the first time ever that the singer has sanctioned the appearance of one of her songs (Drowned World) on a dance mix compilation.\n\nDuring '98, Pete made his first forays into television, an area he is keen to explore. In November, he donned different guises to present Clublife, a 90-minute, BBC-broadcast documentary based on Mixmag magazine's annual dance awards. However, when he does appear with his own TV programme, it won't be for want of publicity. In the past, he has turned down offers to present Radio 1's high-profile breakfast and Top 40 shows, not to mention Top Of The Pops.\n\nIn the meantime, Pete has plenty on his plate. He is a director of Wise Buddah, the production company which makes radio programmes presented by Danny Rampling, Seb Fontiane and Judge Jules and continues to work in A&R for London Records. His pop star credentials include A&R-ing Shakespeare Sister's hit Stay, which topped the charts for six weeks in '92, and played a big role in signing All Saints, whose career he continues to oversee. He was recently musical director on films, Human Traffic and The Beach.\n\nThe year 2000 proved to be a milestone for Pete - he toured the US for the first time which saw queues around the block, he played on the terrace at Space in Ibiza for the first time, he played in Cape Town and Johannesburg and hosted his own float at Radio 1's 'Love Parade' - \"standing on my float with Jon Carter and Darren Emerson in front of 250,000 Radio 1 listeners was just the best feeling ever - a real moment in history\".\n\n2001 is proving to be an equally exciting year for Pete with another tour of the States starting in March and his first tour of South America scheduled for later in the year.\n\nKeeping his feet on the ground in the UK, Pete continues to be a valuable part of the British club scene with regular gigs scheduled at Tribal Sessions at Sankey Soap in Manchester, Code in Birmingham and many other credible commitments. He still remains a key figure at the UK summer festivals including for the first time a performance at T-In The Park as well as his yearly appointment at Creamfields and Homelands (Foot and mouth permitting).\n\nPete's Radio 1 show \"The Essential Selection\" is now the most listened to radio show on the internet attracting a global audience of over 12 million.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Technasia ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/4618507.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Techno, Electronic", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The outfit Technasia is a collaboration between Amil Khan (manager of the label Technasia) from Hong Kong and Charles Siegling from France.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Robbie G ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10061735.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Indie, Canadian, Underground Rap", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There is something to be said of an artist with over seven hundred live shows under his belt in the last decade, half of which were headlining slots.

Catching his break after winning a Beatport remix contest in 2012 with his dubstep-\nfocused version of Above & Beyond\u2019s \u201cYou Got to Go\u201d, Seven Lions, born Jeff Montalvo, garnered early support\nfrom the likes of Skrillex and his OWSLA label. 2013 tour dates with Porter Robinson and Krewella pushed\nMontalvo and his genre-bending production style to the forefront of the modern electronic music scene.\nPutting sheer technical production prowess to work in soulful, deep, hybridized creations all distinctly his\nown, the multi-talented musician is single-handedly changing the sonic landscape for future generations to come\nby bridging the gap between the soaring, ethereal vibe of trance and intensely adrenalizing bass music. His\nproductions have seen stages at world-renowned festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival\n(New York and Las Vegas), Electric Forrest, Electric Zoo, South by Southwest, and HARD.\nAfter several successful releases under the OWSLA label (his debut EP, Days to Come, reached #2 on\nthe iTunes Dance charts), Montalvo released his highly anticipated 2014 follow-up EP, Worlds Apart, on Republic\nRecords\u2019 dance imprint Casablanca. Containing several notable features which include Ellie Goulding and Tove\nLo, Worlds Apart debuted at #1 on the iTunes Dance charts, and the title track was also featured in Billboard\u2019s\n\u201cTop 10 Electronic/Dance Songs of 2014\u201d list.

I wanted to get a little more experimental. I\ndidn\u2019t worry if something was going to be a big banger on the dancefloor or not. I just made what felt right at the\ntime.\u201d Ultimately, Seven Lions continues challenging himself and musical genres. \u201cI want to do something\ndifferent,\u201d he concludes. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to fit into just one genre. I want people to walk away loving\ndifferent kinds of music and sounds.\u201d\nThis year saw Seven Lions once more travel across the country on his There and Back Again club-\nfocused tour, in addition to hallmark festival appearances at Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, EDC\nJapan, Middlelands, Electric Zoo, and Paradiso, amongst others.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Cecil B.

Incredible Bass Player \u2026 Irresistible Voice... Incomparable Entertainer! The CD \u2018Kane`ohe\u2019 will take you on a musical journey that is Haunting...Refreshing... Powerful and Exciting.\u201d\n\nThe respect of other professionals in the music industry is also evidenced by the fact that Aweau has received numerous nominations and awards for his work, both as a solo artist and as part of a group. His 2001 release E Apo Mai received multiple N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards (Hawaii\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae), including Male Vocalist of the Year and Hawaiian Album of the Year. He also received Song of the Year honors at the Hawai\u2019i Music Awards for the album\u2019s title track.\n\n2005 saw Aweau again honored with multiple awards, as both a solo artist and as part of the group Hapa. His passion for the electric bass was expressed in his Bass Etude CD, which was voted Jazz Album of the Year. And Hapa\u2019s Maui CD, which shot up Billboard\u2019s World Music chart (peaking at number 7), received awards for Album of the Year, Contemporary Album of the Year, Graphics, and Engineering. Aweau was also honored with his second award for Male Vocalist of the Year for his album The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series - Vintage.\n\nIn 2006 Aweau received his third Male Vocalist of the Year award, for his The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series \u2013 Hula CD. In the 39 year history of the N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards, he remains the only artist to receive the honor three times.\n\nIn 2008 Aweau released \u201cKane\u2019ohe\u201d - the long-awaited follow up to \u201cE Apo Mai\u201d \u2013 which was comprised of songs that celebrate the place that he calls home. He wrote all twelve songs, played every instrument, sang all the background parts, and engineered, mixed, and mastered the entire CD.\n\nHis December 2015 release \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is yet another all-original album, filled with songs inspired by his beloved Hawai\u2019i, his first grandchild, Queen Lili\u2019uokalani, and more. As was the case for his other solo releases, \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is 100% Aweau. He sang all the vocals (including background); played all the instruments; wrote and arranged all the songs; and recorded, mixed, and mastered the album, all at his In My Bathroom Studios.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ricky Gene Powell ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ricky Gene Powell's Return of DeadGrass celebrates all eras of the Grateful Dead performed with a bluegrass twist."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anxiety Machine ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "improvised cello and synthesizer music."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ricky Reed ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Garcia Project ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10398789.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Jerry Garcia Band Tribute Band, Jerry Garcia Band Cover Band", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Nationally Touring Jerry Garcia Band Cover Band or Jerry Garcia Band Tribute Band, The Garcia Project\u2019s performances are based on actual set lists performed by The Jerry Garcia Band.

Summoning a thrilling spirit, with throwback sonic crunch, visual flair, and reckless live performances, PALAYE ROYALE has quickly earned a legion of obsessive cult-like loyalists, lovingly dubbed Soldiers of the Royal Council. PALAYE ROYALE draw as much inspiration from cinema and philosophy as they do from their musical muses, building a story with libertine reverence for Alan Watts and debauchery-fueled nights at the Chateau Marmont, for Johnny Thunders and The Stooges. This band is equally at home in the hallways of Los Angeles Fashion Week or climbing the lighting tresses at the Vans Warped Tour. They sold out theaters on their first-ever headlining tour and steal the show at each major festival.\nEach member of PALAYE ROYALE doubles as musician and visionary. The Pirate, The Vampire, and The Gentleman inspire a level of devotion reserved for My Chemical Romance or Twenty One Pilots, as their deep fan connection crosses genre-divides.\nKerrang! declared the band to be \u201con the cusp of next-level stardom\u201d and with good reason. PAYALE ROYALE went from support act on any tour that would have them to the cover of Rock Sound and Alternative Press. \u201cMorning Light,\u201d \u201cMr. Doctor Man,\u201d \u201cGet Higher,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Feel Quite Right,\u201d and \u201cMa Ch\u00e9rie\u201d amassed 30 million YouTube views (and counting). Boom Boom Room (Side A) paved the way for this year\u2019s hotly- anticipated follow-up, Boom Boom Room (Side B), heralded by the arrival of the overnight smash lead single, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Fine.\u201d PALAYE ROYALE brought the juxtaposition of the glitz and grime of their teenage years spent in Las Vegas, when they relocated to Los Angeles in 2011. The ghost of Charlie Chaplin was surely some sort of unseen guide as they took up residence in his old home and rehearsed continuously in a basement. By the time they hit the road, borrowing their mother\u2019s Cadillac Escalade, Remington Leith, Sebastian Danzig, and Emerson Barrett were a tightly wound creative force. (Not long ago, they slept in that SUV outside a Motel 6, unable to afford to rent a room.)\nIt was Alex Burdon, daughter of The Animals singer Eric Burdon, who insisted Sumerian\u2019s founder see the band. (The label offered them a contract the same night.) Los Angeles radio personality and tastemaker Rodney Bingenheimer introduced PALAYE ROYALE to rock industry legend Kim Fowley, another strong supporter. James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins/A Perfect Circle and Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour also count themselves among the band\u2019s true believers, having worked with them as a producer and taken them out on tour, respectively. Sleeping With Sirens\u2019 Kellin Quinn made a guest appearance on Boom Boom Room (Side A). As their moniker itself evokes (Palaye Royale is the name of the Toronto dancehall where their grandparents met in the \u201850s), the brotherly trio is eager to connect themselves and this generation to the spirit of the past, but reinvigorated for today with eclecticism and fierce individuality. Their tours are like a traveling circus. Clad in scarves, hats, paisley shirts, and makeup, as the Soldiers of the Royal Council attest, it\u2019s the PALAYE ROYALE lifestyle. Gretsch guitar tones that shimmer with reverb, drums that shake and pound, vocals that claw forth with the electric urgency of the early punk movement, all swirling together with the swinging cool of the 1960s and the swagger of latter day Brit Pop bands such as The Libertines and early Arctic Monkeys. Each show comes with an element of unpredictability and danger, with the three guys playing as if their lives depended on it, pure showmanship over perfectionism.\nAs Classic Rock Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you want theatrics, these boys deliver in spades \u2013 and not just in their headline-grabbing threads and eye-popping stage show.\u201d The Rolling Stones, The Black Crowes, and The Doors collide with The Ramones and Iggy Pop within their songs, with a hint of the early blues that inspired Led Zeppelin. It\u2019s fast-paced dirty rock n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s glam and grime, spectacle and sweat, showmanship and songwriting. Rock Sound\u2019s in-depth cover story, drawn from an intense 72-hours with the brothers, called PALAYE ROYALE \u201cRock\u2019s Next Superstars,\u201d predicting they \u201cmight just change it all.\u201d Even as 2016\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side A) and 2018\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side B) document the story thus far, PALAYE ROYALE remain focused on the bigger picture. They\u2019ve built something grander than a band. It\u2019s an artistic movement. Ever self- assured in their ambition and staunch in their support of individuality, PALAYE ROYALE are \u201coutfitting the revolution\u201d (as they like to say).", "otherInfo": "Tonight at 9:05pm PT we\u2019ll be celebrating the release of \u201cThe Bastards\u201d with an Instagram Live listening party.\n\nChoose your favorite streaming platform (ex.

The duo\u2019s first EP brought them immediate recognition from their industry peers and the rest they say is history. With an infectious sound that draws on swinging hi hats, low slung synths and masterly crafted basslines, and by joining the dots between the past and the present in their own unique way, Leftwing & Kody have since been back in the Beatport charts with three top 10 records. No wonder Mixmag and DJ Mag ear marked them as ones to watch in 2013 where the guys were also nominated for the \u201cBest Breakthrough DJ\u201d at the Best Of British DJ Mag awards 2014 has seen L&K expand and experiment with their music and has included remixing and working with House music pioneers such as Robert Owens, Todd Terry, Romanthony & Roger Sanchez. With their style touching all the basses between House & Techno I\u2019ts no surprise support has come from the likes of Carl Cox, James Zabiela , MK Coyu, Loco Dice, Booka Shade, Yousef, Steve Lawler, Adam Beyer, Jimmy Edgar and Huxley which shows how broad their production palette is.

With the prolific duo\u2019s meteoric rise a true testament to their hard work in the studio and infectious energy in the club, a slew of early releases via imprints such as Viva, and elrow helped rocket the pair to their first Beatport Number #1 with their breakthrough record on Hot Creations, \u2018Tribesmen\u2019.\n\nHaving later released EPs on Toolroom Records, Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars and Green Velvet\u2019s Relief Records, Solardo soon branched out into their now iconic Sola imprint - which soon became a home for a flurry of the most predominant tech-house tracks on the circuit. With over 50 releases on the label with tracks from the likes of Max Chapman, Mason Maynard, and Grammy nominated duo CamelPhat - who Mark & James worked with on collaborative club track \u2018Accelerator\u2019, the label has gone from strength to strength hosting parties at the BPM Festival, The Warehouse Project and its own club showcase at The Source in Maidstone.\n\nAfter being assigned remixes for the likes of MK, David Guetta, Black Coffee, Nicole Moudaber & Carl Cox, Solardo\u2019s success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and they signed to Ultra Music. Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards.\n\nThe love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK.\n\nMusic aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat.\n\nFollowing on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island.\n\nThe duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair. With all this in mind, Solardo will go into 2020 as one of dance music\u2019s truly premiere names.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Waze & Odyssey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7867632.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Left-field House, House, Tech House", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Waze & Odyssey a.k.a Serge Santiago and Firas Waez, released their first track \u2018Ah Baby (Here We Go Again)\u2019 in early 2012 and have been carving their way through the dance music scene ever since. The now accomplished duo has seen significant chart success alongside some monstrous tour dates along the way. Their overall sound is not confined to their productions; the pair are DJs as much as they are producers. While managing to break down the boundaries between festival life and club intimacy, the enigmatic duo has created a timeless movement seeing them play to crowds at Hideout Festival in Croatia alongside illustrious club appearances at Panorama Bar (Berlin), Bob Beaman (Munich), Showcase (Paris) and Verkript (Amsterdam). Their musical output has been constant throughout their career and has charted their success. With releases on numerous labels such as Edible Records, Circus Recordings, Get Physical, Wolf Music, Dirt Crew, VIVa MUSiC, Elrow, Throne of Blood and their imprint W&O Street Tracks they have nurtured a signature sound that culminates a mixture of old and new elements together. Their use of 808 drum machines, Linn Drums and DMX's alongside their assisted plugins results in a powerful and unique trademark to their records. This style also reflects their DJ sets, where classic and contemporary combine which keeps the crowd grooving, inspired by the pair\u2019s affinity with crate digging which results in the finest of techno and house tracks. This ability to showcase the best of house and techno to the world showcases Serge and Firas\u2019 admirable approach to their DJ sets. Their life on the road continues to introduce the duo to new crowds from all corners of the globe. Highlights include US performances at the Faraway Warehouse parties in Los Angeles and Monarch in San Francisco alongside major European hotspots at Arma (Moscow), fabric (London), Razzmatazz (Barcelona) and The Warehouse Project (Manchester). The duo's sound has even stretched as far as New Zealand, Australia, and Asia with a standout show at Zouk (Singapore) leaving crowds ecstatic by the duo's incredible taste and energy. Along with DJing and production, the duo founded their record label, W&O Street Tracks, in 2012. With an attentive ear for new and upcoming talent, the imprint has grown with them, providing a platform to assist other talented and passionate acts in achieving a similar goal. Acts they have championed on the label include Pedram, Mella Dee, Citizenn, Tapesh, Ejeca, John Tejada, Trikk, New Jack City, Bodhi, Daniel Steinberg, Mediman, Elphinio, XXXY, and Urulu. Serge and Firas have every right to be satisfied with the legacy they will leave on dance music, presenting some of the finest up and coming talent in modern dance music. As they continue to push the boundaries, the pair can take solitude in leaving the scene in a better state than when they found it. With a string of successful remixes for the likes of TEED, Disclosure, Compuphonic, Jodie Abacus, Citizenn and Ejeca, the industry's top names have made no qualms about handling remix duties to the talented pair. This unique combination allows them to gain insight into brand new and exciting music, leaving them very much still at the forefront of their art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Majestic ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8998190.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Majestic", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Majestic (real name Kevin Christie) started out as an MC performing on the North London nightclub circuit at just fifteen years of age. He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece.

He doesn't need an award to prove his popularity and he won't act cool to keep his credibility. The host of Radio 1's ground-breaking Essential Selection show for a staggering eight years, he works within the mainstream, but is respected by the underground.\n\nBorn in Dartford, educated in Rochester and inspired in his teens by the underground soul scene of the late seventies (and the music of the time...by the likes of Funkadelic, James Brown & Evelyn \"Champagne\" King) Pete's first DJ job was at a wedding. He was 15 years old. A natural born entrepreneur, he began promoting local bands, booking gigs in a nearby town hall and - as part of the Kent 'Soul Mafia' - playing black soul & dance music in every club that would give him a gig. After leaving school, he bought a Transit van and set up his own sound system.\n\nIn 1979, Pete became a journalist for monthly magazine Blues & Soul. By the following year, he was features editor, a position he would hold until '83. At the same time, he was appearing on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Medway and London. Then he got his first break with Radio 1, presenting a regular 15 minute 'magazine' feature on dance music on Peter Powell's show. \"That was a strange experience, but also very exciting,\" says Pete. \"Radio 1 was at the peak of its popularity. I had to say what was happening on the streets. I was the first person to play Malcolm McLaren's Buffalo Gals on the radio.\"\n\nPete's knowledge of the dance underground, coupled with his ear for a crossover hit, saw him appointed A&R manager at newly-founded independent label London Records in '83. While looking after the careers of pop acts like '80s girl group Bananarama, he continued to pursue his budding radio career. Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn't pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent's newly-launched Invicta station in '84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers.\n\nIn '88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, FFRR, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. \"The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,\" he recalls. \"I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books.\"\n\nInevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. FFRR's next releases were cut'n'paste production 'Bass (How Low Can You Go?)' by Simon Harris and Salt'n'Pepa's 'Push It', both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve 'Silk' Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L'il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie.\n\nIn '91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country's best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. \"I'm not too concerned with credibility,\" he claims. \"When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn't see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn't want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one.\"\n\nPerhaps Pete's biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of BBC Radio 1. When the nation's biggest radio station decided to re-invent itself in the mid-'90s, controller Matthew Bannister knew precisely who to ask for help. After Pete's ideas were taken on board, the likes of Tim Westwood, Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Carl Cox and, more recently, Fabio and Grooverider, started to appear on Radio 1's DJ roster. In addition, the station's daytime playlist began to reflect the extent of the impact of modern electronic music on British kids. In January '99, Pete enters his eighth year as the presenter of Essential Selection. With over a million and a half listeners each week, it remains the UK's most popular dance music radio show, thanks to its host's consistent ability to change with the times. Its success has also spawned a series of compilation albums, released by FFRR, which to date have sold over 750,000 copies. The latest - which boasts a tangerine-themed cover and the mixing talents of Tong, Paul Oakenfold and, if you're lucky enough to bag a limited edition copy with a bonus CD, Carl Cox - comes complete with Madonna's seal of approval. It is the first time ever that the singer has sanctioned the appearance of one of her songs (Drowned World) on a dance mix compilation.\n\nDuring '98, Pete made his first forays into television, an area he is keen to explore. In November, he donned different guises to present Clublife, a 90-minute, BBC-broadcast documentary based on Mixmag magazine's annual dance awards. However, when he does appear with his own TV programme, it won't be for want of publicity. In the past, he has turned down offers to present Radio 1's high-profile breakfast and Top 40 shows, not to mention Top Of The Pops.\n\nIn the meantime, Pete has plenty on his plate. He is a director of Wise Buddah, the production company which makes radio programmes presented by Danny Rampling, Seb Fontiane and Judge Jules and continues to work in A&R for London Records. His pop star credentials include A&R-ing Shakespeare Sister's hit Stay, which topped the charts for six weeks in '92, and played a big role in signing All Saints, whose career he continues to oversee. He was recently musical director on films, Human Traffic and The Beach.\n\nThe year 2000 proved to be a milestone for Pete - he toured the US for the first time which saw queues around the block, he played on the terrace at Space in Ibiza for the first time, he played in Cape Town and Johannesburg and hosted his own float at Radio 1's 'Love Parade' - \"standing on my float with Jon Carter and Darren Emerson in front of 250,000 Radio 1 listeners was just the best feeling ever - a real moment in history\".\n\n2001 is proving to be an equally exciting year for Pete with another tour of the States starting in March and his first tour of South America scheduled for later in the year.\n\nKeeping his feet on the ground in the UK, Pete continues to be a valuable part of the British club scene with regular gigs scheduled at Tribal Sessions at Sankey Soap in Manchester, Code in Birmingham and many other credible commitments. He still remains a key figure at the UK summer festivals including for the first time a performance at T-In The Park as well as his yearly appointment at Creamfields and Homelands (Foot and mouth permitting).\n\nPete's Radio 1 show \"The Essential Selection\" is now the most listened to radio show on the internet attracting a global audience of over 12 million.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dance System ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9091080.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "House", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWhen Night Slugs boss L-Vis 1990, aka James Connolly, slips on his Dance System alias, the mission is simple: slamming, but pointedly simple and unfussy, tracks that get your ass on the dancefloor.\u201d VICE\n\n\u201cWind \u2018Em Up; four infectious house belters designed specifically with the dancefloor in mind.\u201d FACT\n\n\u201c At the forefront of dance music for over ten years, as one of the UK\u2019s most progressive producers, L-Vis 1990 revives Dance System, following a five-year break, with the playful Wind Em Up EP, offering is a playful take on the serious world of techno.\u201d HYPEBEAST\n\n\u201cSometimes you just want to unleash some slamming house bangers.

Como el buen vino, De La Swing ha madurado con el paso del tiempo y su progresi\u00f3n sonora le ha catapultado hasta poder presumir de compartir tiempo y escenarios con varios de los nombres m\u00e1s importantes de la escena mundial; y es que compartir cabina junto a artistas como Marco Carola, Loco Dice , Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna o Vitalic, o actuar en festivales y eventos tan emblem\u00e1ticos y reputados como Monegros Desert Festival, Eastern Electrics Festival, Kingsday Madness, We are Together, Plages Electroniques, Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival son prueba fehaciente del asentamiento sonoro y arrollador \u00e9xito a escala mundial del madrile\u00f1o. Incorpor\u00e1ndose a la familia Row en 2010 como residente y pilar fundamental de un club como Elrow de Barcelona, la trayectoria de De La Swing ha experimentado un constante crecimiento mejorando exponencialmente y llegando a abanderar, -junto al resto de familia Row-, su residencia tambi\u00e9n en las fiestas especiales a cargo del club catal\u00e1n albergadas en Ibiza como El Row en Privilege Ibiza durante las temporadas 2012 y 2013, o un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde en Space Ibiza.

English version: Born in Madrid in the 80\u2019s, Domingo Bellot starts his musical career at the age of 16. Influenced in its beginnings by techno and drum&bass, his technical skills, ability to connect with the crowd and he\u2019s diverse musical style has made him one of the most versatile DJ\u00b4s in Spain. Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd. While in the studio, De la Swing is a solid and fertile mind being in charge of different labels as Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, having also produced and remixed for labels like Form, Drakos Recordings and Amazing Lab. However, his skills and abilities go further on. We can also enjoy its more underground side with his aka \u2018Smoke Signal\u2019, usually as resident in Ker Club Barcelona once a month, sharing his talent with artists such as Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba or Los Suruba.

Most of his songs are sung in the Italian language; he also released a Spanish-language greatest hits album. His live album includes a short version of the Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\". Jovanotti appears on several international compilations, most notably Red Hot + Rhapsody, a 1998 tribute to George Gershwin, on which he performed \"I Got Rhythm\". Jovanotti has also appeared in one Luciano Pavarotti's charity concert in 1996.\n\nHis most recent CD, Buon Sangue, includes influences from both rock and old school hip hop.

In fact, with seven studio albums and more than 2.3 million Facebook fans, he is one of techno's biggest superstars. In a time where the big drops of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and cake-throwing DJs seem to reign supreme, Paul Kalkbrenner is keeping his cool. He trusts on his remarkable talent as a producer and live act\u2014no added artificial flashiness needed. He can rave with the best of them, and raise his arms to full dancefloor delirium, but his head will never spin right off.\n\nPaul Kalkbrenner's demanding compositions are full of energy; they exist to take listeners away from the everyday, from the weekly grind, into rapture\u2014into art, ecstasy, absurdity friendship, hope and love.\n\nJust 12 years old when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Kalkbrenner watched as East Berlin became an anarchic playground for a previously oppressed generation, recently freed from an overbearing state. Techno music became a way of expression and for many, Paul included, the soundtrack of Germany's reunification. In the autumn of 1992, together with his friend Sascha Funke, he started DJing at local youth clubs. Very quickly Paul and Sascha were either DJing or obsessively collecting records as electronic dance music's first tidal wave spilled over dance floors in Berlin's soon-to-be legendary clubs Tresor, Planet, Walfisch and e-werk.\n\nAt 18, he took a job at German television, spending his days sitting and editing suites watching as staid German political parties held national conferences. This would make him enough money to buy equipment to produce his own tracks. As much fun as DJing was, Paul wanted to play his own music live.\n\nHis first tracks were released on Ellen Allien's newly founded Bpitch Control label in 1999. In contrast to the darker, monotone sounds that characterized techno at the time, Paul's music was more melodic and enriched with a warm, dubby feel. After a number of 12\" singles, Paul realised he was better suited producing albums. In 2000, he released \u2018Superimpose\u2019, followed by \u2018Zeit\u2019 one year later. His third album, \u2018Self\u2019 from 2004, resonated beyond the dancefloor and took the cinematic quality of his music to new heights\u2014an indication of what was to come next.\n\nIn 2004, Berlin-based film director and self-confessed Kalkbrenner fan, Hannes Stoehr, got in touch with Paul. He was planning to make a movie about an electronic musician in Berlin's techno scene and wanted Paul to produce the soundtrack. As the script for the film developed, Hannes suggested Paul might be perfect in the starring role.\n\nTogether with his old friend Sascha Funke, he moved to Aix en Provence for six months. There, far away from Berlin's dreary winter, Paul produced some of his most diverse and mature compositions yet, which would later make up the soundtrack for \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019. He started shooting the movie upon his return to Berlin, with the result being an unconventional but outstanding performance. Somewhere between Paul Kalkbrenner and his character Ickarus, an intimate dialogue developed between actor and audience.\n\n\u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 became a surprise hit, and a German cult movie in its own right. It drew audiences all around Europe and stayed on the big screen at Berlin's Central Kino for several years. The soundtrack went platinum and the single \"Sky and Sand\", featuring his brother Fritz Kalkbrenner's vocals, spent over 121 weeks in the German singles charts\u2014a German record.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Paul split with his longtime label Bpitch Control to form his own independent imprint, Paul Kalkbrenner Musik. A sold-out European tour and a documentary followed. Made with the help of the \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 team, Max Penzel and Hannes Stoehr, \u20182010 - A Live Documentary\u2019 featured an 8-camera shoot of 15 live shows, with computer graphics created by Pfadfinderei (who also worked on \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019). The documentary remains an intimate insight into Paul's life on the road, sprinkled with his dry, deadpan humour.\n\nBetween June 2011 and November 2012 Paul released his fifth and sixth studio albums \u2018Icke Wieder\u2019 and \u2018Guten Tag\u2019. These two self-released albums are Paul's bestselling albums yet\u2014both went top five in his native Germany, with \u2018Guten Tag also topping the charts in Switzerland.\n\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Paul returned to the studio soon after, but this time made a conscious decision to take his time and explore new avenues of his sound. While working on new tracks, flipping samples and experimenting, Germany's Federal Government asked him to play a headlining live show in front of the Brandenburg Gate in a historic ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was another milestone moment in Paul's career. The framed thank-you note he received from the Government afterwards has a special place in his apartment.\n\nAfter 15 years of releasing on independent labels (ten years at Bpitch Control and five on his own label), Paul decided to take the next step and signed a long-term deal with Sony International/Columbia in March 2015. Enthused by this new chapter in his career and incited by the pressure a deal like this is usually accompanied by, Paul went back to his studio to finish his seventh studio album and create a new live show.\n\nThe album, aptly titled \u20187\u2019, was released through Columbia Records in August 2015, and it saw Paul work with vocals for the first time since his chart-topping, record-breaking single \"Sky and Sand\". In an unprecedented move by the label, Sony and Columbia provided him total access to their Legacy vaults, allowing him to incorporate vocals from previously-unsampled music icons Luther Vandross and Jefferson Airplane. The album was a success across Europe, hitting No. 1 on the charts in Austria, Switzerland, and his native Germany; and earning plaudits from the New York Times, Village Voice, Mixmag, and others.\n\nFollowing \u20187\u2019\u2019s success, Paul continued to blaze new milestones, becoming the first techno artist to grace long-running European institution Tomorrowland\u2019s main stage in July 2016. At the end of the day, though, he always comes back to his underground Berlin roots, which he celebrated with his \u201cBack to the Future\u201d mixtape series, a trilogy that chronicles his personal history of electronic music\u2019s arrival to Germany as heard on the radio during his teenage years. The series went viral, amassing over 490K downloads and 502K streams, prompting rumors of a live experience in 2017.", "otherInfo": "Join me this Friday 5pm CET for Studiosession #2.

He maintains this position within the industry with an unrelenting work ethic and a determination to innovate, evolve, and entertain. Whether it\u2019s his involvement with Deep Dish, his solo performances at an extensive list of the world\u2019s most influential clubs and festivals, his dubfire:live HYBRID show, running his label SCI+TEC, or simply his exploration of audio and visual technology, Dubfire is in a class of his own.\n\nBorn in Iran and raised in the U.S. from the age of seven, Ali first developed his skills playing at local clubs in Washington, D.C. He was introduced to Sharam Tayebi through a childhood friend and they formed Deep Dish; a production and DJ duo that conquered the world of electronic music, picking up a Grammy in the process, in addition to a vast array of other awards and accolades. At the height of their success both opted to take a step back and pursue solo careers, with the Dubfire alias allowing him to express his deep love for underground house and techno which formed the backbone of his foray into electronic music. Despite skepticism from certain quarters within the industry, Dubfire quickly integrated himself into the minimalistic techno scene and produced several key releases that cemented him as a true visionary and a force to be reckoned with. From \u2018Ribcage,\u2019 \u2018Emissions\u2019 and \u2018Roadkill,\u2019 to his work with Oliver Huntemann and his remix of \u2018Spastik\u2019 by Plastikman, Dubfire\u2019s creations perfectly display his musical dexterity and depth of aural knowledge. His iconic remix of Radio Slave and Danton Eeeprom\u2019s \u2018Grindhouse\u2019 is considered one of the most enduring and influential markers of his signature sound, as well as a bona fide techno classic.\n\nHis ascent was swift and assured, taking him to the upper echelons of the techno sphere. A fascination with technology and its implementation within both the studio and on stage put Dubfire in a unique position. As someone who performs with an array of equipment, he has advanced the role of the DJ from someone who mixes records, to an individual who manipulates and creates new music on the fly, further blurring the boundaries between DJ and live performer. This ad-lib style leads to a constantly exhilarating, unpredictable show and demonstrates his penchant for technology.\n\nNow splitting his time between Los Angeles, Washington D.C and Barcelona, Dubfire travels on a regular basis, spreading his sound from Brazil to Japan, and everywhere in between. From Warung in Itajai to Womb in Tokyo to DC10 in Ibiza, Dubfire has performed at nearly every club, festival and event worldwide.\n\nNever satisfied with the status quo, Dubfire spent two years crafting a live show; his HYBRID concept has been wowing audiences since its soft launch debut at the Amsterdam Dance Event in 2014. Described by Thump as, \u201cunlike anything we had previously seen or heard before anywhere,\u201d HYBRID reinvents the concert experience by seamlessly weaving together elements of 2D and 3D animation with live audio and lighting to explore the intersection of science and technology - of man and machine - and their resulting evolution and inevitable fusion. After touring 12 different countries in 2015, the critically acclaimed show will touch down at more of the biggest events across the globe including Coachella, Movement and IMS in 2016.\n\nDubfire reunited with Sharam in 2014 to take Deep Dish back on the road for a limited run, cultivating a batch of new material and a scintillating production and visual show to match. As the duo explained to The Miami New Times, \"we\u2019ve come back to together to tell the rest of the story.\" The continuation of this story involves an album project, a comprehensive world tour, as well as an extensive retrospective package of their stellar past work.\n\nDubfire\u2019s story is also set to be told through a documentary; titled \u201cAbove Ground Level\u201d. The film chronicles his career trajectory from fleeing Iran as a youngster to becoming one of the biggest electronic music stars on the planet. Telling a human story of an immigrant in pursuit of the American dream, the film steers clear of past electronic music cliches and gives an in depth look at the hard work and sacrifice needed to become a success within the electronic music scene. Featuring honest contributions from his closest friends and family, along with peers such as David Guetta, Richie Hawtin, Pete Tong, and Carl Cox, it reinforces his stellar achievements and gives an inside look into Dubfire\u2019s journey.\n\nDubfire continues to push the envelope and challenge himself, with 2016 marking a major milestone for the constantly evolving artist who will celebrate a decade as a solo artist. He is set to kick off the North American leg of his dubfire:live HYBRID tour where he will headline a stage at the Coachella Music Festival.\n\n\nCONNECT\ndubfire.com\nFacebook/com/dubfire\nTwitter.com/dubfire\nsoundcloud.com/dubfire\nyoutube.com/dubfiretouring\ninstagram.com/dubfire", "otherInfo": "Tronic turns 25 this year and since we are not able to celebrate with all of you on our scheduled label showcases around the world we invite you to our Virtual Anniversary in collaboration with Beatport."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SALADIN ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10024819.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Future House, Bass House, Tech House, House", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dubbed \u201cChicago\u2019s Ghetto Rockstar\u201d by Iconic Underground Magazine, SALADIN (pronounced Sah-lay-din) is growing at a rapid pace with many releases on prominent dance imprints.\n\nsaladin.mgmt@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Christian Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8486240.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "House, Electronic, Tech-house, Techno", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Swedish citizen, Christian Smith spent the late 80\u2019s years in Germany soaking up the early house and techno sound of Sven Vath.

At sixteen she began performing in bars in Salvador da Bahia and discovered that her calling in life was music. Her passion for Bahian Carnaval led to the ultimate challenge of singing in a trio el\u00e9trico. Mercury took to the rolling, amplified bandstand that lumbers down the avenue among Carnaval revelers at a time in which only men sang in blocos. Since then the festa barroca has become her milieu of choice for redefining her artistry. A performer of exceptional magnetism who emphasizes creativity, responsibility, and social commitment, excellence and originality in her work, Mercury comfortably navigates musical diversity with the infectious energy and joy of being a Baiana. Her tours and concerts around the world have transformed her into an ambassador for Brazilian music. She sold more than 10 million albums wordwide and is one of the best selling female artists in Brazil.\n\nCareer\n\nDaniela Mercury formed the pop group Companhia Clic and recorded her first two albums. Pega que Oh! and Ilha das Bananas became hit singles in the late 80s. Mercury\u2019s first studio efforts paved the way for her incursion into electronic music, placing her at the forefront of what lay ahead.\n\nHer first solo project (1991), released by independent record company Eldorado, announced the arrival of a sound that conquered Brazil. The single Swing da Cor became the most played song on Bahian airwaves. From there it rippled into the rest of the northeastern region and resonated in southern and southeastern Brazil. Today Swing da Cor is synonymous with samba-reggae, a genre rooted in the Afro-blocos of Bahia (dancing groups that act as afro-centric vehicles of racial identity) and directly influenced by the ceremonial drumming used in the African-derived religious rituals of Candombl\u00e9.\n\n\nDaniela Mercury\u2019s first live concert (1992) in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Museum of Art consolidated her popularity onstage. The midday performance attracted more than twenty thousand people who spilled into the avenue, interrupting the flow of traffic.\n\n1992\u2019s Canto da Cidade (Sony) emerged just as Brazil was experiencing the enthrallment of having discovered a new star. The single that gave the album its title became a number one hit and stayed in that position for months. The LP broke sales records, giving Mercury the distinction of being the first artist to receive a diamond record for having sold a million copies. Its success is so impressive that many years have passed since its release, yet Canto da Cidade continues to sell, having already surpassed the three million mark in Brazil and abroad. Canto da Cidade sparked a special on Rede Globo, shows throughout Europe and the United States, magazine covers, and hundreds of interviews. Its success was crowned by shows throughout Brazil boasting a record number of attendants that reached more than two million concertgoers.\n\nMercury\u2019s next album, M\u00fasica de Rua (1994-Sony), proved that the singer was no fleeting sensation. The record established her versatility as a composer and arranger and more frequent domestic and international tours consecrated her as a top-notch performer. Singing in Portuguese for an international audience was not a setback for Mercury. In response to the perceived language barrier she once countered: \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m a Brazilian artist who has less difficulty expressing what I do on an international level. While my audience may not understand what I sing they certainly feel the joy and energy coming from my music and sing along.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Mercury continued to delight audiences with Feij\u00e3o com Arroz (1996-Sony), and won over critics for good. Given her unabated popularity with audiences, skeptics recognized the artist\u2019s musical consistency. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz explored the range of Samba music in its sundry phases, paying homage to Brazil\u2019s musical and ethnic roots with arrangements that showcased the modern pop sensibilities present in the most traditional of rhythms. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz was a landmark album in Mercury\u2019s career, especially in the international market.\n\nFinally in 1998 Mercury released her first live album, El\u00e9trica (Sony), in response to the public\u2019s overwhelming demand of having the electrifying atmosphere of her shows preserved on disc. Recorded in her stronghold, Salvador, Mercury blended the Bahian guitar typically used in the trios el\u00e9tricos during Carnaval with electric rock guitar. The album\u2019s repertoire included hits from previous records, including Swing da Cor, O Canto da Cidade, M\u00fasica de Rua, Rapunzel, Nobre Vagabundo, among others, and songs she had performed live but never recorded. Additionally Mercury included five new songs on the album, four of which were either penned solely by the artist or in partnership with other songwriters.\n\nSol da Liberdade (2000-BMG) reaffirmed Mercury\u2019s affinity for the samba-reggae hybrid. The single Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra registered as one of Mercury\u2019s most beautiful renditions. The artist\u2019s newest challenge, hailed as her best album yet, surprised fans and critics alike. Joining forces with Suba (an acclaimed producer in Brazilian electronica), Mercury mixed the drumbeats of samba-reggae with sounds extracted from electronic music (rap, funk, lounge, house), in a harmonious, if unlikely union.\n\nSou de Qualquer Lugar (2001-BMG) brought together prominent songwriters such as Lenine, Gilberto Gil and Carlinhos Brown and showcased a remake of Rita Lee\u2019s Mutante and an electrifying version of the late Chico Science\u2019s Praieira. Electronic samba-reggae frames the album for the most part, though Mercury\u2019s most intimate and feminine side permeates throughout, from the album art to the compositions and her renditions of the songs.\n\nEletrodom\u00e9stico \u2013 MTV Live (2003-BMG) was recorded during a show at the Castro Alves Theater\u2019s Concha Ac\u00fastica in Salvador and released on CD and DVD. By inviting Portuguese singer Dulce Pontes, flamenco pop sensation Ros\u00e1rio Flores, Italian rapper Lorenzo Jovanotti, Bahian percussionist Carlinhos Brown, along with the bands Olodum, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, and Hip Hop Roots to join her onstage, the show became a high point on the multicultural scale of Mercury\u2019s career.\n\nIn Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico (2004-BMG), Daniela invited the most important DJs and producers of electronic music in Brazil, as well as Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, and Lenine, to participate in a commemorative disc celebrating five years of her having formed TrioTechno, the first trio el\u00e9trico of electronic music to parade in Bahia\u2019s Carnaval. The album is a fusion of a panoply of electronic musical expressions, including Drum\u2019n Bass, House, Techno, Lounge, and Dub with Brazilian rhythms that result in original song creations. The disc subsequently received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a Tim award for best female pop/rock vocals. Internet users voted Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil\u2019s most important weekly magazines Revista Isto \u00c9.\n\nIn 2005 Mercury released Cl\u00e1ssica (Som Livre) on CD and DVD. Recorded from a show she gave the year before at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Casa de Espet\u00e1culo - Bourbon Street the album is a sampler of bossa nova, jazz, and remakes of MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) hits. The recording signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from multinational record companies to gain full control of her music.\n\nThe year 2005 also saw the release of Bal\u00e9 Mulato (EMI). Produced by Mercury, Ramiro Musotto, and Al\u00ea Siqueira, the album is percussive, vibrant, and contemporary. On it Mercury draws from samba-reggae, rock, frevo (a hybrid of martial polka and African rhythms played mostly during Recife Carnaval), galope eletr\u00f4nico (the electronic version of a northeastern rhythm that imitates the gallop of a horse), and romantic ballads.\n\nBaile Barroco (2006-EMI) is the first live DVD of Mercury performing in a trio el\u00e9trico during the 2005 Bahian Carnaval. The collection of songs celebrates twenty years of ax\u00e9-music with quest performers Luis Caldas, Fernanda Porto, Banda Kaleidosc\u00f3pio and Ramiro Musotto. A highlight that exemplified Bahian Carnaval\u2019s history of diversity was when Mercury opened the parade with a baby grand piano set up on an ample stage. Accompanied by Ricardo Castro on piano, Mercury sang Ary Barroso\u2019s Aquarela do Brasil, Villa Lobos\u2019 Bachianas n.5, and some Bach, in a performance that enchanted millions of revelers at the Barra-Ondina circuit and demonstrated the singer\u2019s boldness and inimitability.\n\nPresent\n\noday Mercury has sold more than ten million albums around the globe. She was the only Brazilian artist invited to participate in the recording of a DVD celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Cirque de Soleil. In 2004 she was invited to commemorate the Montreal International Jazz Fesitval\u2019s 25th anniversary and was a special guest on Alejandro Sanz\u2019s latest DVD, with whom she sang a duet in a bullfighting ring in Madrid. Mercury has sung with the greatest names in Brazilian music and in popular music abroad. Legends such as Tom Jobim, Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Paul McCartney and Ray Charles stand out.\n\nThe artistic vitality of Daniela Mercury\u2019s musical trajectory is reflected in the fact that all of her albums have produced national hits and many of her songs have been included in soap opera soundtracks.\n\nToday Mercury is the star of bloco Crocodilo, headlining the Barra-Ondina circuit, which was created as an alternative space in an area in the center of the city that was drawing large crowds during Carnaval. From the time Mercury began parading in 1996 down the Avenue the winds along the seashore, later setting up her own camarote (boxes along the parade route), the circuit became official. Today it attracts hundreds of thousands of revelers in the same way the former Seventh Avenue circuit did in the past.\n\nThe celebration of Carnaval is a backdrop to Mercury\u2019s success on stage and in the studio. For many years she was chosen best Carnaval singer and some of her hits were named best Carnaval themed music, sang by other artists and blocos.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Renato Ratier ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Deep House, Electronic", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tronic turns 25 this year and since we are not able to celebrate with all of you on our scheduled label showcases around the world we invite you to our Virtual Anniversary in collaboration with Beatport."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Resident DJ ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Umek ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6775691.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electronic, Techno", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born in 1976, in Ljubljana, Slovenia, Uro\u0161 Umek began DJing in 1993.

The group was a major component of the young generation of white blues artists\u2014also including Paul Butterfield, Charlie Musselwhite, Harvey Mandel, Barry Goldberg, Nick Gravenites and Michael Bloomfield\u2014who learned the historic Chicago blues style at the feet and hands of such towering figures as Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy and Sam Lay.\n\nCorky played with all these greats at Siegel-Schwall\u2019s first steady engagement, in 1965 at Peppers, Chicago\u2019s internationally renowned blues club. They were soon signed to Vanguard Records, with blues luminary Samuel Charters producing. Their first album, The Siegel-Schwall Band, was released in 1966, and with it the group made San Francisco a virtual second home: There the likes of Janis Joplin, Santana, Steve Miller and Joni Mitchell opened for them (Siegel-Schwall actually produced Mitchell\u2019s demo tape); the band would record three more classic albums for Vanguard up through 1970, then five for Wooden Nickel/RCA through 1974 before going on hiatus.\n\nIn 1973 the band released Three Pieces for Blues Band and Symphony Orchestra on the prestigious classical music label Deutsche Grammophon. The titletrack was an avant-garde piece composed by jazz trombonist William Russo combining classical music played by an orchestra (the San Francisco Symphony) with blues music played by a four-piece band (Siegel-Schwall) conducted by maestro Seiji Ozawa.\n\nOzawa had been a huge fan of Siegel-Schwall since 1966, when he was the first music director of the Ravinia Festival\u2013the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He used to see the band perform frequently at Chicago blues clubs, and suggested a blues-classical collaboration. Corky worked closely with Russo, and in 1968 they premiered Three Pieces for Blues Band and Symphony Orchestra with Ozawa and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; its success\u2014including a high charting Billboard pop and classical single culled from the program\u2013led to Siegel-Schwall\u2019s performance with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra on an Evening At Pops program for PBS, and in 1979, Deutsche Grammophon\u2019s release of Russo\u2019s Street Music, A Blues Concerto, featuring Corky on harmonica and piano, which received the French Government\u2019s Grand Prix du Disque award as well as the Recording of Special Merit in Stereo Review.\n\nAfter releasing three solo albums, Corky founded Corky Siegel\u2019s Chamber Blues, featuring himself on harmonica, piano and vocals, the West End String Quartet of topflight Chicago classical string players, and Frank Donaldson on world percussion instruments. The novel ensemble performed Siegel\u2019s pioneering blues/classical music compositions and released its first album, Corky Siegel\u2019s Chamber Blues, on Chicago\u2019s famed blues label Alligator Records in 1994. The album gained rave notices from publications like Billboard and Stereophile, and has been followed by two more albums.\n\nAdditionally, Corky has written and performed works for the Grant Park Symphony in Chicago (most recently Blues for a Green Planet-Opus 10) and the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center. He composedContinuum with renowned choreographers Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis, and his music has also been choreographed and performed by five international ballet companies and has been used for numerous motion pictures and national TV specials, as well as the Olympic men\u2019s figure skating competition and the World Championship skating competition featuring Olympic gold medalists Torvill and Dean. His recent commission from the Lancaster Symphony Orchestra, The Symphonic Blues Suite, has already been performed many times around the world.\n\nCorky continues to appear internationally as guest soloist with symphony orchestras including the New York Philharmonic, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Orquestra Metropolitana De Lisboa in Portugal, the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal, the NHK Symphony in Japan, and the Philadelphia Orchestra with Maestro Charles Dutoit. He has performed many symphonic collaborations with Doc Severinsen, and also tours frequently with Dr. L. Subramaniam, India\u2019s greatest Eastern classical violin virtuoso: These \u201cglobal fusion\u201d tours have further featured some of the top names in jazz including Ernie Watts and Larry Coryell.\n\nMeanwhile, Corky continues to perform with Siegel-Schwall, which in addition to Schwall and longtime bassist Rollo Radford, includes drummer Sam Lay, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee as a member of the Paul Buttefield Blues Band. He is prominently featured in the acclaimed documentary Born in Chicago, which recounts the history of the \u201860s rock-blues explosion and also stars Bob Dylan, Jack White, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Eric Burdon and Steve Miller, as well as Barry Goldberg, Harvey Mandel and Nick Gravenites; he has recorded and toured with Goldberg, Mandel, Gravenites and Lay as the Chicago Blues Reunion.\n\nIn 2007 Corky published the music guide book Let Your Music Soar: The Emotional Connection, co-written with Peter Krammer. And his harmonica playing accompanies the storytelling of award-winning Mexican American young adult novelist Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan in the audio book version of her 2015 book Echo, a mysterious tale involving a prophecy, a promise and, of course, a harmonica.\n\nby Jim Bessman\n\nhttp://www.chamberblues.com", "otherInfo": "Every Tue & Friday at 11:20 AM in Chicago - Completely home-made live stream in the little home of Corky and Holly.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "Friends, we have good news for you.\nMark your calendars for May 29! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nOfficial announcement:\n\nINSOMNIUM performs a special WINTER\u2019S GATE live stream show\n\nFinland\u2019s spearhead of melodic death metal, Insomnium will play a special worldwide live stream show on Friday, May 29, showtime 19:00 CET.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luis Figueiredo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10394795.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Acoustic, Classical & Jazz, Piano, Producer, Song, Arranger, Classical", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LU\u00cdS FIGUEIREDO was born in Coimbra in 1979.\n\nAfter concluding the Piano program at the Music Conservatory in Coimbra, he graduated in Piano at the University of Aveiro, where he studied with Vitali Dotsenko, Fausto Neves, Ant\u00f3nio Chagas Rosa and others.

Viv\u00ed toda mi infancia, y hasta los 17 a\u00f1os, en la ciudad donde nac\u00ed. All\u00ed hice pre-escolar en el Jard\u00edn Infantil \u201cEl Renacuajo\u201d, primaria en el Liceo V. A. L. (Vida, Amor y Luz) y secundaria en el Colegio San Luis Gonz\u00e1ga, ahora Colegio Champagnat, y luego de graduarme del colegio ingres\u00e9 a la VI Brigada del Ej\u00e9rcito, para cumplir con mi a\u00f1o de servicio militar obligatorio. La m\u00fasica siempre ha orbitado a mi alrededor, incluso desde que estaba en la barriga de mi mam\u00e1, Fabiola, ya que ella es m\u00fasico por convicci\u00f3n, aunque la vida la haya llevado a enfrentar otros retos. Incluso tengo memoria del primer bolero que me aprend\u00ed (Deseo), cuando a\u00fan no hab\u00eda nacido, y que mi mam\u00e1 lo cantaba en mi 8\u00ba mes de gestaci\u00f3n. Soy profesional en Finanzas y Relaciones Internacionales, de la Universidad Externado de Colombia en Bogot\u00e1, con diploma y todo, aunque \u00e9ste repose y acumule capas de polvo en alg\u00fan caj\u00f3n, pero siempre supe que mi destino estaba guiado por canciones. He hecho toda la escuela que un m\u00fasico de la calle puede hacer. He cantado en serenatas, con media de aguardiente Tapa Roja como \u00fanico pago, he cantado en bares de diferentes tama\u00f1os y diversos estilos, he amenizado almuerzos, fiestas de 15 a\u00f1os, bautizos, cap\u00edtulos de novelas, y hasta alg\u00fan velorio, y tuve bar propio cantado canciones ajenas. Fue all\u00ed donde tuve la oportunidad de conocer y perfeccionar el oficio de cantar en vivo, noche tras noche, haciendo de la comunicaci\u00f3n entre el artista y la gente nuestra virtud m\u00e1s relevante. Alguien me dijo alguna vez que la m\u00fasica me hab\u00eda salvado la vida, y estoy de acuerdo. Es lo que mejor se hacer, ya que mi zurda nunca fue prodigiosa con el bal\u00f3n, qu\u00e9 otra cosa quedaba por hacer? Cuando uno es un peque\u00f1\u00edn siempre dice: \u201cQuiero ser futbolista, o m\u00fasico, o Superman\u201d, por suerte le pegu\u00e9 a una de las tres. Las canciones me vienen del alma, y no conozco otra manera de escribir, y quisiera pensar que cuando alguien oye alguna de mis canciones, en un disco, en la radio, o en un concierto, es all\u00ed, al alma, el lugar al cual llegar\u00e1. Y escribo de amor, en todas sus formas, incluido el desamor, su forma m\u00e1s cruel. Mi equipaje para llegar a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d lo componen 2 discos, anteriores, muchos amores y varias traiciones, una visita al infierno, y un auto-descubrimiento de lo que soy. En 2003 sali\u00f3 al mercado \u201cSolo hasta hoy\u201d, con \u201cNo mires atr\u00e1s\u201d y \u201cUna y otra vez\u201d como banderas, y en el 2006 sali\u00f3 \u201cSentidos\u201d, donde fueron \u201cAcabado\u201d y \u201cTus Regalos\u201d las canciones m\u00e1s importantes, comercialmente hablando. \u00c9stos dos cap\u00edtulos musicales me han brindado varios de los momentos m\u00e1s emocionantes de mi vida, siendo el m\u00e1s importante la respuesta de la gente frente a mis canciones, pero tambi\u00e9n me permiti\u00f3 conocer a varios de mis \u00eddolos, y compartir escenario y canciones con ellos, artistas como Alejandro Sanz, Pablo Milan\u00e9s, Miguel Bos\u00e9, Fito P\u00e1ez y Franco de Vita, han salpicado e inspirado con su arte lo que hago, y he tenido la fortuna de abrir sus shows, y en algunos casos cantar hombro a hombro en el escenario. Ahora estamos frente a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d, desde que escrib\u00ed la primera de las 30 canciones que compuse para \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum hasta ahora han pasado 23 meses, muchos \u00e1ngeles, y 2 viajes a Espa\u00f1a, y ha sido un camino maravilloso. Espero que las canciones que seleccionamos les gusten, en palabras de Nacho Ma\u00f1\u00f3, el productor musical de \u00e9ste disco, y mi hermano del alma, \u201ces un disco sincero, personal y sincero, algo cada vez m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de encontrar en \u00e9ste negocio\u201d. \u201cCREO EN SECRETOS, Y EN EL ARTE COMO FORMA DE VIDA, CREO EN QUE TODO SE DEVUELVE, EN EL MISTERIO Y LA AVENTURA.

Heavily influenced by soul greats such as Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin, Knight has released four studio albums and one compilation collection to date. Widely labelled as one of Britain's greatest soul singers, Knight is best known for her hit singles \"Greatest Day\", \"Shoulda Woulda Coulda\" and \"Come As You Are\" and \"Get Up!\". After a decade in the industry, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Urban Music Awards in 2004.\n\nIn 2006 Knight starred in BBC1 music TV show, Just The Two Of Us, and is the host of the Radio 2 show Beverley's Gospel Nights, which explores the origins and impact of gospel music. Now in its second season, the show has featured interviews with stars such as Destiny's Child and Shirley Caesar.\n\nKnight is an ambassador for many charities such Christian Aid and has travelled to areas affected by disease and poverty to help raise awareness. She is an active campaigner for anti-Aids organisations such as the Stop AIDS Campaign and The Terrence Higgins Trust and is also a vocal campaigner against homophobic lyrics in urban music. She became an MBE in 2006, the only musician to be granted such an honour in the Queen's eightieth birthday honours list.\n\nIn February 2006 Knight consolidated her move into the mainstream audience by appearing on BBC1 music show, Just The Two of Us. The show, featuring celebrities who duet with established singers, ran for two weeks and proved to be a relative disappointment in terms of audience figures \u2013 averaging between fifteen and twenty-five percent audience shares.[17] Nevertheless it provided a platform for Knight to reach out to a bigger audience and demonstrate her talent by performing a different array of songs than she would otherwise be known for. Reaching out to new audiences was also a driving force behind Knight\u2019s decision to join Take That on their reunion arena tour. Take That - The Ultimate Tour 06, which ran from April to July 2006, sold 270,000 tickets in less than four hours on sale at the box office and featured Knight as a support act.[18]\n\nIn March 2006 Beverley released her fifth album, a compilation set featuring the majority of her top forty UK singles entitled Voice - The Best Of Beverley Knight. The album, which was certified Gold less than a month after its release,[19] became her second highest charting of her career when it entered the UK albums chart at number ten and rose to number nine a month later. It was preceded by the single \"Piece of my Heart\" \u2013 a cover of the Erma Franklin classic made famous by Janis Joplin and entered the singles chart at number sixteen, spending eleven weeks inside the UK top 75 singles chart and becoming her longest-running chart single to date.\n\nIn October 2006, Knight recorded her fifth studio album, Music City Soul, in Nashville. Completed in less than five days, the album was released on 7 May 2007 and features collaborations with musicians such as Ronnie Wood and Scotty Moore. It has spawned three singles thus far, \"No Man's Land\", released on 16 April 2007, \"After You\", released on 2 July 2007 and \"The Queen of Starting Over\", released on 15 October 2007.\n\nBeverley will be releasing her next album in spring 2009", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LP Giobbi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388009.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electro House, Disco, House, Electro Pop, Dance Pop", "Time": "5:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LP Giobbi is rock \u2019n roll with a disco soul, born draped in sequins and cloaked in fog at a seance in the mountains of Oregon.\n\nShe was trained in jazz piano at UC Berkeley before becoming a synth warrior goddess in Los Angeles.

Moved to Austin to attend UT (hook 'em horns). Lived a pretty normal life, bought a house, worked a job, and got married. Then decided to become a singer...and by default, a songwriter. Now with 4 solo albums, a solo EP, two duo covers albums, plenty of guest vocals on other great albums, and a slew of songwriting awards under her belt, BettySoo's life looks pretty different from how it did nine years ago, when she was a newlywed in graduate school (she dropped out to be a musician). BettySoo's shows are ever-changing and entertaining - as much for what is said off the cuff between songs as for the songwriting and her breathtaking delivery. Backed by her band in Austin, Texas (including Will Sexton, Jeff Plankenhorn, Brian Standefer, Todd Wilson, Paul Prestridge, and husband Mail Man Dave Terry), she's garnered her share of great show reviews on top of the critical success her albums have achieved. Her newest album was recorded with her friend and cellist Brian Standefer at his studio in Buda, TX. Featuring 12 original songs that cover heavy material - in a range of styles, from fresh pop to raw grit to lush string and woodwind arrangements, When We're Gone has received high praise across the U.S. A side project, an acoustic duo with Canadian dobro master Doug Cox, has seen plenty of miles in its first year: BettySoo and Doug have played in the States, Canada, England, Scotland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. BettySoo's songwriting awards include: Kerrville New Folk Award, Mountain Stage NewSong Winner, Wildflower! Festival Songwriting Competition Winner, Sisters Folk Festival Songwriting Competition Winner, and Big Top Chautauqua Songwriter of the Year. She has been a featured performer at SXSW, International Folk Alliance, Tin Pan South, Kerrville Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, Vancouver Island Folk Festival, Old Settlers Music Festival, Wilderness Songs Festival (Netherlands), and many revered listening rooms. Her style? There\u2019s a little gospel, some straight-ahead folk, a bit of twang, a bit of pop, and maybe even a familiar oldie with a new twist. If you're planning to see her live, be ready for a surprise. Then again, not much about BettySoo isn\u2019t surprising. People are surprised just to see her take the stage. Plain-faced, petite (clocking in at exactly 5 feet), and freckly, people don\u2019t have any idea what to expect \u2013 they certainly don\u2019t expect such a large voice and moving songs. \u201cI guess Asian-American singer-songwriters aren\u2019t that common,\u201d she comments, \u201cat least, not in Texas.\u201d And, of course, there\u2019s the whole issue of her name. How did a second-generation Korean end up with such a classic southern name? Is it a stage name? \u201cNo,\u201d she answers, laughing, \u201cI guess I\u2019m just lucky that way. It\u2019s right there on my birth certificate. Soo is my dad\u2019s middle name, too. Yep, he\u2019s a boy named Soo.\u201d Grew up in Spring, TX. Lives in Austin. Travels all the time to sing songs.

Derek Warfield is a distinguished name among them. Derek Warfield and They Young Wolfe Tones are bringing that musical tradition forward with a reverence for Ireland\u2019s past and the energy and optimism of a new generation of Irish musicians. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting an old tradition in a new package \u2013 and I\u2019ve the same passion for it now as I had when it all started 50 years ago!\u201d DEREK WARFIELD After spending nearly 40 years as founder/leader of the legendary Wolfe Tones (named after the 18th century Irish Revolutionary Theobald Wolfe Tone), Derek Warfield is revered as a singer, songwriter, historian and entertainer in all parts of the world where Irish roots have been put down. The Wolfe Tones enjoyed phenomenal success with 13 best-selling albums, 3 number one hits, many television appearances and shows in esteemed venues such as New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall and The Royal Albert Hall in London. Since breaking away from the Wolfe Tones in 2001, Derek\u2019s solo career has yielded 11 albums to date, the most successful of them being On the One Road, The Bonnie Blue Flag and Let Ye All be Irish Tonight. With the formation and ongoing success of The Young Wolfe Tones, the legend of Derek Warfield continues. LEGACY \u2013 THE YOUNG WOLFE TONES In 2001, after nearly 40 years performing, the legendary Wolfe Tones parted with their founder and leader \u2013 Derek Warfield. No other Irish folk group, before or since, told the story of Ireland so completely and unapologetically. But for Derek\u2019s hunger and desire to continue to further the story of Ireland through song, an ancient tradition might have lost perhaps its most iconic figure. In 2006 Derek put together a band containing some of the finest musicians and singers in Irish music \u2013 The Young Wolfe Tones. Damaris Woods - Banjo Damaris Woods from Co. Meath and is recognized as one of the foremost banjo players in Irish music. She has made a major contribution in popularizing the banjo within Irish traditional music. Damaris has performed an extremely hectic touring schedule over the last decade across the world. She has appeared on the Irish Spring Tour in Germany and been part of performing groups in North America, Australia and the prestigious Celtic Colours Festival in Cape Briton, Canada. Damaris has appearances on many radio and television shows including Ireland\u2019s The Late Late Show (RT\u00c9). Damaris is also a gifted music and many of her students have been prominent prizewinners in traditional music competitions over the last number of years. On an annual basis Damaris organizes the hugely popular traditional arts camp \u2013 The Ag Seinm Traditional Arts Camp in Co. Cavan, Ireland. Despite her own hectic schedule she still manages to find time to teach at the Joe Mooney Summer School in Drunshambo every year as well as The University of Ulster, Coleraine. Peadar Hickey \u2013 Guitar and Vocals Dublin\u2019s Peadar Hickey has been delivering the songs of Ireland\u2019s history to audiences at home and abroad for over a decade. A regular fixture on the Dublin city folk and traditional music circuit, Peadar learned his trade on stage at The Arlington Hotels, Oliver St John Gogarty\u2019s and The Temple Bar in Dublin\u2019s Cultural Quarter. In 2010, Peadar moved to New York City and now performs mainly on the Irish American circuit, teaming up with notable musicians such as Pio Ryan (banjo), Matt Mancuso (fiddle) and Vonnie Quinn (fiddle). On St Patrick\u2019s Day 2013, Peadar was invited to join All-Ireland winning accordion player Martin O\u2019Connell in a performance at the New York Mayor\u2019s residence \u2013 Gracie Mansion. Peadar is currently an instructor of guitar for traditional Irish accompaniment at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. Dan Lowery \u2013 Flute and Vocals Dan Lowery is one of the top Irish flute players in the United States today. Born in Milwaukee, raised in Dallas, and with ancestry from County Cork, Dan spent his youth travelling to Ireland learning traditional Irish music. A tour with Surreel, a band of up-and-coming American Irish musicians, prompted him to move to New York in 2002, where he has lived for the past ten years playing Irish music full-time. In demand as a flute and whistle player, and also as a guitarist, singer and teacher, he has appeared on stage and recordings with numerous musicians and bands, including Ivan Goff, Damien Connolly, Allison Barber, Johnny Cuomo, Ashley Davis, Darren Maloney, the Trinity Hall Session Players and Idle Road. Dan has been a member of Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2010. Derek Warfield\u2019s 50 years of experience coupled with the talent and energy of The Young Wolfe Tones brings the old tradition of Irish balladry into a new age. The story of Ireland is transmitted in their music and song and illuminated by the outstanding musicianship of three wonderful ambassadors of a new generation of traditional players. Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones deliver Ireland\u2019s traditional music and folk songs with an energy and skill that shows the quality of contemporaries within that tradition. The patriotic spirit of Irish music carried through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s by the Wolfe Tones now marches on in the dynamic sound of The Young Wolfe Tones. SHOWS Irish festivals all over the United States have been host to Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2007. Currently the band plays between 20 and 30 Irish festivals per year all over the country. In addition to musical performances, Derek also delivers lectures on Irish history and the history of the Irish in America. These lectures feature acoustic performances of ballads relevant to the subject matter. Perhaps most notably, the band performed at the great Milwaukee Irish Festival in 2011 - the biggest Irish festival in the world. Pat Byrne from Columbus Ohio, one of the organizing committee at the Dublin Irish Festival in Ohio, had this to say \u201cDerek has always set high standards for his performances and this band raises the bar. The people loved them and gave them an unbelievable rousing and appreciative reception. These Young Wolfe Tones and their legendary leader were given a standing ovation, The Dublin Ohio festival were delighted to have them \u2026 they\u2019re as good as it gets!\u201d Australia was the destination in April of 2011. The band played twelve concerts in two weeks with the highlight being four days performing at the National Folk Festival in Canberra. The same year saw the release of Far Away in Australia \u2013 a CD to coincide with their Australian visit. With 19 tracks the collection is a mixture of classic Irish songs music and literature that connect the two countries. Far Away In Australia fittingly highlights the Irish contributions to Australia in song and music. They perform regularly at the R\u00ed R\u00e1 Irish Pub at Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas and are certainly regarded as a unique stalwart among Las Vegas\u2019 many musical acts. AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND CIVIL WARS Many of the Irish festivals around the United States every year also play host to lectures/musical performances on the songs of the Irish in the American Revolution and Civil War by Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones. Derek deals with ballads of regret, joy, victory and defeat and clearly illustrates Ireland's hand in defending the ideals that the United States was founded on. The lecture/show has been an eye-opener for many folk and history enthusiasts from Ireland and America alike. The response and feedback throughout the festival circuit here has been wonderful and has added such a wide and important aspect to the legacy of Derek Warfield and his part in the history of Irish balladry. It is a rich legacy that was almost entirely neglected before Derek began putting together Sons of Erin, Bonnie Blue Flag, Faugh-a-Ballagh and Washington's Irish \u2014 four albums dealing with the Irish of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. He has also written a book, The Irish Songster of the American Civil War. He comments: \u201cLooking at the tremendous quality of the songwriting among the Irish over generations in the States, as recorded in libraries and collections across the country, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that Ireland lost its greatest talent in those times, particularly in those who starved or emigrated during the Famine years.\u201d \u201cI hope it helps to keep alive the memory of the many Irishmen who fought on both sides,\u201d he says. Derek Warfield\u2019s lifelong passion for engaging people in the music and story of Ireland is also very present in the other band members: \u201cCommunication with a live audience through music is what I believed to be of primary importance when I founded the Wolfe Tones in 1963. In performing with The Young Wolfe Tones, I continue to communicate with audiences while also passing on an important tradition to a new generation. But perhaps most importantly, it has been fun and enjoyable and every performance gets better. The experience has reinvigorated me and given the young players and singers the opportunity to display their skills and talents around the world\u201d www.theyoungwolfetones.com www.facebook.com/theyoungwolfetones www.irishworldradio.com DISCOGRAPHY Legacy Faugh-a-Ballagh (Clear The Way) Bonnie Blue Flag Sons Of Erin Liberte 98 Sl\u00e1n Abhaile A Nation Once Again God Save Ireland Green White & Essential Gold Volume 2 (2 CD Set) Green White & Essential Gold Volume 1 (2 CD Set) The Night Is....Young On The One Road Far Away In Australia On The One Road Let Ye All Be Irish Tonight (Available from www.theyoungwolfetones.com) Fifty years on from his debut performance, Warfield is now delighted to present the Young Wolfe Tones.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Guordan Banks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371486.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Hip-hop R&b Pop And Soul", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-Songwriter GUORDAN (Pronounced Jour-dan) BANKS has had major success writing songs for artists such as John Legend, Keyshia Cole, K.

With both of his parents being preachers and his siblings all being vocalists, it's no surprise that he began singing at only five years old.\n\n\"Music has been instilled in me all of my life,\" he confesses. \"So essentially, I'm just embracing who I am. At first, his young position in a large family relegated him to supporting roles, usually that of a background tenor. However, he was met with adversity due to a speech impediment. \"I used to have a bad stuttering problem and because of that a lot of people would stay away from me in school,\" he admits. In fourth grade he tried out for a part in his school's rendition of Oliver Twist, but the director dismissed him, informing him that he wasn't fit for the production: if he couldn't speak clearly, how could he ever expect to sing?\n\nGuordan's mother, however, observed that her son's speech issues weren't present in his singing and came up with a plan: she would truly make him sing for his supper. Instead of speaking to her, all of his communication would have to be in melodic form. \"I would literally sing to my mother if I wanted to go to the store, or outside,\" Banks recalls.\n\n\"Whatever I had to say to her, I would sing to her. Through that, I began to build my confidence and learned to talk without a stutter. It also helped me become the songwriter I am today, because I don't ever really write anything down with a pen or a pad. I just sing it out and whatever comes out is what I use and adjust to keep. If I could change back the hands of time, I wouldn't change being kicked out of that play. That experience made me who I am today.\"\n\nHis first single \u201cKeep You In Mind\u201d reached #1 on Billboard\u2019s Urban Adult Contemporary Chart in 2016.

Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world.

Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude.

During a bad patch in his life, when he\u2019d lost his woman, was stuck in a dead end job, and down on his luck, he decided to make a change. Leaving everything behind, he took to the road on a musical pilgrimage around America that would come to define his sound and himself. Picking up an old guitar in a pawn shop along the way he found gigs from town to town playing his way across the states in the tradition of the delta Bluesmen before him.\n\nThen while stumbling home drunk one night along the main drag of Nashville, he came across a crowd. The crowd were surrounding an old man playing a one string guitar made from a broom handle and a box, while playing drums with his feet. In that moment Ben new he had found the inspiration he was looking for. But it wasn\u2019t until he made his way to New Orleans that he managed to get his hands on such an instrument. Walking down the backstreets of the french quarter he found his way into an old instrument shop selling a cigar box guitar. And he realised that he\u2019d discovered something special.\n\nWhen he finally got back to London along with the collection of songs he\u2019d written along the road, he recorded his first album \u2018Broken Man\u2019. With nothing more than the equipment he had to hand, he self released the album to critical acclaim. The Blues Magazine called him 'A unique musical identity\u2019; Blues Blast Magazine described his songs as being 'of bleak beauty' and Americana U.K. hailed his work as 'A new Blues\u2019.\n\nSince then he has never looked back, going on to tour internationally four times to date, and releasing a second album \u2018City of Streets\u2019, independently and to great success. A maverick in the true sense of the word his live shows are the stuff of legends. Not only is he an excellent guitar player and powerful vocalist, but an awesome drummer too, and he plays both guitar and drums at the same time in a stunning show as a \u2018one man band\u2019.", "otherInfo": "Ben Hemming will be performing live for an hour on Facebook in light of the current venue closures."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aaron Goodvin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389327.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aaron Goodvin\u2019s most Warner Music Canada / Reviver Records release \u2014 V \u2014 is available now and includes the #1 Canadian country hit \"You Are\" along with Top 10 singles \"Bars & Churches\" and \"Good Ol' Bad Days.\" The Canadian Country Music Association Award winner also boasts an impressive songwriting track record, with songs recorded by country music stars like Luke Bryan, Jon Pardi, and Cole Swindell.\n\nAfter appearing as a writer on Luke Bryan\u2019s multi-platinum selling album, Crash My Party, Aaron\u2019s star power continued to rise.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "The man behind Derek Smalls of Spinal Tap, voice of Mr. Burns/Ned Flanders/Principal Skinner/Smithers and so many more from the Simpsons, and Saturday Night Live alumnus among countless other titles, Harry Shearer will speak with Michael League about seeking, unleashing, and organizing your creative potential.\n\nEntry is based on a donation basis between $1-100.

The Los Angeles based troubadour uncovers an era-spanning style of his own at the crossroads of traditional folk songcraft, impressive guitarwork, bluesy gusto, and 21st century pop adventurousness. The singer and songwriter sifts through a lifetime of influences in order to assemble a vibrant, vivid, and vital vision.\n\nThis poignant, passionate, and personal style resounds throughout his 2018 EP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of popular music that I respect and the classics I grew up on, because they will always be a part of who I am,\u201d he explains. \u201cI started out by making a lot of Americana folk rock, but I really wanted to explore new sounds. For the first time, the new music reflects everything\u2014from what inspired me to be a musician and a guitar player in the first place such as Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Jackson Browne to artists I\u2019ve just discovered in recent years like Ed Sheeran. There are those songwriter elements as well as the modern nuances. I feel as if I\u2019m moving with a new generation.\u201d\n\nSince his emergence in 2015, he has quietly set the stage for such an evolution. At 19-years-old, Corey dropped out of college in Eugene, Oregon, grabbed his guitar, and relocated to an eternal haven for creatives of all kinds: Venice Beach, CA.\n\nJust blocks away from the Pacific Ocean, he spearhead the genesis of an arts collective and hangout known as Winston House. After reposting clips of Corey on guitar, Cody Simpson tapped him to handle six-string duties on a national tour. Meanwhile, Justin Bieber caught a Winston House performance and invited Corey to open up a run of Pacific Northwest dates on the sold-out Purpose Tour in 2016.\n\nTeaming up with producer Andrew Wells [Meghan Trainor, Jason MrAZ, Bebe Rexha, etc.], he unveiled the On The Run EP following his appearance on the historic tour. Its title track racked up 7 million-plus streams as he garnered widespread acclaim from Rolling Stone, Billboard, American Songwriter, Teen Vogue, Baeble Music, and more. Along the way, he toured with the likes of Niall Horan, Noah Kahan, and more.\n\nIn early 2018, he relocated to a studio in Topanga, CA. Exploring new sonic territory, he started amassing an arsenal of guitar pedals to \u201ccome up with new riffs and sounds\u201d and channel \u201cwhat the past year looked and sounded like into a six-song EP.\u201d\n\nNow, Corey introduces that EP by way of the single \u201cWild Nights.\u201d It juxtaposes a cinematic piano-driven soundscape with bluesy guitar and handclaps before culminating on a slick, soulful, and soaring confession, \u201cI\u2019ll give up all the wild times, jump into the wild fires, just to have one more wild night with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about knowing that you\u2019re so in love with someone and satisfied that you\u2019d never want anybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you were ever separated from this person, you\u2019d give up everything just for one more memorable night together. You\u2019d sacrifice everything.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the EP, \u201cDried Blood\u201d stretches from stark and stripped verses into a powerhouse chant. Meanwhile, \u201cCloser\u201d pairs a steady and strong beat with plaintive acoustic guitar and another hard-hitting hook, \u201cI just want you closer, closer than my demons.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Corey emerges with a striking signature sound that immediately connects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to inspire others to have a voice of their own and be themselves,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic did that for me.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anik Khan ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brian Puspos ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "El Fantasma ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9514662.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clint Boon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619722.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Govinda ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618337.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Loose Leaf Talent Agency and JamCast Network are proud to present StreamFest Episode One!

The band has also toured the UK multiple times, performing to 50,000+ at the giant international festivals BoomTown and Shambala.\n\nIn 2017, SOPHISTAFUNK was featured as the house band on five episodes of the Food Network show Guy\u2019s Grocery Games. During the show, host Guy Fieri called them his \u201cfavorite band.\u201d This has been covered by new outlets such as The Village Voice (NYC) and BuzzFeed. The band still maintains a close personal connection with Fieri, frequently playing private parties for him and his friends across the country.

In 2016, SOPHISTAFUNK recorded a live show featuring five members of Snarky Puppy (2x Grammy winner). They have rocked the stage with Rebelution, SOJA, Bass Nectar, Disco Biscuits, Lettuce, & Soulive (to name a few), as well as classic acts such as Aretha Franklin, Parliament Funkadelic, Foreigner, Rakim, & KRS One.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

Paired with Undlin\u2019s knack for eccentric musical arrangements and unpredictable, fresh modes of storytelling, Pharmakon bounces between two worlds, never lingering in one for long.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that this dynamic, oscillating motion inspired the creation of Undlin\u2019s upcoming release. \u201cWhen I was writing these songs, I was moving between extremes and trying to look at things differently,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cI was exploring the black and the white and then the gray.\u201d The word \u201cpharmakon,\u201d defined by Plato, is the concept that something can either be the poison or the cure, depending on how much one consumes. \u201cI love that idea, of the two polarizing sides of something that could either be the answer or kill you,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cAnd I think the concept is suited to the album. It was written over an intense period of a couple of years,\nwhere I was redefining my own power in music.\u201d Dotted by highs and lows, this period of time didn\u2019t always feel victorious. However, the final product is a resolute album that brings attention to the universality of women\u2019s experiences throughout time. Inspired by myths and stories such as the legend of Persephone, a modern retelling of Eve\u2019s ancient dilemma, and Angela Carter\u2019s heroine-themed fairytales, Undlin crosses centuries and cultures. \u201cThe track \u2018Wolf Alice\u2019 is inspired by Carter\u2019s version of the fairytale of the same name, which became a vehicle to talk about the attempted \u2018civilizing\u2019 of women\u2019s bodies as an oppressive force throughout human history,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cOn \u2018Eve Boards A Train,\u2019 I imagined Eve getting kicked out of the Garden of Eden and into America\nin 2019. In this story, Eve has boarded a train and is writing a letter to someone .\u201d Just as the characters in these tales didn\u2019t always know which turns they were going to take, Undlin is coming to enjoy the mystery of the creative process. \u201cThere\u2019s this myth that comes with being an artist that there\u2019s gonna be this one defining moment of success where everything suddenly makes sense,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s actually a crock of shit.\u201d Though she admits that the process of creating a brave album can be fraught with pain and disappointments, Undlin\u2019s upcoming release is nothing short of triumphant. Along with the heroines of the fairytales that inspire her, Undlin is fearlessly blazing ahead, no matter where the winding forest path might take her.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ali in the Jungle ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10394808.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Alternative, Art Rock, Indie Rock, Indie", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ali In The Jungle have been swapping instruments and jumpers in front of live audiences since 2013.

Her introduction\nto jazz was the result of the fortuitous location of her upbringing, the village Samois\u00adsur\u00adSeine\u2014the\nsame place where legendary gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt had lived. Every June for decades,\ngypsies have descended upon Samois, setting up caravans in nearby meadows for the annual Django Reinhardt Festival. During those June nights many years ago, after her parents would fall asleep, a\nyoung, curious Aim\u00e9e would climb out her bedroom window and wander into the gypsy encampments.\nAim\u00e9e would sing by the fire with Django\u2019s descendents and began to fall in love with the gypsy way of\nlife\u2014scampering home before the sun rose. Explained Aim\u00e9e, \"I was hypnotized by gypsy music which\nmade me want to tap my feet\u037e music that swings makes me so happy.\"\nAs a teenager, Aim\u00e9e performed in various Parisian caf\u00e9s and clubs. When her family moved to\nSingapore, she remained in Paris to attend the American School of Modern Music. She also auditioned\nfor \"Star Academy,\" a kind of French \"American Idol.\" Selected to be one of 16 semi\u00adfinalists, Aim\u00e9e\nhad second thoughts when handed a contract that tied her up every which way for years\u2014including the\nsongs to sing. This was too much for her gypsy spirit\u2014so she quit. The French media so pursued\nAim\u00e9e, she sought refuge in her mother's homeland of the Dominican Republic.\nGiven it\u2019s proximity to New York City, Aim\u00e9e then opted to attend SUNY Purchase on a scholarship.\nShe discovered campus life as a freshman and Manhattan as a sophomore\u2014and her musical influences\ngrew in leaps and bounds.\nIn 2006, Aim\u00e9e organized a backpacking tour of Europe where she and musician friends played and\nsang on street corners. In 2007, the group targeted jazz festivals where they performed for food and\nlodging. On a whim, Aim\u00e9e entered the Montreux Jazz Voice Competition and won\u037e the prize included\nthe financing of a her first full\u00adlength recording, \"Cyrille Aim\u00e9e & The Surreal Band.\" Just months later\nanother surreal experience would follow: Aim\u00e9e found herself performing on a major European tour with\nthe French supergroup Caravan Palace\u2014filling\u00adin for their ailing lead vocalist.\nIn recent years Aim\u00e9e has toured in many different contexts and has created several self\u00adproduced\nrecordings, including duet projects with Brazilian guitarist Diego Figueiredo. She won the Sarah\nVaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition in 2012, the same year she released the self\u00adproduced,\n\u201cLive at Birdland\". Aim\u00e9e's talents caught the attention of Stephen Sondheim, who cast her in an Encores Special Presentation starring Bernadette Peters at New York City's City Center in November\n2013. Holding her own as an actress, the New York Daily News exclaimed, \"Aim\u00e9e is the revelation.\"\nIn August 2014, The New York Times referred to Aim\u00e9e's major label release \"It's a Good Day\" as \"a\nbravura turn, presented with a smile.\" Featuring originals as well as covers of classics, the band is the\nresult of Aimee\u2019s unique musical vision: bass, drums and three guitars (Brazilian, gypsy and jazz).\nAim\u00e9e's hybrid of influences has resulted in a sound that's at once both fresh and enlivening, which is to\nsay nothing of her singular voice\u2014destined to enthrall audiences for decades to come.", "otherInfo": "Live stream on Facebook and Instagram at 3PM CDT.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/cyrilleaimee/live\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cyrilleaimee"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anjunabeats ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8972674.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Progressive Electronic, Electronic, Trance", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Anjunabeats is Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki. They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

It was during these formative years that Fokis developed a love for music and a work ethic that placed him amongst hip hop\u2019s hardest working entrepreneurs. Fokis began rhyming at an early age and later began to produce his own music. Seeking to enhance his career, Fokis pursued formal training as a recording engineer, later opening his own recording studio Krystal Clear Recordings. There, Fokis recorded and mixed for many artists including Big Daddy Kane, Fat Joe, Skyzoo, Torae, Dres, N.O.R.E, Kool G Rap, Brand Nubian, Chi-Ali, Ras Kass, Mic Geranimo, Bubba Sparxx and Rahsaan Patterson. His passion and commitment to succeed literally placed him on the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d. Early in his career, Fokis developed an online reality show based on his own experience as an independent hip hop artist seeking to secure a record deal within a year\u2019s time. Consistent with reality, the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d did not result in Fokis signing a record deal. Not deterred, Fokis went on to release several albums collaborating with various artists such as Joe Budden, Olu Dara (Nas\u2019 father), Deemi, Joell Ortiz and various producers such as Ty Fyffe, Focus\u2026(Aftermath Ent.) Fantom Of The Beat and Jake One. Fokis released various projects including the \u201c20/20\u201d EP exclusively produced by Focus of Aftermath \u201cRecognize Your Power\u201d EP with Edo. G & Shabaam Sahdeeq which was produced entirely by Fokis, \"This Thing Called Life\" which was produced by Oh No. all of which were well received by his fans.\n\nFokis has toured the United States and abroad, performed as an opening act for artists such as Common, Busta Rhymes, M.O.P., The Beatnuts, Onyx, Das Efx, Masta Ace and more. Through his experiences, Fokis developed a relevant broad appealing style and sound that remains true to the core foundational elements of Hip Hop with a commercial appeal. Though achieving success releasing his own music, Fokis realized in this era it would take more than pursuing a career as a recording artist to rise to the level of success he sought to achieve. As his experience with the business side of the industry grew, Fokis established his own independent record label, Loyalty Digital Corp. Through his label, Fokis has worked with and Executive produced projects like \u201cAn Ode To Reasonable Doubt\u201d by Skyzoo & Antman Wonder, \u201cBarrel Brothers\u201d by Skyzoo & Torae, \u201cNever Left\u201d by Sadat X and various others. Most recently, Fokis has created a membership based artist and producer collective called Local-Mu12. The members span from all over the world and are wrapping up their third LP for release this year. Fokis & Loyalty Digital\u2019s many achievements have been recognized by various blogs such as Complex, HipHopDX, NahRight, 2DopeBoyz, RapRadar, XXL and The Source to name a few. In his own words Fokis states \u201cI am a dreamer, a visionary and a grinder with a capital G.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Friday May 29th we are Live From The BX with Grandmaster Caz & Nine.

The Edmonton, Kentucky-based rock n\u2019 roll quartet Black Stone Cherry was raised on musical forefathers such as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and the Faces, among other 1970s staples, and, now, with its sixth album, Family Tree, BSC salutes its classic rock heritage and honors its legacy with a beast of a Southern rock n\u2019 roll album.\n\n\u201cWe caught divine intervention with this one,\u201d guitarist Ben Wells says with a good chuckle. \u201cWe hit a creative spark and tapped into a spirit and a fire we hadn\u2019t before.\u201d Drummer John Fred Young adds: \u201cFamily Tree showcases all of our collective musical influences and how we have taken those to create something that is truly our own unique Southern American Rock \u2018N Roll Sound.\u201d\n\nFor 17 years, Black Stone Cherry has put forth a new vicious breed of Southern rock, injecting youthful vitality and a myriad of fresh new influences into the beloved American rock tradition. To date, the band has released five critically acclaimed albums, and one well-received blues EP. Black Stone Cherry has also rocked 12,000-cap arena shows, topped the UK charts, and shared the stage with a diverse roster of superstars, including Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, M\u00f6torhead, and ZZ Top.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry came together in 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, eventually coalescing around the lineup of Chris Robertson, vocals and guitar; Ben Wells, guitar and vocals; Jon Lawhon, bass and vocals; and John Fred Young, drums. Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry. The four of us are family.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sammy Rae Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8845198.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.sammyrae.com", "otherInfo": "Join Sammy for some songs / a chance to go live with Sammy so she can interview YOU!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eddison ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8983427.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Tech House, Disco, House", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Never static, always moving, EDDISON is currently playing more than a hundred shows a year.

He spent six years performing in the hardcore circuit and released an independent album with a huge fan following before moving to Philadelphia, PA.\n\nSoon after arriving in the city of Brotherly Love, he co-founded the Philadelphia-based rock band Octane (2000-2005). Still considered to this day as one of the most successful bands to come out of Philly, Octane sold more than 20,000 copies of their independent debut release and enjoyed more than 1000 spins of the single \u201cI For One\u201d on Philadelphia rock station 94.1 WYSP.\n\nDuring this time, Quinn was named \u201cBest Guitarist\u201d in the Philadelphia region by the Philadelphia Music Awards in 2001 and 2004 and was routinely praised by fans and critics alike for his signature guitar technique, especially on slide guitar, and dynamic on stage presence.\n\nAfter enjoying five successful years with Octane, Quinn left the band to found a blues-based hard rock band that would later become known as Fosterchild. This project would quickly gain national attention and the band was signed to the SMG/ILG/WARNER record label from 2007-2010.

There will also be a special limited edition of the album available only on the benreel.com website, which will include 5 bonus tracks.

This was highlighted on his 2012, 18 song best of album (Ben Reel 1999-2009 Compilation 10) released only as a limited edition for loyal fans to buy at gigs, also available on iTunes worldwide. Ben\u2019s music has evolved into an honest earthy sound that has matured like a fine wine and he has very much his own sound today. This can be heard on this new album. Darkness & The Light is a powerful soulful album with deep meaningful lyrics and memorable epic anthemic songs, with strong melodies combined with imaginitive expansive arrangements. Recorded digitally but with an analog feeling of warmth. The songs deal with the struggles of life of ordinary folk since the global economic crash. Also probing for spiritual meaning and balance between the Yin and the Yang, trying to find light, hope and healing in these troubled times. Serious songs from a serious artist in a serious moment in time. In the last 10 years he has had numerous high profile TV & Radio appearances and airplay under his belt including Bob Harris BBC Radio 2 and has supported names like Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and appeared as a special guest at one of Hal Ketchum's shows in Dublin.

Rainy Nights nails down the pang of loneliness that emigrants feel when they are far from home and someone says something that just triggers regret. The easy, soulful melody and performance underlines the impact, with Reel\u2019s singing striking just the right note. It is the high point of the album. Though Feel Alive , the title track and the gospel of Old Bog Road come close. The Armagh singer-songwriter comes across as a honest man determined to use his love of music to best effect, and he is lucky in having a band, particularly guitarist Mick McCarney, full of expression and no little skill. www.benreel.com Download tracks: Rainy Nights, Time to Get Real http://dvdfever.co.uk/reviews/erbenreel.shtml Elly Roberts reviews The Ben Reel Band: Time To Get Real Another little gem from the Emerald Isle. Rating: 8/10 Irishman Ben Reel has consistently released solid albums over the past 10 years. My last CD encounter was 2007\u2019s fabulous New Horizon. Now on his fifth album, Time To Get Real, keeps that tradition well and truly alive with a dazzling collection of Americana crossover songs that ought to have ears pricking at all the \u2018real music\u2019 stations. Reel has a penchant for ignoring fads and trends keeping the focus on real music which is why he\u2019s become a cult artist in his native Ireland, though sadly he hasn\u2019t been picked up as genuine singer-songwriter in the UK. Everybody in the business knows he\u2019s hot stuff having supported Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and stage star Michael Ball no less. The good news is he doing rather well in Holland, Belgium and Germany. As an introduction to the album he\u2019s released Feel Alive as a single. The down and dirty groove has some sublime guitar licks carried by a great melody and his rough edged vocals. ________________________________________ This box of delights opens with a gentle country shuffle in the form of Rainy Night as the band moves with confidence and swagger, again with Reel dropping in some superb guitar breaks and a fine line in vocal gymnastics including falsetto along with a Neil Young-like harmonica swish. The introduction of songbird Julieanne Reek on the deliciously tender love ballad Summers Always Here only adds to the romantic mood. With a troubled heart he gushes with lyrics like \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re like the warm summer sun that\u2019s rising / Feel your warm love in my heart / Melting away the cold ice of winter / The storms have passed / There\u2019s a new life on the way.\u201d Embracing an eclectic mindset, Keep On Drivin\u2019 takes on a C.C.Rider rockabilly hue drenched in honeyed vocals, stylish pedal steel, thumping basslines and wah wah, whereas Time Slips Away is deeply reflective, yearning for his childhood days and the onset of wisdom now he\u2019s turned 35. A heavy funky bass, rolling organ, and acoustic chords make Who You Are the albums catchiest song, with the main hook coming in the chorus. For Old And Wise Reel delves deep into a more traditional Irish template which brings forward his wishes not to die a typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll death \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t wanna overdose like a rockin-roll star /Or choke on my vomit after whiskey in the jar.\u201d By far the best song on the album, closes it \u2013 the stripped back dusty-bowl ballad Old Bog Road. Reverbed harmonica leads to gentle acoustic picks, chords slabs and wailing solos, on what is essentially a mournful ballad. The verdict \u2013 Quality album. http://www.billybop.be/admin/CDdetail.asp?ID=8717 Ben Reel : Time To Get Real \u2013 CD, BRBCDA-007;B Reel Records Album Kindly Submitted by G-Promotions Style : Americana Rate (1-5) : Ben Reel is the latest addition to a series of Americana artists emerging from Ireland! Against the backdrop of the troubles in Northern Ireland, Ben first picked up his guitar when he was 15 years old inspired by greats like Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young. Today this inspirations are still to be found in his passionate music! Leading track \u201cRainy Night\u201d is one of those tunes that you start to whistle along without ever having it heard before! Country and Americana are the main genres on this album but this doesn\u2019t mean the album is limited to it. On \u201cFeel Alive\u201d Ben comes with some enjoyable soul influences while \u201cKeep on drivin\u2019\u201d throws in a lot of country as does \u201cLooking for a Lost Horizon\u201d. \u201cOld & Wise\u201d throws in some old styles and mix folk influences into this Americana tune. On \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d the title track of this album, Ben Reel, returns to his old habits and creates a song that could be from the hand of \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Closing down the album is \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d that opens with a beautiful haunting blues harp. The haunting keeps going on, both with his voice and slide guitar! As an extra, hidden track we can hear a nice rockabilly kind of version (Live) of Keep on Drivin\u2019 in a mix with the classic \u201cTrain Train\u201d Time To Get Real is already the fifth album for Ben Reel and in the past two years he has successfully toured Holland, Belgium and Germany steady working on a growing fan base. Back you\u2019ll can find him as supporting act for bands like the Cranberries, Alabama 3 or Jools Holland. The album is a true Americana effort and comes with handful of interesting tunes that makes me feel that this artist need to be in the spotlight a little more. Mr Blue Boogie http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews2009/ben_reel.htm BEN REEL Time To Get Real (2009) Play this new Ben Reel CD to any music aficionado, and ask them where it was recorded. Nine out of ten would say Nashville. Guaranteed. Now, Ben Reel may not be a household name (yet), but let's assume for a moment his work is unfamiliar to you. OK, what genre music would you say Time To Get Real was? No problem - southern, country blues rock. And name any influences you can hear at play? Again, no problem - Neil Young is an obvious one, but also Springsteen and perhaps Chris Isaak and even a little Clapton circa 361 Ocean Boulevard. So, nationality? No brainer - a man from the deep south of the US of A. Wrong on all accounts, because Time To Get Real is the 5th album in 10 years from Irish guitarist and singer songwriter Ben Reel. And naturally it was recorded in Monaghan in the north of the emerald isle. In reviewing Ben's last album New Horizon (2007) - which had an altogether more 'west coast' feel - we pondered on image, and what might make Ben stand out from the likes of Marc Cohn. It may be that with Time to Get Real, and diving deep into Americana, Ben has found his niche. Beautifully played and recorded it's bound to strike a chord with the market that's fuelling the resurgence of Neil Young, and Springsteen's exploration of the American psyche. But the challenge is still to get his music across the pond. It's not easy to crack America - many have tried and failed, but the rootsy warmth of the songs, the soulful singing and classy playing (some wonderful blues guitar and harmonica work) would undoubtedly be lapped up with a little exposure. So remember the name - Ben Reel - a real class act. *** Review by Pete Whalley http://www.lonesomehighway.com/pdf/online-issue-7.pdf Ben Reel Time To Get Real B. Reel Northern Ireland native Ben Reel has delivered a roots album that is full of strong songs and good playing. There\u2019s some solid keyboard playing, a rhythm section that drives things along and some very tasty guitar from Mick McCarney. Reel\u2019s voice is accompanied by welcome backing vocals that help to portray the mood of the songs. Rainy Night sets the tone for time and place, a song that looks at what has been missed by moving away from your home town. Other topics are ageing, freedom, the nature of searching and of truth. Mature songs for a mature audience that\u2019s given a melodic and malleable musical base that could just as easily have come from the States as from Northern Ireland. Reel no doubt has taken from those who have also come from the North, such as the undeniable influence of Van Morrison as a beacon of musical innovation. Reel does not have Morrison\u2019s track record, but this is an album that shows all the signs of a true talent making his own way. It\u2019s time to get serious is the signal Ben Reel gives with the release of his latest cd \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he before? Haven\u2019t got a clue because for me Ben Reel is a complete stranger. He is (northern) Irish and has been working at his craft for quite some time. \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d sure is a good way to get to know him and the cd is full of piercing impulses. Delicate songs, strongly carried by the accompanying musicians, but by no tarnishing ben\u2019s Vocals. (His vocals show comparisons to Rod MacDonald and John Stewart). I hope that I grow old and wise suggests that Ben has come to an age where he starts realising his own mortality, what undoubtedly determines the profundity you find again in his lyrics. With what I don\u2019t want to affect his compositions. As I said before, I only know Reels past from what I read in his biography, But \u201cTime to get Reel\u201d indeed looks like the start of a new development, a new awakening. No trace of a personal crisis. My guts tell me Ben Reel has defined he wants to make a good product. One he will be remembered by. The closing song \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d tells of a permanent goodbye Ben Reel manages to create a excellent variation of styles, and within a limited nr of spins I still a real positive feeling about Ben Reel. Serious, skilful. driven \u2026. (after the official songs there is a hidden track, a live song, where you hear the presence of a modern day Elvis. Not renewed, but very entertaining. www.rootstime.be /Rein van den Berg Oct 09 The Irish hearts are often rather melancholic. Maybe the beautiful sceneries see to a tendensy of warmth and retirement. It characterizes at any rate the dark songs of Ben Reel, which the cover of the newest album, time to get real, suggest. Eleven songs written by reel himself and richly arranged with violin, piano, appropriate guitar lines and a choice of extra additioned instruments. With this the Irish know how to display a large scale of spheres and feelings, carying names as Neil Young and sometimes Bob Dylan. Indeed in rags, because Ben Reel is a slippery costumer. Ben\u2019s first album, \u201cthis is the movie\u201d, came out in Ireland in 1999, after this the EP \u00ebxorcise me\u201d(2000) only with 3 tracks, which seemed to be forerunner for his second album \u201cLost in Haze\u201d (2001). After that came Sweet Victory (2004), U People (2006) and New Horizon (2007). We don\u2019t have to complain about man\u2019s releases and qualities: guitarplayer Ben Reel, born in silverbridge but now living in Castlebalyney, is a supreme storyteller; has a pleasant voice, writes, beside that, upperclass songs and has also the quality to gather very able musicians around him. At his new album Ben Reel is accompanied again by a fine equilibiated band: Ronnie, Michael. Mickey, John, Colin. And now we are calling names: the recordings were done in the Attic studios with producer Ronan who also has a vocal contribution in the last two songs. In the quite openers Rainy Summers etc. we hear Reel\u2019s wife Julieanne who takes the change of the singing second. Anyway, in their natural but yet larger soundscape is more than enough space for improvisation and variety, which we can hear clearly on their new album. What Ben has settled with this successor is impressing. In 11 songs the band knows to create an oppressing atmosphere, which gets enlightened only now and then. Rasping and grating, then again with deceptive lovely acoustic guitars, then with thin guitarsounds and spacious violin, the listener is taking to a voyage through the Deep South of the mind, which only can turn out bad. It is oppressing, dark, stirring and especially very beautiful. Roots, pop and folk are going hand in hand with now and then an experimental strain. The point is that Ben Reel makes magnificent music. Music that mixes influences from alt-country with the atmospheric and darkness the music from Ireland so often charcterizes. Music that attracts attention by the variety and the highstanding music, because they really can play. Ben Reel searches, with his new album, joining with the greatness of the alt-country, but takes here at the same time surrender. Time to get real is just a good patterncard of the ability of the Ben Reel Band. Everything sounds beautiful, clear and especially respectable. The sharp ends are removed expertly and almost everything is produced in a way that it has to be specially accessed for the singersongwriter radiosize.

There's lots to inspire and Ben Reel has absorbed those influences and let them inform his particular style of travelling blues. \"Time To Get Real\" isn't a classic troubadour album, but it is deep hearted blues packed with characters, places and just a wee bit of drinking. The songs are strong through out, all could standalone without being thought of as filler. Time to step up from being a solid support to being the headliner. BELGUIM http://www.ctrlaltcountry.be/Pagina1.htm#BenReel BEN REEL \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d (Ben Reel) (3,5****) Ireland has long been enjoying a good reputation, where the singer-songwriters are concerned. And with Ben Reel has another one to be proud of. With \"Time To Get Real\" the man has just delivered his fifth album in ten years time, and that is a very beautiful album. Reel is gifted with a warm, a little soulful vocal style, shows himself a truly excellent song smith and professional manner together in genres like rock, pop, folk, Americana and blues into his songs. He calls himself Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young as inspiration, but there really is not much sign of that. Reel sounds like a particularly original. Someone with a vision of his own writing and placing songs. Someone with an own sound. And it would absolutely not surprise us if he behave the songs on \"Time To Get Real\" soon break on larger scale. He fully deserves it already! Songs like it a little reminiscent of Neil Young \"Rainy Night\", the beautifully subdued piano and harmonica work on-going rootspopdeuntje \"Summer's Always Here\", the soulful rockin 'Feel Alive', the bluesy bounce \"Keep On Drivin '\", the summer, somewhere between pop, folk and country resident \"Old & Wise\" is simply magnificent. (Ben Reel is doing these days also Netherlands and Belgium for some gigs. On November 13 he is as such in McCormack's Irish Pub in Turnhout. And De Sport in Geel On Monday 9th http://www.ilpopolodelblues.com/rev/novembre09/recensione/ben-reel.html Ben Reel is part of the wide array of successful songwriters born and raised in Ireland. More precisely, the North and administratively part of the English crown. Yet in his music are heard echoes of Neil Young or Bruce Springsteen rather than those of the island's musical tradition.

(SWA) REAL ROOTS CAF\u00c9 Netherlands Dutch to English translation Very recently came from Time to get real, the fifth full-time CD of Irish singer-songwriter Ben Reel. For me a great unknown, but already 20 years active in music since he was a teenager in 1989 founded his first band, \"Trim the Velvet '. After the breakup of this band eight years later, Ben's solo tour in 1999 and came from his solo CD's available. With five number one so he just scored an average of two years each. Ben's music is best described as Irish mid-tempo alt-country, the songs are nice sound and treat a number of pressing issues for Ben. He describes one part of his life and Rainy Night Time just slips away, do proclaim his feelings, especially love, respect, in four songs and shares his thoughts with us and future expectations in another four songs. He concludes (No. 11 is) a kind of summary of this in Old Bog Road: Seasons change as people come and go, life and death is the endless flow. Want to find the answers, because the story to be told, is not gonna quit the mining for gold. Want to find a reason before I go. Before they take my body, down that old bog road. Heavy thoughts for a guy who has several years of the 40 removed. But we are not all looking for the deeper meaning of life? Incidentally, after more than six minutes of the final number is still nearly six minutes a lasting valve closure, which Ben totally in style and tempo rocking (leading to a sodden organ) announces yet another time by a wish to: (I 'll) keep on driving, a live concert recording and a perfect valve. Always funny, some unexpected hidden track. Ben's band was great response and are in addition to Ben's acoustic guitar (and occasional harmonica) bass, drums and electric guitar. A few songs do keyboards and violin along. Ben has a somewhat gritty but pleasant voice. His wife Julianne sings along to eight songs, four songs is half Bloch (e, you never know with those Irish first names) to hear. I think it's a good CD, especially through the expressiveness of the songs both lyrically and in terms of melody (Fred Schmale) Put simply and aptly, New Horizon is all killer, no filler! Rarely have I heard an album so complete and so fully realised. From the brilliance of the playing and arranging to the magnificence of Reel's voice, this is heaven all the way. A superb album by an artist good enough to hold his own in rock\u2019s premiere league. Andrew Hobbs, Hi Fi + magazine When it comes to making classy albums, Ben Reel's your man. Year on year, Reel's songwriting is growing in stature in every department, yet he still doesn't get the wide spread recognition he richly deserves it's one of the strongest albums this year. This CD isn't just music: it's art. AllGigs.co.uk review of New Horizon, 8th October 2007 Ben Reel, a native of South Armagh, has in the words of one journalist \u2018operated under the media\u2019s radar for far too long\u2019. On the evidence of this release, his fourth album, I would have to agree. The songs and the playing are really impressive, an earthy mix of rock, roots and blues, all mixed lovingly together with soulful vocals. His song writing shows maturity and progression which comes through with repeated plays. Featuring some great slide guitar from Micky McCarney and terrific vocals from Kelie Redmond, \u201cHell In Ur Own Head\u201d is a standout, closely followed by the semi spoken \u201cWhen Will Be Ever Be Free\u201d. \u201cFor U And I\u201d shows the band at their best with a lovely rock/soul groove that you wish would go on longer. All in all this is an impressive album from a major talent who needs further investigation.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "Pub Party Fridays brought to you by Flora Hall Brewing.

In his own way he goes about singing songs from all over the spectrum with an ease that is only fitting of one who is many years older and a prowess on guitar that is singular in its ability to stand alone without accompaniment. Its a wonderful mystery to behold how the essence of any song can be captured so simply by one voice and a guitar, but he does it with originality, taste and an unexpected power for someone who isn\u2019t really on the radar to the wider music community. And it is with a resigned sense of purpose that this 29 year-old Canadian continues to write, interpret and perform music in often the humblest of capacities. This is his path. And he must follow it to the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always say \u2018you must inspire yourself, find your path, be true to it and follow it to the end\u2019 because that\u2019s really all that needs to be done in this life. If you can do that then there is nothing to worry about. Whatever your path may be, it will always teach you everything else you need to know about life on the way. For me there is a feeling of obligation to music because it is so clearly the best thing I can offer to the world, but I often fight it in favour of other things only to eventually realize I\u2019m not honouring my true path. So it becomes a balance between seemingly opposing forces that in the end put me right where I need to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe opposing force he is referring to is his commitment to a contemplative life of meditation practice. A life traditionally aided by long hours of silence and rigid structure; not a life typically lived by a working musician. After several years of torn aspiration between the life of a Buddhist monk and pursuing a serious music career as a singer/songwriter, Corey is settling somewhat into a situation he feels best serves both of these energies. He feels by maintaining a low-key, almost anonymous attitude to his live performances and online presence he can still allow room to teach guitar (another precious pastime) and spend a few hours alone each day in silent meditation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part I play gigs around here in Southern Ontario. Usually just really ordinary pubs, cafes and restaurants to people who may or may not be listening all that intently but I can show up, play my heart out and leave without having to worry too much about selling tickets, or CD\u2019s and merchandise, trying to make something happen or grow my brand or whatever. I can play covers the way I want, maybe play some originals if I feel like it, work out the kinks of my delivery and be spontaneous. I often don\u2019t even say who I am. Sometimes I don\u2019t really say anything at all. Which is exactly how I go about making my videos as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver the years, a devoted worldwide following has sprang up through his YouTube channel where he posts performances of popular and not-so-popular cover songs as well as his own material which has helped define his purpose with music. He plays many kinds of songs without pandering to any one listening demographic and often without much of anything in the way of effects or editing. Just 20 years of craftsmanship and passion on display. The response is overwhelmingly positive as viewers experience the consistent quality and creativity of each performance. Whether its the music of musical heroes or his original songs, its difficult not to be impressed by the standard at which he sets each time he plays.\n\n\n\n\u201cPutting up videos on YouTube has been such a wonderful way for me to exercise my musical freedom and play all the songs I love \u2014 from artists I admire \u2014 and challenge myself to grow as a musician publicly. It allows me to connect with people from all over the world and reminds me why its important for me to do what I\u2019m doing, because they appreciate it. I earn very little money from this medium but its been a constant motivator and mirror for me to reflect and improve which makes it such a valuable aspect of what I do. I really neglected it while I was away travelling recently, which was necessary because I was busy gigging, busking and trying to make ends meet but now that I\u2019m back home with my recording gear I\u2019m looking forward to making videos more consistently.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter spending 18 months in Australia and California doing performances mostly on the street as well as in \u201cordinary pubs and restaurants\u201d half a world away, Corey has returned to Canada and settled in Kitchener, Ontario where he performs regularly, teaches students and still finds time for silence and meditation.

As a DJ, producer and mogul whose label is at the forefront of modern electronic dance music, it goes without saying that Nicky is a force to be reckoned with. From the iconic hits \"Toulouse\" and \"I Could Be the One\" to his recent #1 US Dance Radio track \u2018Sometimes\u2019 with DallasK & Xylo in 2019. Nicky's resume boasts an impressive and lengthy discography of originals, remixes, edits and co-productions, proving again and again his ability to evolve with the ever-changing landscape of electronic music. Perhaps even more telling of his razor-sharp prowess and visionary mindset is the success and impact of his label Protocol Recordings, setting up recent collaborations with David Guetta, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.\n\nIn the late 2000's, EDM was having its heyday, and Nicky Romero was at the forefront of the movement that would become one of the most significant cultural resurgences in decades. After releasing several singles early in his career, Nicky officially had his breakthrough moments with the viral anthem \"Toulouse\" and \"I Could Be the One\" (vs. Avicii), which to date has amassed over 185 million streams on Spotify alone. Nicky's meticulous skill as a producer led him to co-producing with legendary artists, both on Rihanna's hit \"Right Now\" and Britney Spears' \"It Should Be Easy.\" These early successes served to pave the way for the founding of Nicky's own label, Protocol Recordings.\n\nNicky created Protocol Recordings in 2012, and in the last six years it has grown from a record label to a truly multi-faceted household name in electronic music - but they're still only getting started. Nicky created Protocol to be a place of camaraderie between forward-thinking artists, always daring to break the mold through innovative sounds. Protocol's diverse list of artists currently includes Raiden, Maximals, Tom Tyger, Florian Picasso, Sunstars, Corey James and many more. To support the development of his artists, Nicky recently built Protocol Studios, a state-of-the-art complex with five production studios, a radio studio, and a live recording studio to encompass the end-to-end musical process. Additionally, the label's successful radio show Protocol Radio reaches over 40 million listeners each week, and its live presence has expanded to showcases at ADE, Miami Music Week and more.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Craig Morgan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7992037.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Saying there is a \u201cwhole lot more\u201d to Craig Morgan is an understatement. The multi-faceted Renaissance man proves it on his upcoming new studio album, aptly titled A Whole Lot More To Me, a record that furthers Morgan's reputation as one of the genre's most commanding vocalists.\n\nWhile his singing on such hits as the multi-week Number One \"That\u2019s What I Love About Sunday,\" \"International Harvester,\" \"Bonfire,\" \"This Ole Boy\" and \"Wake Up Lovin' You\" was exemplary, Morgan has somehow found a new level and vocal range in the studio. On his forthcoming LP, his third with label home Black River Entertainment, he's making the most relevant, authentic and moving music of his career. It's a point that \"When I'm Gone\" drives home, as Morgan sings about living life with no regrets.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a renewed energy with this record,\" he says emphatically. \"In fact, I'm at the pinnacle of my career \u2014 producing, singing and touring. And this song epitomizes that. It's about living to the fullest, and when people hear it, I know they'll relate it to their own lives.\"\n\nHis newest single, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon,\u201d is an epic love song and one of many radio-ready hits on Morgan's highly anticipated project. He's written nearly half of the album's dozen tracks, and makes all of them his own. \"I'm That Country\" exudes Southern charm; \"Remind Me Why I'm Crazy\" showcases Morgan the crooner; \"I Can't Wait to Stay\" exults the joys of a small-town life; and \"A Whole Lot More to Me\" is a musical autobiography. The collection\u2019s \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone,\u201d has already met critical acclaim with Music Row calling it a \u201cpowerhouse performance of a pile-driving song.\u201d Each highlights his artistic renaissance.\n\nMorgan laughs at that word, however: \"artistic.\"\n\n\"I have friends who are very artistic people, sometimes oddly so, and I never wanted to be that guy, to be so artistic that I'm odd,\" he says smiling. \"But it's good to know that I've evolved musically and, with this new record, I've created something with longevity.\"\n\nIndeed, Morgan's A Whole Lot More To Me, co-produced with Byron Gallimore (Tim McGraw, Sugarland, Faith Hill) and released via Black River Entertainment, is a timeless recording. As was their goal, Morgan and Gallimore, with whom he worked for the first time, succeeded in making music that will sound fresh a decade or more from now. These are songs that define a man.\n\nMorgan uses the honesty of the concert stage as an analogy for how he assembled what will be his seventh studio album. \"It would look funny if you went to one of my concerts and I stood out there in skinny jeans. I'm not 21 years old, and I shouldn't pretend to be,\" he says. \"But I also know this music will fit right in on country radio today. I'm singing music that is real and believable and at the same time relatable to all types of fans. That's hard to do, but you can do it if you stay true to who you are.\"\n\nAnd Craig Morgan knows exactly who he is, a man with many sides. Along with being an entertainer, he's an adventure junkie and hosts the popular Outdoor Channel series Craig Morgan: All Access Outdoors, entering its seventh season this summer. He's also a 17-year Army and Army Reserves veteran, a passionate champion of the military, a philanthropist and a celebrated motivational speaker.\n\nHe\u2019s a busy man with a knack for attention to detail. Carefully choosing each lyric on this album is no exception. There is not a single wasted verse \u2014 let alone word \u2014 on the follow-up to 2012's This Ole Boy. \"Every word is valid and relevant on this album,\" he says. \"It's a quality continuation of what I've done in the past.\"\n\nThe most obvious bridge to Morgan's back catalog is the spiritually minded \"Country Side of Heaven.\" The song is inspirational country at its finest, with a soaring chorus that at once elevates both listener and artist.\n\n\"It has a very charismatic, inspirational vibe about it \u2014 but not preachy,\" Morgan says. \"The energy feels spiritual by the time you get to the end and there is an emotional attachment within you that makes you want to hear it again and again.\"\n\nMorgan says the song, as well as album tracks like the emotionally charged \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon\u201d and the empowered-woman tale \"All Cried Out,\" act as a through-line, a path for fans to connect the dots of his career: \"You develop a fan base and they get acquainted with a certain thing from you, and they want that. This album is full of those.\"\n\nAnother standout on the project is \u201cHearts I Leave Behind,\u201d which features Morgan\u2019s gritty and poignant vocals with the soulful Christian rock band Third Day\u2019s lead singer, Mac Powell.\n\nThe hard-touring artist has already been testing out the songs on the road, to stellar results. \"When I'm Gone\" becomes a call to action; \"Country Side of Heaven\" is an audience sing-along; and \"Nowhere Without You,\" written by Michael McDonald, stands as an epic power ballad.\n\n\"It's such an emotional song, one that I can see being played at weddings for a long time,\" he says. \"I feel something in my chest when I hear it. It moves me \u2014 and that's what music is supposed to do.\"\n\nEspecially in the hands of an artist as gifted as Morgan, who can effortlessly toggle between the breezy fun of radio staple \"Redneck Yacht Club\" and the poignancy of \"That's What I Love About Sunday.\" He mixes both approaches in the album's standout track, \"A Whole Lot More to Me.\" A smoldering, jazz-influenced love song with an everyman attitude, it shines a light on a different side of the artist, and country fans in general \u2014 one that likes a fine Cabernet as much as a cold beer, and indulges in sushi by candlelight as regularly as barbecue by the bonfire.\n\n\"As a country singer, we sometimes get stereotyped as nothing but trucks and tailgates, but that doesn't mean that's all there is to us,\" he says, summing up the album. \"I want people to hear this record and go, 'Wow, there is a whole lot more to these country folks.'\"\n\nAnd in Morgan, those folks have no better messenger.", "otherInfo": "Fridays at Four Live Series"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Patricia Vonne Fan Page ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8732530.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Border Rock, Latin Alternative, Americana, Rock, Country Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Patricia Vonne has proven herself a truly ascendant and transcendent musical artist.

With rigorous minimalism and maturity, chief songwriter Shaun Morgan \u2013 long one of rock\u2019s most unheralded melodists, has become a composer of deep emotion and clear-eyed vulnerability. The band too has developed into one of rock\u2019s most fearsome units, playing with precision, grit and authority, yet still light on their feet. After 15+ years of hardscrabble success, it\u2019s evident that Seether felt like survival was not enough. They had something to prove with this new album \u2013 somewhere farther to go.\n\nOne reason for the new approach must surely be Seether\u2019s close partnership with ace producer Brendan O\u2019Brien (Springsteen, Pearl Jam). More like a member of the band than a hired gun, O\u2019Brien repeatedly championed Morgan as one of music\u2019s most gifted songwriters and vocalists and Seether as one of rock\u2019s most extraordinary bands. His unrelenting faith in their talent and potential has been something of a North Star for Seether, helping them struggle through and outlast some very dark times.\n\nRecognizing that he needed to limit distractions, in early 2013 Morgan went about constructing a refuge in his New Hampshire home \u2013 a space where these new songs could develop and take shape. \u201cI actually built a room that I could write in,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI personally pulled out the carpet, put in wood flooring, decorated, and painted. After getting off the road, it was a process of preparation to get the environment just right. I made a place that I felt comfortable and creative in. I was able to be safe and isolated, concentrating on writing music instead of dealing with the distractions that come with daily life.\u201d\n\nLyrically, Morgan has never been afraid to look his demons in the eye. The people in these songs confront the truth with simmering rage; it\u2019s the fuel they need to make them feel alive. \u201cThe whole record is a collection of diary entries,\u201d Morgan revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s just where I\u2019m at and what I\u2019m going through. I\u2019m writing songs about getting through whatever situations I\u2019m in at the time. These songs deal with relationships and life situations.\u201d\n\nMorgan emerged with a collection of fleshed-out ideas that the musicians honed during rehearsals together in drummer John Humphrey\u2019s native Oklahoma. By the time they assembled with O\u2019Brien to record the album at Hollywood\u2019s Henson Studios in January 2014, their vision had clearly come into focus.\n\n\u201cIt felt so natural,\u201d explains Humphrey. \u201cWhen we get together, there\u2019s an indescribable chemistry. That\u2019s all over this album. The three of us can jam together and finish a song pretty quickly. We were really focused. These guys are my second family. We\u2019re tight musically and otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe band cut the entire album in sixteen days. The swift recording pace did not allow them to smother the tracks with overproduction, but rather gave the songs a chance to breathe. On working with O\u2019Brien, bassist Dale Stewart enthused, \u201cHe\u2019s like a fourth band member at this point. We understand each other. He likes to get in there and work quickly and he encourages us to be ourselves. We often followed our first instinct. That allowed us to capture the moment.\u201d\n\nThe album opener, \u201cSee You At The Bottom,\u201d quickly locks in with brutal force as Morgan\u2019s Beatles-meets-Nirvana wail comes screaming out of the speakers. From there, the album never lets up.\n\nGnashing riffs underpin another infectious chorus on the virulent first single, \u201cWords As Weapons.\u201d Morgan\u2019s remarkable ear for indelible melodies is truly the band\u2019s secret weapon. It\u2019s what makes Isolate and Medicate so damn listenable. Morgan makes unrelenting despair a fun listen.\n\n\u201cSame Damn Life\u201d \u2013 a boiling rejection of suburban sprawl juxtaposed against Morgan\u2019s surgery falsetto \u2013 is a pop metal surprise. \u201cI always felt like there was something there,\u201d Morgan said of the song. \u201cIt started from a riff and went into a vocal idea. I\u2019m a big fan of The Beatles. It\u2019s fun to do something with that pop element. Those are the songs that stick with you.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s centerpiece, \u201cCrash,\u201d is quite possibly the most beautiful song Seether has ever recorded. Gorgeous vocal lines and warm, fuzzed-out guitars cascading into pulsating wall-of-sound atmospherics mark an undeniable creative peak for the band. \u201cIt\u2019s different from what we\u2019ve done in the past and that excited all of us,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t follow the stereotypical formula. It\u2019s pretty. It\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s emotional and deep.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the band\u2019s fresh outlook is the strong support and enthusiasm they feel from new label partners The Bicycle Music Company/Concord Music Group. The brothers-in-arms feel was galvanized with their new team. \u201cIn one of our first meetings with the label, we played everybody five or six completed songs,\u201d Morgan remembers. \u201cThis marked the first time anybody outside of the band and Brendan listened to it. Afterwards, everybody was really excited and happy. Seeing the level of enthusiasm was great. That felt like the moment everything came together. It was a rebirth, in a sense.\u201d\n\nSeether has worked tirelessly to reach this point. The hard rocking outfit originally from Pretoria, South Africa has now released eight albums in all, two of which have gone Platinum and two more that are certified Gold along with a live concert DVD that has sold over 500,000 units \u2013 for total worldwide sales in excess of 4.5 million. The consistent hit makers have quietly amassed eleven #1 singles and seventeen Top 5 multi-format hits resulting in singles sales that top seven million \u2013 a level of success few artists working today can match. Seether has averaged 120 performances a year, crisscrossing the globe, emerging into headlining mainstays and featured performers on many of the world\u2019s biggest rock festivals.\n\nIsolate and Medicate will undoubtedly resonate deeply with the group\u2019s fiercely loyal fans. \u201cI hope everybody can feel this,\u201d concludes Humphrey. \u201cIt\u2019s a special album for us, and we put everything we had into it.\u201d\n\nMorgan completes the sentiment, \u201cI want them to walk away having enjoyed the music. I want them to get the same emotional sense and happiness we feel listening to it. It\u2019s so important and tied to memories we\u2019ve all had. When somebody listens, it\u2019ll hopefully make them feel good. They will know they\u2019re not alone. That\u2019s the reason we do it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join Dale as he makes traditional South African Jerky at 5PM CT on 5/29.

Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music -

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete.

The band's style has been influenced by conventional indie pop, psychedelic music, vaudeville and music hall on their earlier releases and by afrobeat, funk, krautrock and reggae on their recent releases.\n\nThe band's style has been known to change between albums. At first, the band embraced a more simple, quirky, lo-fi indie pop sound, which occasionally bordered on twee pop. The band was created by Kevin Barnes and named after a failed romance with a woman from Montreal, though the story changes in various interviews. Barnes was the only member of the \"group\" prior to his relocation to Athens, Georgia. There, he met Derek Almstead, later of Circulatory System, M Coast, Elf Power etc., and Bryan Poole, who also performs as The Late B.P. Helium.\n\nTogether, they recorded their first album, Cherry Peel, as well as The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower and The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy.\nA number of singles and a re-release of The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower occurred before the release of the band's third album, The Gay Parade in 1999. With contributions from several members of the Elephant Six collective at the time, it also featured artwork from Kevin's brother David Barnes, who would continue to do artwork for future albums.\n\nThis album marked that the band had moved to a fuller sound, which is also found on its follow-up, Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse. These two albums contain more narrative lyrics, as opposed to the rather personal lyrical matter of those preceding it, and often imitating the style of old 1950s radio plays.\nAfter production on The Gay Parade began in 1998, Poole left the band to focus on his duties with Elf Power, another Elephant Six band from Athens. Barnes also recruited Jamey Huggins and Dottie Alexander, who had been performing together as Lightning Bug vs. Firefly, to play various instruments. Derek moved from drums to bass. The band was joined soon after by Marshmallow Coast's Andy Gonzales.\nFollowing the release of The Gay Parade, the band signed with Kindercore Records, who would release a number of singles and compilations. It wasn't until 2001 that Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse would be released as a new album with original material. The album again featured contributions from across the Elephant 6 spectrum.\n\nIn 2002, Aldhils Arboretum was released, with a slightly different sound than its predecessors, as the songs were more directly structured. This album marks the beginning of the change in of Montreal's sound, with more danceable rhythms than ever before, especially on the album's closer, \"Death Dance Of The Omipapas and Sons For You\". A successful tour ensued, including of Montreal's first trip to the UK, along with a tour-only EP.\nKindercore Records would fold shortly after the release of Arboretum, and of Montreal's status was also threatened. Kevin got married, and Andy and Derek left the band. Barnes, being uncomfortable with the unrest, as well as some divisions within the band, took to writing and performing their 2004 album Satanic Panic in the Attic mostly by himself. Released by Polyvinyl Records, it became one of their more successful efforts to that point. The 2004 tour saw The Late B.P. Helium (Bryan Poole) rejoin the band, with some bass played by Kevin's partner Nina Barnes. The album marked a shift to an The sound shifted to something more electronic with traditional structures, to be further advanced in later albums and new songs. In their most recent releases and concerts, the band has fully embraced a sort of techno-pop glam image, with little of their previous incarnations surfacing. This style is featured in singles such as Disconnect the Dots. The style would continue to evolve into 2005's The Sunlandic Twins, which was even more a Barnes solo effort. Recorded in Athens, with the exception of one track recorded in Norway, it was a much more pronounced electronic album. The album became a success, mostly due to the singles \"So Begins Our Alabee\" and the MTV clip for \"Wraith Pinned to the Mist (and Other Games)\".\n\nThe band released several collections of singles in early 2006. Barnes recorded most of the band's 2007 release, Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?, by himself while living in Norway and Athens, Georgia. The switch to autobiographical themes of suicide, depression and isolation of the album was a direct product of his troubled personal life during that period.\n\nof Montreal's next album, Skeletal Lamping, is scheduled to be released in October 2008. The album has been leaked to Internet through various torrent sites.\n\nLyrically, their style has changed dramatically throughout the years. In the beginning, many songs were narratives of personal or humorous situations, such as \"Tim, I Wish You Were Born A Girl\", from Cherry Peel. This style, however, changed with The Gay Parade, where many songs involve small narratives surrounding invented characters (in songs such as \"Jacques Lamure\", \"The Autobiographical Grandpa\", \"Mimi Merlot\" and \"Rose Robert\"). Others act as extracts from fictional conversations (\"Advice From a Divorced Gentleman to His Bachelor Friend Considering Marriage\" and \"Good Morning Mr. Edminton\" as examples). With Aldhils Arboretum came a slight return to the previous writing style, except following more poppy, classical lyrical structures (such as the use of choruses, which are generally absent in the Gay Parade/Coquelicot years). This style continued throughout Satanic Panic and The Sunlandic Twins to some extent. On the band's most recent album, Hissing Fauna: Are You The Destroyer?, the lyrics are much more personal than previously used, with songs detailing emotions within the speaker.\n\nAnother unique quality of the band is the fusion of ostensibly gloomy lyrics with bouncy, upbeat melodies and hooks. On Aldhils Arboretum, for example, the lyrics for tracks like \"Doing Nothing\" and \"Old People in the Cemetery\" focus on apathy, loneliness or death while being contrasted with cheerful instrumentation. Another example of this tendency is shown in their choice of covers; for example, Yoko Ono's \"I Felt Like Smashing my Head Through a Clear Glass Window\" from The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower.\n\nTrue to the style of most Elephant 6 recording artists, of Montreal's members have been in a variety of side projects and other bands:\nThe band itself has performed as the backing band for Marshmallow Coast on record and on tour.\n\nMy First Keyboard was the pseudonym used by Dottie Alexander to release the song \"The You I Created\" on the Kindercore singles club. of Montreal acted as her backing band.\n\nKevin Barnes did a comedy tour with his wife, Nina, and his brother, David, called \"A Pollinaire Rave\".\nJamey Huggins released an album under the name James Husband, which featured a cover of The Beatles' \"We Can Work it Out\".\nBryan Poole has a solo career as The Late B.P. Helium.\nKevin Barnes has recently been collaborating with Andrew VanWyngarden from MGMT, on a project called Blikk Fang (formerly Ocelot Fang).\nDerek Almstead has worked with many artists as a musician and engineer including his collaboration with Andy Gonzales - M Coast, Elf Power, Circulatory System, and many more.\nKevin Barnes played keyboard in a song on Bright Eyes' album Letting Off the Happiness.\nThe song \"Wraith Pinned to the Mist (And Other Games)\" can be heard on radio and television commercials with words changed for an advertisement for Outback Steakhouse.

To date we have released numerous singles & EP's, a live album, a DVD and nine full length albums and have had the good fortune of being able to play across a large portion of the world. We are truly grateful to the many friends and bands that have helped us out and supported us along the way in the US, Canada, Europe, U.K. Ireland, Scandinavia, Greece, and Australia as well as the many countries we look forward to playing in the next century.\n\nThe bands\u2019 main goal is to play music that creates an all for one, one for all environment where everyone is encouraged to participate, sing along, and hopefully have a good time. In the true spirit of punk rock we view the band and the audience as one in the same; in other words our stage and our microphone are yours.\n\nIn addition to hopefully bringing people together for a good time, we hope to share some of our experiences and beliefs in working class solidarity, friendship, loyalty and self- improvement as a means to bettering society (i.e. You can preach till you\u2019re blue in the face but if you\u2019re lying in the gutter no one\u2019s gonna listen.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "A weekly show of tunes I play now and used to play long ago.

Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP. A lyrically driven, wearing her heart on her sleeve, completely open and honest EP titled Apartment 101 released in 2019.", "otherInfo": "Enjoy an hour of Erin Bowman Instagram Live for a cocktail, conversation & performance."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "White Denim ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10392187.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Fusion", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In his 1942 essay The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus wrote that \u201cAll great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning.\u201d 15 years later Richard Wayne Penniman wrote \u201cWop bop a loo bop a wop bam boom\u201d, an undeniably powerful vocalization that on any given Wednesday in any given situation, civilized or otherwise, is still fully capable of setting somebody\u2019s stuff aflame. Over ten years and seven long players into their career, White Denim are still in the relentless pursuit of a thread- in other words, a wick.\n\nThe band have carefully studied the greatest records ever made, but they write songs just dumb enough to drink, dance, and fight to. Theirs is a music that aims for the whole body, while equally satisfying the mind. While it has morphed, expanded, and even burst apart, White Denim\u2019s sincere and human drive and ability to spark exhilaration have been unerring constants of the band\u2019s existence. Now, two years on from their comeback album supreme 'Stiff,' singer-guitarist Petralli and bassist Steve Terebecki have changed tack again for their seventh full-length, 'Performance.' A new studio, new collaborators, and new techniques for writing and recording influenced the elastic possibility and liberation felt throughout.\n\nIf the album\u2019s title seems meaningful in its deadpan simplicity, it is. There is, of course, the meaning of \u201cperformance\u201d that applies to anyone for whom the live arena is the proving ground. There\u2019s also something more personal but universally acknowledged \u2013 the gap that exists between what we project and who we really are. \u201cThere is something absurd and isolating in continuing this pursuit for personal connection on such a wide scale. When writing an album I essentially leave my actual life, retreat deeper into myself and as it nears completion, I evaluate my work based on my own extremely skewed notion of what is widely relatable and still legitimately cool,\u201d says Petralli. \u201cMy idea of cool is most significantly shaped by Steve\u2019s body language when we are talking through ideas in session.\u201d It has been said that \u201cA clown enriched knows neither relation nor friend.\u201d\n\n'Performance' was mainly recorded over eight weeks at the band\u2019s new downtown Austin studio, Radio Milk. Once an old general store constructed in 1902, it is now respectfully restored and sandwiched in between bars and modern condominiums. Two new players were key in what Petralli describes as \u201ca super-collaborative record:\u201d keyboardist Michael Hunter, a \u201cyoung, humble genius with endless potential\u201d and Conrad Choucroun, a \u201cridiculously solid\u201d drummer with a long stint with NRBQ on his resume. \"If you take nothing else from this at least take some time to listen to NRBQ, rock & roll scholars who shared members with the Sun Ra Arkestra\" advises Petralli. It makes sense that White Denim would develop a kinship with a player from their circle. In many ways, they are a continuation of that sort of group. One that will never stop pushing and taking every opportunity to shine a light on and exemplify what is truly good about Rock & Roll music.\n\nCategorically speaking, White Denim is still impossible to narrowly pin down. There\u2019s the glam-rock strut of \u201cMagazin\u201d and \u201cIt Might Get Dark,\u201d the dueling guitars on the low-slung blues prog of \u201cMoves On\u201d, and the sideways jazz of \u201cSky Beaming.\u201d There are plenty of pleasingly unexpected musical moments on the title track and the easy-rolling closer \u201cGood News,\u201d along with some seriously distorted guitar. In the title track, Petralli sings, \u201cFlashing light in a tunnel, You\u2019re indicating a change.\u201d In many ways, White Denim is the flashing light in a dark and crowded tunnel of showbiz glop.

Working again \u2013 and unknowingly, for the last time \u2013 with busbee, the pair maintained her roots and his contemporary sense. The down-to-earth female vocalist has quickly carved out her own highly honest, emotionally compelling place in a very Pop-Country world.

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Christina Martin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10397212.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Pop, Roots Rock, Singer Songwriter, Americana", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Christina Martin is a multi-award winning Canadian singer-songwriter whose style has been described as an effortless union between Americana and Rock. \u201cWith her vivacious personality, brightly sparkling voice and unerring love of hooky choruses and peppy rhythms, Christina Martin should\u2019ve easily slid into the cool waters of modern pop\u2014if only pop hadn\u2019t become a pimp for our shallowest tastes and sentiments.\u201d (Edmonton\u2019s Vue Weekly).\n\nRaised on Canada\u2019s East Coast, Martin moved to Austin, Texas in the summer of 1999. In the fall of \u201999 she moved to Salzgitter, Germany where she collaborated on a commercial pop project, marking her first experience singing in a professional studio. In May 2000 she returned to Austin to explore performing and song writing. Following her role as supporting vocalist and dancer for the Austin high-energy rock band Young Heart Attack in 2001, Martin launched her solo career in 2002 with an opening slot for Wilco and her debut album Pretty Things. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010). Two Hearts won Martin two 2008 Music Nova Scotia Awards, and a 2009 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\nHer third album I Can Too (2010) received rave reviews and includes a collaboration with Blue Rodeo\u2019s Greg Keelor on her rendering of Andrew Sisk\u2019s Subject To Change. \u201cWhat sets I Can Too apart is Martin\u2019s commitment to honestly exploring complicated relationships.\u201d (Exclaim Magazine, October 2010). Following multiple East Coast Music Award Nominations and extensive touring across Canada with Juno nominated indie rock band Cuff The Duke, Martin began touring independently in Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nIn 2011 Martin worked on building her label Come Undone Records, and focused on developing a global online presence with fans via community-based projects. She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year. This project also raised awareness and funds for the Canadian Mental Health Association. During 2011-2012 Christina continued her community development initiatives with a yearlong Artist in Residency through Geriatric Medicine Research (GMR) at Dalhousie University and The Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2014 she released an EP titled Remember Me, featuring five songs inspired by and dedicated to individuals affected by dementia. Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "Join Dale and I for another Live Stream event from our home on Facebook this week.

The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him.

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

Not just because she was only one of about seven Black kids in her junior high school, but because of the compelling power of her shockingly big voice, which stopped people in their tracks from early on. Danielia\u2019s natural gift--raw, searing vocal chops combined with a deep, buttery tone--draws from the two different rich traditions that she absorbed early in her youth. On the one hand, she couldn\u2019t get enough of what her friends and neighbors were listening to: AC/DC, Zeppelin, the Stones. On the other, she was her mother\u2019s girl: daughter of a jazz singer and member of the church gospel choir, grooving to Mavis Staples, Etta James, Billie and Ella.\n\nThe happy collision of these two traditions is her new album, Rare Child, produced by Brad Jones (Jill Sobule, Over the Rhine) and co-produced by Joe Blaney (Shawn Colvin, Soul Asylum) and Danielia herself. On Rare Child, the sheer joy and pain she evokes in her songs instantly draw the listener in. She pulls, stretches and grips her lyrics with a strength that is startling considering this lovely young woman\u2019s seemingly happy-go-lucky demeanor and petite frame. Appearances aside, like male counterparts Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone or crossover icon Tina Turner, Danielia not only has embraced the notion of Black Rock--she has redefined it.\n\nVery early on, music played a major role in Danielia\u2019s life. It became not only the focus of what would become her career, but also, her saving grace and her best friend. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have music saving me every day, I wouldn\u2019t have a place to put a lot of emotions that I have that could potentially be destructive,\u201d says Danielia. \u201cIt\u2019s how I survive.\u201d Citing her mother, Danielia speaks lovingly about musical influences that aren\u2019t quite from the playbook of most Rock performers. \u201cI loved Phyllis Hyman\u2019s ..Somewhere In My Lifetime,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201cand Chaka Khan. But not just the popular stuff. It was her version of ..I Loves You, Porgy\u2019 from Gershwin\u2019s Porgy and Bess. My mom also listened to things like Bonnie Raitt and Loggins & Messina. But for me, it was listening to Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder\u2019s album Songs In The Key of Life: it was about that tone that I thought was the best. And Nancy Wilson singing ..Guess Who I Saw Today\u2019\u2019; the first time I heard that I was like, ..I don\u2019t even like that genre\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t get over the delivery. There was so much emotion. I like artists that were living and feeling whatever it was they were singing about.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, more than any other important influence was Danielia\u2019s fascination with musical movies of the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s. \u201cI had a thing for Bing Crosby,\u201d she bashfully admits. \u201cI was an old soul. What entertained me didn\u2019t entertain most kids. But we had a deep life. So anything that would take me out of that life was important. Anything that was singing and had a story to it I liked.\u201d A very young Danielia would stand up on a wood crate in her backyard, grab a stick, and sing Donna Summer\u2019s ..Last Dance\u2019 to the trees and a few semi-curious deer, When she realized she could really belt it out, she decided she might make singing her career. Soon, 12 year-old Danielia joined her mom and aunts in a gospel group called Brookes Ensemble Plus, where she learned harmony. Around that time, Danielia received her first guitar. While her mother couldn\u2019t afford to pay for lessons, she gave Danielia a ..How To\u2019 book that the young writer devoured, locking herself in her room until she came out a comfortable player and had penned her first song.\n\nDanielia\u2019s home life wasn\u2019t always easy. Danielia never met her father, a native of Puerto Rico. Moving around a lot and experiencing the hardships of racism, Danielia had to grow up fast. And although Danielia came from very humble beginnings, the one thing the family was not lacking was love and determination to succeed. Raising four kids on her own without a college degree, Danielia\u2019s mother nevertheless became the head of accounting for Houghton-Mifflin Publishing and was determined to make sure her children had the best education possible. To that end, books were in no short supply at home (spoils of the trade), and the children learned to read at an early age, while calculators were treated as toys. Following her mother\u2019s example, Danielia strove to make the most of her opportunities, and in her junior year of high school, she gained entry to the Mercer County School of Performing Arts. Danielia excelled and graduated at the top of her class, going on to obtain a full scholarship to the esteemed Bennington College in Vermont, from which she graduated with a degree in Theater Arts.\nBennington was a major turning point for Danielia. There, she studied with the great avant garde jazz trumpeter Bill Dixon. Noted for his vocalic playing style, Dixon, who founded the Black Music division at Bennington, gave Danielia the guidance she needed to refine her distinctive power as a singer. By her junior and senior year, she was studying tutorials. \u201cHe trained my ear. I\u2019d go to his class every day, and he\u2019d hit a note on his trumpet and ask me to match it. I thought it was the most God-awful thing. But I realize today that my pitch is the way it is because of this training. He taught me basic music theory, keyboard harmony and what music reading and writing was. During my senior year, he sent me to study singing with the classical department so I could learn breath, which is where I found my power. He would die to know I was singing rock \u2018n roll now instead of jazz, but he changed my whole perception of how you sing a song.\u201d\n\nUsing classic songs like Eden Ahbez\u2019s \u201cNature Boy\u201d and reading the lyrics as a soliloquy, Danielia learned that \u201cin any good song, there\u2019s a story; it\u2019s a moment. And it\u2019s the same when you get onstage with those same set of words and discover how you can convey that story to an audience. It helped me realize why I loved singing. It was about the story, the tone\u2014it wasn\u2019t about all the ..tricks.\u2019 It was about singing the line straight. That took more skill.\u201d She credits Dixon with teaching her how to \u201csing ..ugly\u2019.\u201d She explains, \u201cYou have to be able to sing the wrong notes if you ever want to sing beautifully. You have to be able to be ..ugly\u2019 sometimes. That\u2019s where you find your true beauty.\u201d\n\nQuietly writing her own songs under wraps while she studied, she performed several original compositions at a recital after she spent her final year at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Drawing raves for her performance as well as her songs, she had learned well by then that her lyrics had to be pulled from her own life experiences in order to be authentic and received in such a positive light. \u201cI have to write from what I know about. It\u2019s like in acting. I can\u2019t play a character who\u2019s 70 at the age of 30. I don\u2019t know what 70 is. I could go to my grandmother and ask her and she might say, ..It\u2019s a loss of faith, it\u2019s tired\u2019 or whatever, but I don\u2019t know this because I haven\u2019t been there. I could only play a role and be true to something I felt. Because then it\u2019s true.\u201d\nAs a performer, Danielia is glad she grew up pre-American Idol. \u201cMost kids today, if you ask why they want to perform, they\u2019ll say they ..want to be a star\u2019 or ..be in the music business.\u2019 I liked music not because I saw it as a way to get out of the life I lived and have more than what I had, which wasn\u2019t that much. I did it because it was fun; it was like a drug. I\u2019ve always felt a little selfish when people say, ..I do it for the people.\u2019 I do it because it does something for me.\u201d\n\nRadio stations across the country appreciated Danielia\u2019s unique rock talent. After Danielia released her first studio album, 2005\u2019s Small White Town (Hipshake Records), WXPN/Philadelphia and home of the nationally syndicated World Caf\u00e9 named her \u201cArtist To Watch\u201d in 2005, slotted the album\u2019s soulful single, \u201cIt\u2019s Only Life\u201d into heavy rotation, and featured her on their HDNetwork broadcast of \u201cOn Stage at World Caf\u00e9 Live\u201d. WXRT in Chicago featured Danielia on New Year\u2019s Eve, where she brought down the house in a live performance broadcast by ABC.\n\nExtensive national touring followed. Danielia traveled the breadth of the country, opening for some of the greatest acts in music, from Blues legends Buddy Guy and Etta James to Pop Rock giant Bon Jovi, to the Southern Rock royalty of Gregg Allman, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Little Feat. Crossing boundaries was no problem for the versatile Danielia, who has wowed alternative rock audiences of the Flaming Lips, Staind and Collective Soul, among many others.\n\nDanielia\u2019s unique talent drew rave reviews, with notices on her \u201craw intensity\u201d (Essence magazine), her \u201csoulful voice and searing telecaster\u201d (Time Out NY) and for possessing \u201cthe sort of voice for which the phrase ..force of nature\u2019 was coined\u201d (Austin American-Statesman). Relix magazine named Danielia one of the \u201c5 Artists You Should Know\u201d in 2007 and New York\u2019s Amsterdam News proclaimed Danielia \u201ca powerful musician that cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\nThose high accolades often come from those who\u2019ve been blown away by Danielia\u2019s live act. Audiences that experience Danielia and her band live are hit hard with the sheer emotionalism of her songs, and Danielia\u2019s performance style is all about revisiting the feelings that brought those songs into being in the first place. \u201cI give you everything. I\u2019m going back, and these stories are obviously from my life. I\u2019ve picked moments that I can safely go back to time and time again without getting to a place where I can\u2019t collect myself. But, in my songs, I\u2019ll go to places that are still an issue for me. Like in the song ..Rare Child,\u2019 I say, ..On the day I was born/I hope my daddy cried.\u2019 Because I\u2019m still dealing with those issues. So you have to be careful. There\u2019s a responsibility to your audience too, because some of your fans will go there with you. And they don\u2019t know how to pull back either; they\u2019re riding on what you\u2019ve given them. You\u2019re handing them a drug too.\u201d Going back to the idea of music as an emotional release, for the artist and the audience in equal measure, Danielia not only accepts the responsibility, but rather, she is flattered and thrilled by it and sees it as an opportunity. \u201cWhen you hear some of the stories that people tell you and how the songs have helped them through tough times, that\u2019s as good as somebody telling you your album went platinum,\u201d Danielia says. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be about, and then you think, ..This might not be why I wrote this song, but this is what this person got out of it,\u2019 and I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nA stiff self-critic, Danielia admits to pre-show and pre-recording bouts of nervousness. \u201cEric Clapton always says, ..If I\u2019m not nervous, I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\u2019 But then that\u2019s where you get all that energy and you end up giving it back to the audience. And it means just as much to me in the studio when I record. At no time do I take it lightly. I want it to come out well. So it\u2019s harder than live, but I like to record with the band in the studio and I can pull from that energy.\u201d\n\nBut, as much as Danielia is a performer, she is also a proud and dedicated songwriter.\nInspiration for songwriting for Danielia comes at all hours, and her mindset is to grab the moment no matter when it comes and write it down. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up from dreams with an idea, and it was my grandfather that used to say ..God woke you up, and wants you to go get a pen and piece of paper and write it down.\u2019 Otherwise, the idea you had goes away. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get the call, you gotta pick the phone up,\u201d she says. As for when this inspiration hits, contrary to popular belief, it isn\u2019t always as a result of sadness or depression in Danielia\u2019s case. \u201cIt does tend to happen on a cloudy, rainy day, and I do agree with artists that it does happen at moody moments, or when you first wake up, when you\u2019re feeling not necessarily at the peak of happiness. But you can\u2019t always be the source for everything. I collaborate a lot. Like on ..Make U Move\u2019 I collaborated with Kareem Devlin and Shelby Gaines, who I worked with on a lot of the songs on this record. The beauty of co-writing is that when you collaborate, your co-writers take you to a place you normally wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d For example, on \u2018Make U Move,\u2019 one of the most infectious, rocking tracks on Rare Child, \u201cKareem and Shelby brought the track, and I wrote the melody and the words, and there\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve come up with that myself.\u201d\nDanielia is very candid about why she would rather wear her heart on her sleeve in her songwriting than try to deliver her music through a manufactured persona. \u201cSome people create characters to make it easier for them to perform, but that\u2019s just not me. I feel that when someone pays to come see me, they\u2019re coming to see me, and so I owe them that. And that\u2019s more interesting to me. Rock \u2018n roll is real, and that\u2019s what people want.\u201d Danielia describes Rare Child as \u201ca party, in a sense. It starts out saying ..I\u2019m gonna rock your world\u2019 but then it arcs, has some soulful moments, and has some upbeat moments. Like going to a really good party, it isn\u2019t all non-stop ..woo-hoo.\u2019 You might get into a deep conversation with someone in one corner and share a joke with someone else in another. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d\nIn making Rare Child Danielia\u2019s goal was to create an album that she could really play. \u201cI think this is an album that the audience wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd because we didn\u2019t try to write singles or do anything like that, it came out being a real rock \u2018n roll album, and that\u2019s exactly the way you have to go about it. And when you\u2019re lucky, it ends up being this great effort, which I think it is.\u201d\nThe meaning behind the album title is at once personal and universal for Danielia. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there, I don\u2019t see too many Black girls slinging guitars. And I know they\u2019re out there\u2014Tracy Chapman, Toshi Reagon\u2014but in the venues I\u2019m doing and the genre I\u2019m doing, a lot of times it\u2019s just me. Music is so manufactured nowadays.

The young Dallas native began to see a lifetime of hard work pay off in spades in 2015, as he signed with Sunfire Entertainment, released a critically acclaimed debut album, cracked the top 25 on the Texas Music Chart, and shared bills with Hayes Carll, Randy Rogers, Turnpike Troubadours, Green River Ordinance, and more. \"This is all I wanted to do since I was 14,\" he reflects, \"and now I'm doing it.\"\n\nWith so much momentum on his side, it's no surprise that Cartwright titled his new release 'Don't Fade.' It's a note-to-self that he more than lives up to on the EP, bringing together the heartfelt vulnerability of Ryan Adams and the arena-ready anthems of Eric Church into an infectious, genre-blurring masterpiece. The tracks showcase Cartwright's considerable growth, both as a writer and performer, while honing in on the sharp lyrics and soulful delivery that earned his self-titled debut widespread praise in Texas and beyond. The Dallas Observer called that record \"one of the very best of 2015,\" while the Fort Worth Star Telegram raved that \"there\u2019s an ease and a polish\u2026belying Cartwright\u2019s relative youth,\" and Red Dirt Nation said that it \"stirs what makes us all feel young and poignantly reminds us how fragile we all are when it comes to love, heartbreak and home.\" For Cartwright, though, it was only just the prelude.\n\n\"You never know what you don't know,\" he reflects from his newly adopted hometown of Nashville. \"I'm very proud of that first record and some of those songs have done very well for me, but with a whole additional year-and-a-half of hard touring and writing under my belt when we recorded 'Don't Fade,' I felt like I had a much better idea of how I wanted to sound and who I was as an artist.\"\n\nCartwright grew up in a conservative Texas home where his exposure to modern music was limited primarily to the 'Forrest Gump' soundtrack and Steven Curtis Chapman records. For his twelfth birthday, his parents gave him an acoustic guitar, and suddenly the entire world opened up. He discovered singer-songwriters and alt-country troubadours, contemporaries like Pete Yorn and classic artists like John Prine. It led him to begin penning his own songs, and by the time he hit high school, he was playing regularly in bars and churches. A summer program at NYU exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nCartwright worked his way through school with odd jobs in the music industry and wedding band gigs, and while they paid the bills, they left him unsatisfied and more convinced than ever that he needed to take the leap with his own music. He moved back to Texas and recorded an EP, 'Bull Run,' that earned him top honors in the B.W. Stevenson Songwriting Competition. A performance with John Fullbright led Cartwright to Oklahoma, where he collaborated with producer Wes Sharon on the self-titled debut that would break him onto the Texas radio charts.\n\nThroughout it all, Cartwright was a hustler to his core, playing 100+ shows per year without an agent or a manager, working harder than he ever had before in his life but moving closer towards his goals every day. The quality of the music and the exhilarating live performances were turning heads throughout the south, and that's when Cartwright caught the ear of fellow Texas songwriter Rob Baird, who offered to produce 'Don't Fade' with Brian Douglas Phillips at Phillips\u2019 Austin-based Rattle Trap Studio.\n\n\"We spent three or four days in total at Rob's house before we went into the studio because I had between 30-50 songs that I had written,\" remembers Cartwright. \"Rob and I went through each of them and pared the list down to figure out what made for a cohesive collection and what kind of sound we wanted to go after.\"\n\nThe sound that they ultimately landed on is instantly appealing, a warm, radio-friendly blend that calls to mind everything from Will Hoge to The Old 97's. Earworm opener \"Never Coming Back\" is an ideal showcase for Cartwright's gifts, with his silky-smooth vocals riding a laid-back drum groove punctuated by dynamic electric guitar riffs and classic rock organ swells.\n\n\"That was one of the first co-writes I ever did in Nashville,\" says Cartwright. \"I wrote it with Ty Graham, who had actually been my next door neighbor at Berklee during my freshman year. We always used to talk about girls and relationships in college, and when we sat down to write this song, the story was something we'd both experienced in our personal lives, so it came together really naturally.\"\n\nCartwright takes a darker turn on \"Busted,\" a driving, gritty tune inspired by the breakdown of a truck in the west Texas heat that mirrored the breakdown of his own crumbling relationship, while \"Nobody But You\" channels the pain of staying behind while a loved one leaves, and the sweetly emotional \"Don't Fade\" battles the inevitable passage of time. One of the most special moments for Cartwright, though, comes at the end of the EP, as the stripped-down acoustic meditation of \"Arkansas\" drifts off into an ethereal soundscape like the last rays of light at sunset.\n\n\"That ending was a very specific idea that came to me on a camping trip with my roommate,\" remembers Cartwright. \"We were spending the days and nights out in the middle of nowhere just listening to the crickets chirp and trying to figure out life, and I wanted to recreate that feeling.\"\n\nThe ability to capture such intimate, meaningful moments is the magic of Cartwright's songwriting. These are tunes about coming and going, uncertainty and change, finding yourself and what you're willing to sacrifice for your dreams. There are no dramatic revelations here, just the steadily deepening understanding of self that comes with maturing. Cartwright renders the sound of growing up beautifully and in vivid detail, capturing the anxiety and the ecstasy in all its messy, human glory. For a kid who grew up worshipping songwriters, to craft such exceptional music is to truly live the dream, and with another full length album on the way, it's safe to say Troy Cartwright's years are going to just keep getting bigger and bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anthony DeVito ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10265031.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Comedy, One Man Show, Standup Comedy, Stand Up Comedy, Stand Up, Sketch Comedy, Improvisation", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Anthony DeVito is a NYC based comedian who recently made his network television debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Parsonsfield ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10020224.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Sing-a-longtime, Americana, Folk Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Six years after coming together as a band of high-energy musical misfits\u2014too rock for folk, too folk for punk, too punk for bluegrass\u2014Parsonsfield found themselves standing at a crossroads. The critically acclaimed five-piece was down to just four members, and while the obvious solution may have been to simply replace their departed comrade, the group instead made the bold choice to completely reimagine their lineup and their catalog, carrying forward as a quartet with an ambitious new approach to writing and recording. The result was a genuine sonic rebirth, a wild musical awakening that brought Parsonsfield closer together than ever before and yielded their most exhilarating and adventurous record yet: Happy Hour On The Floor.\n\u201cRecording this album marked our first time working in the studio as a four-piece, and it was really liberating,\u201d says lead vocalist Chris Freeman. \u201cOnce the lineup changed, we realized that there weren\u2019t any restrictions on what we could do. It came with this boundless sense of musical freedom where anything felt possible.\u201d\nProduced by Benjamin Lazar Davis (Joan As Police Woman, Okkervil River), Happy Hour On The Floor fuses Parsonsfield\u2019s rustic instrumentation and timeless sense of songcraft with dreamy synthesizers and vintage drum machines. The arrangements here are broad and spacious, often built off spare, hypnotizing loops that fuel the songs\u2019 mesmerizing drive, and the band\u2019s performances are deliberate and economical to match, substituting lean, careful construction in place of the strummed exuberance that defined much of their early work. The result is a record all about finding happiness in simplicity, a captivating collection more reminiscent of modern indie pop than old-school string bands that pushes the group far beyond the perceived boundaries of its sound even as it shines a spotlight on the heart and soul of what\u2019s always made them such a joyous revelation.\nHailed by Folk Alley as \"the most jubilant and danceable indie roots music this side of the Carolinas,\" Parsonsfield\u2014Freeman, mandolinist Antonio Alcorn, guitarist Max Shakun, and drummer Erik Hischmann\u2014first emerged in 2014 with Poor Old Shine, an ecstatic acoustic collection that prompted The New York Times to praise them as \"boisterously youthful yet deftly sentimental\u201d and No Depression to rave that they'll \"give you rich five-part harmonies one minute [and] sound like bluegrass on steroids the next.\" The band grew more experimental on their 2016 follow-up, Blooming Through The Black, and the collection earned them both glowing reviews and dates with everyone from Josh Ritter and The Jayhawks to Mandolin Orange and The New Pornographers. That same year, the group saw their music featured in the hit AMC series \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and teamed up with the prestigious FreshGrass Festival to compose a score for the 1922 silent classic Nanook of the North, which they performed live alongside the film at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fake Four Inc.

And, since arriving in Nashville from Florida at seventeen, he's also always been about guiding his career equally from the gut and the heart. Since his top-streaming song \"Woulda Left Me Too\" introduced him as a singer with an unusually empathetic hand (and garnered millions of plays on Spotify), Griffin has been working to release music that finds his unique niche between R&B and country, and between fun and true vulnerability. And now, with three new busbee-produced tracks and more on the horizon, Griffin has never been more ready for this moment.\n\n\"I've never felt more true to myself than I have with this music,\" says Griffin. \"These songs have never felt so right.\" Indeed, \"Best Cold Beer,\" \"Good Company\" and \"Play It By Heart\" are pure Griffin: they're fun, as soulful and groovy as they are twangy, and uniquely perceptive, packed with razor-sharp insights about living and loving.\nThe child of hardworking parents who always instilled a deep work ethic in their son, Griffin spend his youth out in the sod fields and, in his down time, wrestling for any say in the car radio stations with his two brothers and his mom \u2013 to little success. But in hindsight, it was for the best: he ended up listening to everything from Vince Gill and George Strait to modern pop and R&B once he hit high school, and it shaped him in ways he didn't even realize at the time.\n\nOne evening his father \u2013 who also loved Jimmy Buffett \u2013 took him to a local country festival, and Griffin's future suddenly became clear: \"I got to see Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson and all of these dudes,\" Griffin remembers. \"That's when I realized this is what I want to do.\"\n\nA little boy who would hum melodies almost before he could talk, Griffin was always a musical kid, but his father, who raised two more sports-focused sons before him, didn't know quite what to do with him. So, one day, he pulled out the phone book.\n\n\"He said 'I'm going to call everyone who has something to do with music and find out what to do with this kid',\" Griffin remembers. \"He sat there for hours and there was finally this dude who answered the phone, and he had a studio in his garage which was kind of unheard of. My pops said, 'alright we'll be there this week.'\"\n\nGriffin went in and recorded a little demo, and that was it. He spent the rest of his teenage years opening for the likes of Neil McCoy and Highway 101, and playing any\nstage he could. Then, at seventeen, he finally followed his dreams to Nashville, enrolling at Belmont University, first in the voice program and then, afraid all the training would massage the character form his sound, in the Music Business program. And, like most promising graduates, he hit all the milestones: he won the country music showcase, played the Best of the Best, and scored an internship at Broken Bow that saw him hitting the road to help tour manage Jason Aldean.\n\nBut it still didn't all come easy after that: bouncing through a label and a publishing deal, Griffin sometimes wondered if this creative life was becoming too much of a hardship for his young family \u2013 but it was his wife who told him to stay the path and keep pursuing his dreams. So in 2017, he released his EP, Sake of the Summer, with \"Woulda Left Me Too\" now topping five million streams \u2013 and \"Dibs\" going to number one.\n\nFor this next sampling of songs (\"Best Cold Beer,\" \"Good Company\" and \"Play It By Heart\") Griffin just wanted to focus on making it relatable. \"I wanted to write songs that people could really latch on to,\" he says. \"To meet people where they are and provide an escape, while being truly authentic to me.\"\n\nAnd for Griffin, that means providing both plaintive moments and pure fun. Produced by busbee, these three songs are indeed both: a little bit Keith Urban and a little bit Brian McKnight, \"'Good Company' is a departure and it's an escape,\" says Griffin. \"You can't not dance and forget about all the B.S. But I'm not afraid of a vulnerable song that cuts to the heart, and 'Play It By Heart' is about how I live my life and how my wife and I walk through our marriage.\" And \"Best Cold Beer\" is a surprising lyrical twist about the lure of romance \u2013 and a good turn on the dance floor.\n\nHaving already opened for the likes of Ballerini, Lady Antebellum and Old Dominion, Griffin will take these songs on the road this summer at select festival dates while he hones his record. One of Rolling Stone\u2019s 10 New Country Artists You Need to Know he's also been highlighted on 2018 Ones to Watch lists by AOL, AXS, Country Fancast, NY Country Swag, PopDust and Thought Catalog \u2013 and all as a result of keeping his eye on his ultimate goal, no matter the circumstances.\n\n\"I always knew in my heart if I kept fighting, if I kept pushing and kept grinding,\" he says, \"I'd get there.

They decided on their first name, Psychedelic Breakfast, based on the suggestion of Tramontano's cousin. It is a reference to Pink Floyd's song \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" from their album Atom Heart Mother. Besides playing cover songs by classic rockers such as The Doors and Floyd, they released a self-titled DIY studio album in 1999. The band's popularity began to rise after four songs from this album were featured on the MTV series Undressed.\n\nThe band won their first Jammy for being \"New Groove of the Year\" in 2004. Around the same time, the band decided to change their name due to misnomers of the seriousness of the band leading to the loss of booking for shows and festivals. Spears defended the choice, though, saying that \"the Music is what is important, not the name.\" While supporting their 2005 release, Real Radio, the band performed a national tour, at times backing up popular bands such as The Wailers, moe., North Mississippi Allstars, and Gomez. In early July of 2006, Giangreco left and the band continued on as a trio.\n\nThe band is also known for a high level of musicianship. In the current incarnation, instrument swapping between members is not uncommon. Guitar virtuoso Tim Palmieri also plays keyboards, drums and bass. Both Spears and Tramontano are highly proficient guitar players. Tramontano also plays the keyboards. Such swaps are usually reserved for encores, and are especially well received by fans. Members of the Breakfast also share vocal duties. While lead vocals are typically handled by either Palmieri (a baritone) or Spears (a tenor), Tramontano will occasionally act as a lead vocalist, but is most often heard providing harmonies.\n\nOn August 3rd, 2007, it was announced that Matt Oestreicher will be joining the band as the new keyboardist.\n\nwww.thebreakfast.org - Official site", "otherInfo": "The Breakfast COVID Live Stream Episode 3 - performing The Doors' 1967 Self-titled debut album in its entirety plus a set of Breakfast originals."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mark De Clive-Lowe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10393310.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Los Angeles, United States", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Exploring culture through music...", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DAVE BRAY USA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8628524.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country, Rock And Country, Pop, Christian & Gospel, Acoustic Country, Rock N Roll, Christian Rock, Cover Songs, Opening Ceremonies, Rock, American Rock, Patriotic Rock, Patriotic, Rock & Pop, Rock & Country, Private Event, Folk Acoustic Rock, Acousic, Rock Alternative, Corporate Band, Acoustic & Acoustic Rock, Sports Anthems, Corporate Event, Story Teller", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dave Bray USA - Patriotic Entertainer\nDave Bray is a United States Navy Veteran.

MPress, distributed worldwide by Caroline/Universal via SRG-ILS Group, also releases albums by Rachael Sage, Seth Glier, and A Fragile Tomorrow.\n\nGrace Pettis is an award-winning songwriter from Austin, Texas who is a noted member of the South Austin scene. A little bit folk, a little bit country/Americana and with a whole lot of soul, Pettis has released two DIY albums and the Dallas Morning News has hailed her as \"one of the most talented young singer-songwriters in America\".\n\nPettis first came to the attention of MPress founder and President Rachael Sage at a SXSW party in Austin, where her voice and presence, even totally unplugged in a crowded room, commanded the spotlight. Sage gushes, \"Grace Pettis is one of the best singers I have ever had the pleasure to hear. And when I say 'best', I don't mean that in a showy way -\u2013 although her voice is both powerful and beautiful. I mean that she can tell a story with her voice in a way that cuts right to the heart of our collective humanity, whatever the topic may be. Her songwriting is nothing short of masterful, and to see these timeless qualities in someone so young feels like discovering something akin to the magic of Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash or perhaps, Brandi Carlile. MPress Records is thrilled to be working with Grace!\"\n\nPettis, who is repped by Chas Management, will be touring the southeastern US and Europe in winter/spring 2020. Her first release on MPress is expected later on in the year. In the meantime, she is eager to have found such a supportive new team. \"Signing a record deal sounds pretty daunting\", Pettis admits. \"It's not a decision to take lightly. But from the first conversation with Rachael Sage and her wonderful team, I've felt like I've finally found my way home. After a decade of releasing my own music, I couldn't be more thrilled to announce that I'm partnering with MPress Records, a label that has built its unique reputation on championing and supporting artists and putting music with integrity out into the world. I'm so proud to be a part of the MPress family.\"\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the south Austin scene, Grace Pettis has amassed bragging rights to spare. She is the winner of many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious songwriting contests, including NPR's Mountain Stage NewSong Contest, and has received grants from the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. Grace\u2019s songs have been recorded by other esteemed artists, including Sara Hickman and Ruthie Foster and she added to her songwriting accomplishments in 2019 by signing a publishing deal with BMG. Catch her with her band at an Austin club, headlining a festival with her trio Nobody's Girl, or on her own, trying out new songs in a little gem of a listening room, somewhere in America.", "otherInfo": "This week on...\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\ud83c\udfb6\u2728 \u0262\u0280\u1d00\u1d04\u1d07 \u1d18\u1d07\u1d1b\u1d1b\u026as & \u0493\u0280\u026a\u1d07\u0274\u1d05s \u1d21\u1d07\u1d07\u1d0b\u029f\u028f \u1d21\u1d07\u0299\u1d04\u1d00s\u1d1b \u2728\ud83c\udfb6\u2063 \u2063\u2063\u2063 \ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd5d \ud835\udd68\ud835\udd56\u2019\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd5d \ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd56.\ud83c\udf0e\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2728 My guest this Friday, May 29th, is Shawnee Kilgore.

There are two things she does well: fingerpick and play your heart strings. And also maybe make you laugh.

Though he remains among the most pop-friendly of today's singer-songwriters - his songs regularly appear in hit movie and TV soundtracks , fans say he has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger more successfully than any of his songwriting peers. According to an article by Stephen Thanabalan in Rolling Stone Magazine, Paul's style has also been most notably influential in the late 1990s thru mid 2000s with his prescience vis a vis his unique music and sound: featuring a combination of dextrously deep and smooth vocals as well as raw guitar 'roots' stylistics; emulated most evidently in the industry in ensuing years with the mainstream emergence of melancholic rock and folk pop solo artistes like Rascal Flatts, James Blunt, Damien Rice and Jack Johnson.", "otherInfo": "ELLIS PAUL\u2019S TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOW Returns this Friday May 29th at 7:30pm EST on Facebook Live at Ellis Paul Music and More!

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hannah Bethel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8231486.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Country Soulful Singer Songwriter", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Country singer and songwriter Hannah Bethel grew up listening to country music in the backwoods of Northern Michigan. Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

Would you like to get together sometime and play them?\" to try to get a date with violinist Josie Quick. Josie saw through to his true intention, but she also saw that he was sincere about his music. Well, Tom went home and set to work arranging his music with a violin in mind. A rehearsal date was set, and one of the first songs they did was to become the title song on their first CD, Ready, Willing, and Able.\n\nTom had been in a number of rock bands, and they had always met an early demise. He was ready to try a different tactic for getting a band going. This time he was going to create a core of two people that could work together, and build from there.\n\nJosie had been wanting to get more into playing jazz violin. The spontaneity of improvisation was intriguing to her. Problem was, there wasn't a lot of opportunity for getting together with other jazz musicians. Her violin was always drowned out by the other instruments, and electric violins and violin pickups hadn't yet come into use.\n\nThe time was right for these two to get together. Tom's use of open tunings and fingerstyle guitar gave Josie the inspiration to improvise contrapuntal melodies. At first their music was a combination of folk and classical, which can be heard on their first CD.\n\nAs time went on ttheir sound evolved to encompass any musical inspiration that came their way. Determined to break the mold of typical acoustic guitar and violin music, they dive into the blues, rock and roll, jazz, and anything else they can think of.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

If intergalactic energy beings, upon their initiation into an order of whirling dervishes, built a pan-dimensional booty-shaking engine powered by psychedelic math...it would sound like a cut-rate CTS cover band. With their blend of progressive rock and improvisatory jazz, soaked in Indian and Middle Eastern styles, CTS blends disparate elements into an utterly original whole. A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers.\n\nTheir latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity.\n\nFrom the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become. CTS retain their signature fiery maximalism while pushing the hooky, anthemic songwriting to the forefront. Bassist John Ferrara\u2019s new Taurus bass pedals and guitarist Gabriel Marin\u2019s new custom Vigier double-neck guitar add new dimensions to the band\u2019s already diverse sound.\n\nThis is an album born of comfort and growth. In the five years since World War Trio, the band has toured extensively, Marin and Ferrara have released side projects, and drummer/percussionist Jeff Mann has gone from a relative newcomer to a road-hardened veteran. After all this time, CTS knows how to create space for each other, how to finish each other\u2019s musical thoughts and sentences, how to think as three individuals but speak with one voice. You Are Literally a Metaphor is a statement of confidence, an assertion of identity from a band with no reservations and nothing to prove.\n\nCTS have performed in a half-dozen countries across three continents. They have shared the stage with a wide variety of artists, including: Victor Wooten, King Crimson Projekt, Wyclef Jean, Ozric Tentacles, Soulive, The Disco Biscuits, Papadosio, Turkuaz, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Wayne Krantz and many others.

As he learned about Mozart, Bach and others, he began to realize that contemporary music is very simply the music of the pepople. The overtures and opuses of the 1700s were the popular songs of that era. People identified with those songs in the same way that today's \u201chits\u201d appeal to the masses of this generation. As a songwriter, specifically for liturgy in 2017, the question that provokes him is: How do I create a song that will honor traditions and music yet speak to the modern Church and lead them to worship?\n\nJosh collaborated with his guitar player, Grae McCullough, to write a new mass setting, paying homage to the hymns of the past and the culture of modern worship. \u201cEvery week we lead music for school and parish masses, so we knew we needed something that would resonate with all ages. We also wanted it to be joyful, approachable and easy to sing but still fresh, dynamic and expressive,\u201d says Blakesley.\n\nOn March 3, 2017 is the release of this long-awaited project called Mass of Restoration. It is available now anywhere music can be downloaded. For sheet music, please visit ocp.org\n\nJosh Blakesley's last full-length album, Even in This, was recorded in 2015 in Franklin, TN with Grammy Nominated producer/singer- songwriter, Michael Farren. The album features songs co-written with Farren, Mia Fieldes (Hillsong), Dove Award winner Marc Byrd (God of Wonders) and Grammy Award Nominated, Sarah Hart (Better than a Hallelujah).\n\nThe title track from the album is a song about finding hope in the darkest valleys of life. It was born out of tragedy after the band's guitar player, Grae McCullough, lost his one-month-old daughter to a chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18. \"The peace I had the day Lizzie's short life ended could have only been God. There was an underlying sense of peace in the devastation and the song really encapsulates the situation we were in,\" says McCoullough.\n\nBlakesley has been featured on Sirius XM, EWTN\u2019s Life on the Rock, Relevant Radio, KLOVE and has performed with wide variety of Christian artists like Matt Maher, Andrew Peterson, Jars of Clay and the Newsboys; as well as several International Papal events, most recently in Milan, Italy in 2012. He continues to tour heavily with dates booked all over the US and Canada in 2017. He partners with Compassion International as a spokesperson for releasing children from poverty in Jesus\u2019 name.

They formed in Crested Butte, Colorado in 1993, originally playing local gigs at ski resorts in exchange for free lift tickets.\n\nTheir music is strongly influenced by bluegrass sounds, as well as forays into rock, funk, jazz, Latin, reggae, and occasional psychedelia. A fusion of these genres can be heard in most of their songs as well as covers.\n\nThe String Cheese Incident has been described as a democratic ensemble rather than a band, since all of the members contribute their own original compositions to the group's burgeoning library and share the vocal burden on a number of cover versions as well as their own songs. If a de facto leader had to be named, such a title would probably fall upon Nershi, who is responsible for the bulk of the group's original song library.\n\nAdapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_Cheese_Incident", "otherInfo": "Join us for the latest edition of Friday Night Cheese!

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in The Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and The Beatles coverband\n\n\nDiscography\n\n* Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n* Uncivilized Area (1998)\n* Bisco Lives (2000)\n* They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n* Se\u00f1or Boombox (2002)\n* TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n* Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n* Rocket 3 (2007)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fat Joe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7303966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rap, Hip-hop, Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fat Joe (born Joseph Cartagena on August 19, 1970) is an American rapper.
